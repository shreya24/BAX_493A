"Abstract: Nanodermatology has been an emerging area of research and drug development in the last two decades. Nanodermatology lies at the intersection of nanotechnology, chemical engineering, biophysics, and pharmacology. Increasing research has yielded potential benefits of nanotechnology in the treatment of various skin conditions via enhanced transdermal drug delivery. Nanoparticles, defined as particles ranging from 1 to 1000 nanometers, have been more frequently explored for their potential role in targeted drug delivery systems. Nanocarriers, which include liposomes, ethosomes, and vesicle carriers, have been increasingly investigated to improve efficacy of various drugs via enhanced delivery to the target site. Many dermatologic conditions are preferentially treated with topical formulations to locally target the affected area and reduce systemic absorption, but these formulations are limited in their penetration. The ability of topical formulations to effectively deliver active ingredients to the target site is uncertain, therefore nanoparticles have been increasingly investigated as an approach to boost drug delivery to the deeper layers of the skin, improve absorption, and decrease adverse effects. Enhanced drug delivery utilizing nanoparticles has been successfully trialed for treatment of psoriasis, vitiligo, acne vulgaris, and atopic dermatitis in many research studies, however more investigation is needed prior to utilization in humans.

"BACKGROUND: Drugs, chemicals, and poisons may damage kidneys and cause chronic renal disease. About 20% of community and hospital acute renal failures are drug-related. OBJECTIVES: Hesperidin-loaded bilosomes (HES-BS) nanoformula was tested for nephroprotection against methotrexate (MTX)-induced kidney injury in rats. Thin-film hydration produced HES-BS nanoformula. Drug-loading capacity, encapsulation efficiency (EE %), FTIR, DSC, zeta sizer, and potential were employed for characterization, coupled with an in vitro release study. In vivo pharmacological investigations on White male albino rats measured metabolic parameters, oxidative stress indicators, Nrf2 /Keap1 and BCL2/Bax gene expression, and histopathological alterations. RESULTS: The HES-BS nanoformula was synthesized with 162 nm particles and - 21.6 mv potential charge. The Transmissions electron microscopy (TEM) showed spherical HES-BS. Hesperidin-excipient compatibility was shown by FTIR and DSC investigations on the modified formulation, with 89.1% EE%. In vitro drug release showed 56% release after eight hours and 60.1% after 24 h, with greater bioavailability than crude HES. The IC₅₀ value of hesperidin decreased from 264 µg/mL to 106.2 µg/mL upon bilosome loading in Vero cells. MTX's nephrotoxicity was mitigated by the HES-BS nano formula's effects on creatinine, urea, uric acid, eGFR, Na, and K levels. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and Nitric Oxide (NO) were notably decreased, whereas Glutathione (GSH) and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) were markedly elevated. Also, Nrf2 and Bcl2 were upregulated, while Keap1 and Bax were downregulated. Additionally, the produced nanoformula improved the histopathological function. CONCLUSION: Our novel HES-BS nanoformula had potent nephroprotective activity by reducing the toxic effects of MTX treatment by improving biochemical indicators of kidney function, oxidative stress markers, anti-apoptotic gene expression, and apoptotic gene expression, as well as histopathological improvement.

"Abstract: Trichinellosis is a ubiquitous parasitic infection caused by a zoonotic nematode known as Trichinella spiralis (T. spiralis). It starts with the adult worm in the intestinal phase and ends up with the larva reaching the muscles. The disease generally manifests with acute gastroenteritis; however, it may regrettably lead to life-threatening myositis, myocarditis and seizures. The commercially existing chemotherapeutic regimens have numerous drawbacks including severe adverse effects, high resistance rate, poor bioavailability and low efficiency towards the muscular stage. Consequently, the current study targeted the evaluation of nitazoxanide-loaded zinc oxide nanoparticles (NTZ-loaded ZnO NPs) used for the first time in the treatment of both the intestinal and muscular phases of trichinellosis in mice. Swiss Albino mice were orally infected by 250 T. spiralis larvae. The experimental animals were treated with the gold standard albendazole, NTZ, ZnO NPs as well as NTZ-loaded ZnO NPs. Parasitological, biochemical (creatine kinase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, malondialdehyde and nitric oxide), immunological (interleukins 2 and 4) and histopathological assessments were conducted. The parasitological results denoted that the mice treated with NTZ-loaded ZnO NPs revealed the uppermost significant drug efficacy (>97%) in both the intestinal and muscular phases indicating efficacious tissue penetration. Additionally, this group revealed the most profound amelioration of the biochemical and immunological markers as well as restoration of the histopathological picture. Conclusively, the present work implied a bird's eye view on the promising effectiveness of NTZ-loaded ZnO NPs in the treatment of murine trichinellosis relying on the anti-parasitic safe nature of the formulation.

"BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris is one of the most common dermatological illnesses affecting people worldwide. In Pakistan, approximately 9.4% of the population and between 5% and 16% of young adults are affected by acne vulgaris. Conventional therapies (topical benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, antibiotics and oral isotretinoin) are effective but limited by antibiotic resistance and side effects. Curcumin (a natural anti-inflammatory/antimicrobial from turmeric) and serratiopeptidase (a proteolytic enzyme with anti-inflammatory, anti-oedematous and antibiofilm properties) each show promise in acne treatment. This article evaluates the efficacy of a combined oral curcumin plus serratiopeptidase formulation as an adjunct to inflammatory acne therapy. METHODS: Fifty individuals with mild-to-moderate symptoms of inflammatory acne participated in this quasi-experimental study. They were allocated to standard therapy alone (topical regimen: benzoyl peroxide 5% and adapalene 0.1% gel; oral doxycycline 100 mg once daily) or standard therapy plus a daily curcumin (500 mg) + serratiopeptidase (10 mg) supplement (adjunctive therapy). Acne severity was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and lesion improvement scale at baseline, 1 week and 2 weeks of treatment. Data were analysed with parametric tests after normalization (log transformation), with significance set at  RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between groups (mean age: 23 years; 66% female). Both groups showed significant improvement in mean VAS (from 7.5 at baseline to 3.1 at 2 weeks;  CONCLUSION: Curcumin plus serratiopeptidase, as an adjunct to standard therapy significantly, accelerated the resolution of inflammatory acne lesions within 2 weeks, with excellent tolerability. This novel combination targets inflammatory pathways and could reduce reliance on prolonged antibiotics. Larger, longer-term studies are recommended to confirm these findings and evaluate effects on relapse and scarring. "
"Abstract: This review summarizes the off-label applications of topical sirolimus (rapamycin) for dermatological conditions beyond its approved use for angiofibromas associated with tuberous sclerosis, focusing on efficacy, safety, and reported adverse effects. Off-label use of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors like sirolimus has shown promising potential in dermatology. We analyzed the literature on the efficacy and safety of topical sirolimus for a range of dermatological conditions, including inflammatory eruptions, genodermatoses, bullous disorders, neoplasms, and others. Publications on topical sirolimus for other vascular anomalies, such as lymphatic malformations, were excluded to maintain focus on other lesser-known dermatological uses, except for studies involving post-laser combination therapies for vascular lesions. Topical sirolimus demonstrated notable efficacy in several genetic and benign proliferative skin disorders, including pachyonychia congenita, trichilemmomas, trichoepitheliomas, and Kaposi sarcoma, with a generally favorable safety profile and minimal systemic absorption. However, variability in formulations, dosing regimens, and the predominance of small-scale studies limit definitive conclusions. Further research is warranted to standardize treatment protocols and validate these findings. "
"Abstract: Visible light (400-700nm) comprises 45% of the sunlight spectrum and can induce both immediate and persistent skin darkening, as well as worsen dyschromia, especially in the skin of color population. In a recent mini-zone study, we demonstrated that iron oxide (FeO)-containing formulations could protect skin from visible light-induced pigmentation in Fitzpatrick skin type (FST) IV individuals, while ultraviolet (UV) protection sunscreen SPF 50+ (sun protection factor) could not. To assess the benefit of adding FeO-containing foundation into real-life daily sun care routine in improving the appearance of photodamage and melasma, we evaluated the efficacy of two sun protection regimens (SPF50 alone and SPF50+FeO) in healthy women of FST III to VI for 12 weeks. Clinical evaluation and colorimetric measurement showed that both regimens significantly improved skin quality and overall appearance over 12 weeks compared to baseline. At week 4, the photodamage subgroup using SPF50+FeO showed early improvement over baseline in skin roughness (visual and tactile). The melasma subgroup using SPF50+FeO showed early improvement in overall healthy appearance. At week 12, although both groups showed improvement in colorimetric measurements (L*), the response was different: 36% of melasma participants in the SPF50+FeO group showed superior improvement in their skin radiance (L*) vs 0% in the SPF50 group. A self-assessment questionnaire revealed that SPF50+FeO enhanced the quality of life in participants with melasma. This study demonstrated the importance of including visible light protection into a daily sun care routine, especially for melasma: masking and improving existing conditions indoors and outdoors at the same time.

"BACKGROUND: Hyperpigmentation and periorbital dark circles remain challenging dermatological concerns due to their multifactorial etiology, including vascular, pigmentary, and structural components. This study evaluates the efficacy of a novel multi-action topical formulation designed to target hyperpigmentation and skin aging through a synergistic blend of active ingredients. OBJECTIVE: To assess the objective and clinical effects of a dermatological composition containing niacinamide, arbutin, tranexamic acid, ubiquinone, a DHEA-like component, curcuma oily extract, and marine exopolysaccharides on periorbital hyperpigmentation and skin quality. METHODS: Subjects with visible under-eye dark circles applied the formulation twice daily over a treatment period of 6 weeks. The evaluation included instrumental quantitative assessments of skin pigmentation along with standardized imaging. A separate safety study and cosmetic efficacy questionnaire of patient experience were completed. RESULTS: The formulation demonstrated statistically significant improvements in pigmentation intensity. The twice daily use of the under-eye serum resulted in an average overall reduction in under-eye hyperpigmentation of 47.94%, with no adverse effects observed. CONCLUSION: This novel topical composition offers a safe and effective multi-targeted approach for improving periorbital hyperpigmentation and promoting overall skin rejuvenation. The synergistic action of its active components supports its use in clinical and aesthetic dermatology for the treatment of dark circles and age-related changes. "

"Abstract: Methotrexate-encapsulated solid lipid nanoparticles (MTX-SLNs) and lactoferrin-decorated MTX-loaded nanoparticles (MTX-Lf-SLNs) present a promising strategy for treating colorectal cancer. Among different molecular targets, MTX demonstrated the highest affinity for Caspase-6, exhibiting a docking score of -9.316, while molecular dynamics validated stable interactions. The optimized nanoparticles displayed a spherical shape (~ 160 nm, as observed in TEM images) with a high drug encapsulation efficiency of 85.87% for MTX-SLNs and 80.11% for MTX-Lf-SLNs, which ensured improved stability. Structural analyses using FTIR, DSC confirmed effective drug encapsulation and the binding of lactoferrin. Interestingly, MTX-Lf-SLNs demonstrated higher cytotoxicity (IC50: 0.51 µM) compared to MTX-SLNs and free MTX, inducing apoptosis and stopping cell cycle progression in HCT116 cells. This improved effect was associated with receptor-driven absorption through lactoferrin targeting. Nanoparticulate formulations decreased TNF-α (17.6 ± 2.1 pg/mL), IL-6 (20.2 ± 1.9 pg/mL), and IL-1β (15.4 ± 3.4 pg/mL), thereby reducing immune activation. The nanoparticles exhibited extended, pH-sensitive drug release (70% at pH 5.7) and significant anti-angiogenic effects (~ 70% inhibition in CAM assay). Moreover, they enhanced the balance of reactive oxygen species and safeguarded mitochondria, thereby lowering overall toxicity. Migration assays further validated their capacity to obstruct cancer cell invasiveness, suggesting a potential to impede metastasis. Utilizing the bioactivity of lactoferrin for precise delivery, MTX-Lf-SLNs offer an attractive approach to enhance anti colon cancer efficacy while reducing unwanted side effects. "
"PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE: This review emphasizes the significance of emerging drug delivery technologies and explores potential avenues for future dermatological treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hyperpigmentation is a prevalent skin condition characterized by dark patches due to excessive melanin production. Various forms, such as melasma, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and UV induced pigmentation, arise from a complex interplay of genetic factors, inflammation, hormonal fluctuations, and light exposure. While conventional topical treatments, including azelaic acid, retinoids, hydroquinone, and kojic acid, remain effective, their use is often limited by adverse effects like skin irritation, blistering, and sensitivity. To address these challenges, advanced drug delivery systems have been developed to improve therapeutic efficacy, enhance formulation stability, and enable targeted delivery, thereby minimizing potential side effects. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Advanced vesicular carriers, including liposomes, niosomes, lipid nanoparticles, and nano-emulsions, offer enhanced drug penetration, bioavailability, and reduced toxicity. However, achieving sustained results and preventing recurrence remain critical challenges in hyperpigmentation management. Recent advancements in personalized treatment strategies and novel delivery methods provide promising solutions for safer and more effective therapies. Additionally, procedural interventions such as chemical peels and micro-needling have demonstrated encouraging results in managing chronic hyperpigmentation. "

"AIM: This multicenter retrospective study evaluated the differential impact of concomitant methotrexate (MTX) and glucocorticoids (GCs) administration by dosage on the effectiveness and safety of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) in a real-world cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, adjusting for clinical backgrounds variables. METHODS: The study included 3751 treatment courses (bDMARD- or JAKi-naïve cases, 48.9%; tumor necrosis factor inhibitors: 1668; tocilizumab [TCZ]: 865; abatacept [ABT]: 825; JAKi: 393). Hazard ratios for treatment retention were calculated using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for potential confounders. Improvement in the clinical disease activity index (ΔCDAI) with each formulation was analyzed using mixed-effects models for repeated measures, stratified by concomitant MTX and GCs dosages. RESULTS: Compared to MTX(-), a lower dose of MTX (< 10 mg/week) was associated with significant improvement in ΔCDAI with golimumab (GLM), TCZ, and JAKi and reduced discontinuation due to ineffectiveness of etanercept (ETN). A higher MTX dose (≥ 10 mg/week) demonstrated a similar trend. Compared to GCs(-), a lower dose of GCs (≤ 5 mg/day; prednisolone equivalent) was associated with a diminished ΔCDAI with GLM and an increased discontinuation due to ineffectiveness of ADA and GLM. A higher dose of GCs (> 5 mg/day) was associated with increased discontinuation due to safety with ETN, CZP, and JAKi. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of concomitant MTX and GCs dosages on the effectiveness and safety of biologics and JAKi vary among agents. MTX did not mitigate safety issues, and GCs did not enhance effectiveness of any agents, regardless of dosage. "
"Abstract: Topical drug delivery systems offer a targeted and patient-compliant approach for managing psoriasis, enabling noninvasive, localized, and sustained therapy, with reduced systemic side effects and improved therapeutic outcomes. In this study, we prepared phospholipid complex (PLC) based gel of methotrexate (MTX) and erlotinib (ERL) as a potential dual treatment for psoriasis. The phospholipids used in this study were biocompatible and exhibited enhanced skin permeation. The physical interactions between drugs and phospholipids in the MTX-loaded phospholipid complex (MPLC) and ERL-loaded phospholipid complex (EPLC) were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( "
"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Visible light (VL), a substantial component of solar radiation, contributes to skin photodamage, including hyperpigmentation and erythema. Tinted sunscreens have emerged as effective tools for mitigating VL-induced effects, yet challenges remain in their adoption and utilization. This review updates recent evidence on their clinical efficacy and explores obstacles constraining their broader recognition and utilization. METHODS: A comprehensive search was performed on December 28, 2024, across MEDLINE, PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Web of Science using Mesh Terms ""visible light,"" ""sunscreens,"" and keywords related to ""tinted sunscreen."" A total of 89 articles were initially retrieved. After screening for relevance and recent publication, 67 articles were selected for detailed review. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Tinted sunscreens outperform non-tinted products in protecting against VL-induced photodamage and managing melasma relapse, extending photoprotection beyond UV radiation. However, their adoption is limited by the lack of standardized guidelines and unified evaluation metrics, and inadequate shade diversity for skin of color. Future research should focus on expanding shade ranges, establishing comprehensive evaluation standards, and refining formulations with active ingredients. "
"BACKGROUND: The development of sunscreens with properties beyond photoprotection involves carefully optimizing the blend of ingredients and employing advanced systems to ensure effective delivery through the skin layers. AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a multifunctional photoprotective formulation containing a blend of nanoencapsulated ingredients-ascorbyl palmitate, caffeine, and resveratrol-and the active ingredients niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, bisabolol, tocopherol, and carnosine in skin protection against UV and blue light radiations, by in vitro, ex vivo, and clinical studies. METHODS: A preclinical approach using human explants was performed to evaluate the protective effects of a sunscreen formulation against damage induced by UV and blue light radiation. In addition, a clinical trial was carried out to evaluate skin acceptability, protection from UV-A and UV-B, collagen synthesis by fluorescence spectroscopy, and skin hydration. RESULTS: The results of the preclinical study showed that the proposed formulation prevented UV-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and stimulated the levels of epidermal opsin-3 photoreceptors, ensuring melanogenesis control. The clinical study showed that the sunscreen was well-tolerated by both skin and eyes, improved skin conditions by upregulating collagen synthesis, and moisturizing the skin. CONCLUSION: The combination of the active ingredients in the proposed formulation was safe and effective for skin protection against ultraviolet radiation, besides promoting collagen synthesis and opsin-3 stimulus.

"Abstract: Rosacea is a common dermatological disease, and the complexity of its etiology and pathogenesis makes conventional treatment of rosacea difficult. Small-molecule drugs are a new option for the treatment of rosacea. Based on its good efficacy, convenience of use, affordable price and other advantages, more and more small-molecule drugs are used in the treatment and management of rosacea, involving a variety of molecular pathways, including JAK/STAT signaling pathway, TRPV, TLR2-KLK5-LL37 and mTOR pathways, Th1/Th17-IL17, PED-4, AhR and MRGPRX2. However, the specific treatment mechanism and research progress have not been systematically elucidated. This review summarizes the latest advances in small molecules targeting key inflammatory pathways in rosacea, provides new ideas for the treatment of rosacea and new directions for the clinical management of rosacea. In addition, we need to pay attention to individual differences in patients, the side effects of drugs and formulations. Therefore, further research on small-molecule drugs for the treatment of rosacea is very necessary. "
"Abstract: Cantharidin, a natural toxin produced by the blister beetle, is a topical agent that induces acantholysis of the epidermis, breaking down desmosome plaques through the release of serine proteases. Cantharidin is available in three liquid forms: Ycanth (0.7%), Canthacur (0.7%), and Canthacur PS (1% cantharidin, 30% salicylic acid, 2% podophyllotoxin). Ycanth is used to treat molluscum contagiosum (MC). Canthacur is routinely used to treat a variety of dermatologic conditions including MC, plantar warts, and common warts, whereas Canthacur PS is a more potent formulation indicated for treatment of plantar warts only. The objective of this review is to highlight the efficacy, safety, and diverse use of topical cantharidin in the treatment of various skin conditions. Conditions in which treatment with topical cantharidin yielded a good-to-excellent response include MC, plantar warts, and common warts. Topical cantharidin treatment of anogenital warts yielded mixed results. None of the indications reviewed herein yielded a poor response to topical cantharidin. Overall, topical cantharidin resulted in a good-to-excellent clinical response in several conditions with mild and transient adverse events. The results of this review suggest the safe and efficacious use of topical cantharidin in the field of dermatology and highlight the potential for future use. "
"Abstract: Irinotecan (IRN), a camptothecin derivative, has limited and inadequate oral absorption due to efflux pump activity by intestinal P-glycoprotein receptors. To complete these challenges, we designed and fabricated irinotecan and cyclosporine. A coloaded self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (CO-IR-CP-SNs) can effectively prevent P-gp efflux and P450 enzyme metabolization, increasing oral bioavailability. To date, this combination has not been reported, which gives uniqueness to our formulation. The CO-IR-CP-SNs were fabricated by using the Box-Behnken design tool with Capryol 90, Cremophor EL, and PEG-400 as the oil, surfactant, and co-surfactant, respectively. The optimized CO-IR-CP-SNs had an average globule size of 16.36 ± 1.09 nm and a polydispersity index of 0.250 ± 0.01. The combination index value supports the existence of synergy in human colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT-116). The combination index shows a value of 0.78, which is <1, indicating synergism. Coloaded SNEDDS (CO-IR-CP-SNs) showed greater cellular uptake, reactive oxygen species generation, and apoptosis. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated a 14-fold and 6.08-fold increase in  "
"Abstract: Protein kinase CK2 has emerged as a pivotal regulator of cellular processes involved in skin homeostasis, including cell proliferation, differentiation and inflammatory response regulation. In fact, CK2 activity dysregulation is implicated in the pathogenesis of different skin diseases, such as psoriasis, cancer and inflammatory dermatoses. CK2 overactivation fosters keratinocyte proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production through the STAT3 and Akt pathways in psoriasis, thus contributing to epidermal hyperplasia and inflammation. In the realm of oncology, CK2 overexpression correlates with tumor progression, facilitating cell survival and metastasis in melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers. Pharmacological inhibition of CK2 has demonstrated therapeutic potential, with CX-4945 (Silmitasertib) as the most studied adenosine triphosphate-competitive inhibitor (ATP-competitive inhibitor). Preclinical models reveal that CK2 inhibitors effectively mitigate pathological features of psoriasis, regulate keratinocyte differentiation, and suppress tumor growth in skin cancers. These inhibitors also potentiate the efficacy of conventional chemotherapeutics and exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in dermatological conditions. Future research will aim to enhance the specificity and delivery of CK2-targeting therapies, including topical formulations, to minimize systemic side effects. Combination therapies integrating CK2 inhibitors with other agents might offer synergistic benefits in managing skin diseases. This review underscores CK2's critical role in skin and its therapeutic potential as a pharmacological target, advocating for innovative approaches to harness CK2 inhibition in dermatology. "
"Abstract: Lignin, a renewable biopolymer, has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional UV filters in sunscreen formulations due to its photoprotective properties and sustainability. Chemical modifications such as esterification, alkylation, and grafting can improve lignin's solubility and UV absorption, while physical modifications like nanoparticle formation and freeze-drying enhance its dispersion and stability. The antioxidant activity of lignin, attributed to its polyphenolic structure, provides additional benefits for skin health and anti-ageing formulations. Synergistic effects with other antioxidants further enhance its potential. The mechanism by which lignin absorbs UV light involves the activation of electrons in its aromatic ring structures. Meanwhile, its antioxidant properties are mainly due to its capacity to capture free radicals and deactivate reactive oxygen species. The effect of structural modifications on photostability and sunscreen performance is significant, with modified lignin formulations exhibiting enhanced UV protection, improved photostability, and better compatibility compared to their unmodified counterparts. Despite challenges in formulation, consumer acceptance, and scalability, lignin-based sunscreens offer a sustainable and effective solution for UV protection. This review explores the potential of lignin-based sunscreens, focusing on structural modification and antioxidant properties for enhanced UV protection. The literature search covers studies published between 2016 and 2025. "
"Abstract: Category III Non-GRASE (Generally Recognized as Safe and Effective) UV filters (UVFs), such as avobenzone, octocrylene, oxybenzone, octinoxate, octisalate, and homosalate, face two significant challenges: photodegradation and systemic absorption. Many of these UVFs break down when exposed to sunlight, reducing their effectiveness and generating potentially harmful byproducts which will absorbed by the body. Researchers have developed various stabilization strategies to address these challenges and enhance UVF performance while minimizing health risks. Encapsulation techniques, such as embedding UVFs in silica, liposomes, and polymer matrices, help reduce systemic absorption while maintaining UV protection. Nano-Hybrid organic-inorganic formulations, a nano-scale version of pairing between organic and inorganic UVFs, have also shown promise in improving photostability and preventing degradation. Additionally, polymeric UVFs and controlled-release systems offer long-lasting sun protection, ensuring that the active ingredients remain effective over time. Multi-phase emulsions and layered sunscreen formulations further reduce photodegradation, providing more stable and reliable UV protection. With increasing regulatory scrutiny and growing concerns about environmental and human health impacts, this review explores the dual challenge (balancing stability and safety) faced by non-GRASE UVFs. By integrating advanced materials and innovative formulation technologies, next-generation sunscreens have the potential to deliver superior photoprotection while being safe to human. "

"Abstract: Mosquito bites are prevalent occurrences among various populations worldwide, mosquito repellent chemical components (MRCCs) have been extensively utilized. MRCCs have been frequently identified in environmental settings nowadays. However, the implications of these compounds on skin conditions, particularly Atopic Dermatitis (AD), are not well understood. In this investigation, we analyzed three commercially available MRCCs: DEET (N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide), IR3535 (ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate), and picaridin (2-(2-hydroxyethyl)-piperidinecarboxylic acid 1-methyl ester). A comprehensive analysis was conducted utilizing various databases to identify potential targets associated with exposure to these MRCCs and their correlation with AD. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses revealed that exposure to these MRCCs influences inflammation-related pathways. Additionally, molecular docking studies indicated significant binding affinities of DEET, IR3535, and picaridin to critical core targets and receptor proteins. Furthermore, a series of cellular assays were conducted to empirically evaluate the actual effects of these three MRCCs on the induction of AD. The results suggest that MRCCs may facilitate the progression of AD by influencing inflammatory processes. This study provides a conceptual framework for understanding the association between MRCCs and the risk of AD, thereby contributing to the formulation of strategies aimed at mitigating their effects on dermatological disorders.

"Abstract: Capsicum oleoresin, an active ingredient in hot peppers of the genus Capsicum, is abundant in capsaicinoids. It offers significant health benefits, however due to its high pungency, this makes its pure form very challenging to consume orally. The main aim of this study is to prepare Capsicum oleoresin microparticles for oral delivery and to characterize and evaluate their cytotoxicity, in vitro stability and controlled release in gastrointestinal conditions. Gum Arabic (GA), OSA-modified corn starch (EMCAP), modified malt (MALT), and their ratio 1:1 combination (GA: EMCAP; EMCAP: MALT; MALT: GA) were employed as wall materials resulting in six different oil-in-water emulsions containing 15 % solids (5 % Capsicum oleoresin and 95 % wall material). These formulations were homogenized and spray dried. The encapsulation efficiency of each formulation was determined by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC). The formulated microparticles, individual microparticle components, and Capsicum oleoresin were tested for cytotoxicity on human intestinal monolayers Caco-2 and HepG2 liver cells. Furthermore, the INFOGEST static in vitro simulation assessed the digestion of microparticles using UPLC to obtain % capsaicin release. The highest encapsulation efficiency was obtained for EMCAP: MALT (90.4 %), MALT: GA (90.2 %), and GA (90.5 %). LC-QToF analysis identified capsinoids, capsaicinoids, and organic compounds in Capsicum oleoresin and microparticles. Identification of these components was also confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. All particles exhibited irregular surfaces, teeth concavities, and different sizes typical of spray-dried particles using carbohydrates as wall material. In vitro, cytotoxicity studies of all formulations with five concentrations ranging from 5 to 100 μg/ml showed no significant cytotoxicity after exposure times of 4 h on Caco-2 and 72 h on HepG2 cells. Microparticles resulted in higher degradation of color and capsaicin during storage at 45 °C compared to at 25 °C. In vitro digestion showed MALT: GA microparticles started with a 7.4 % release in the oral phase after 2 min of digestion. A further 2 h incubation in simulated gastric fluid resulted in a cumulative release of 25 %, followed by 78.6 % of capsaicin after 4 h in the intestinal fluid. This data reassures us about MALT: GA's effective capsaicin delivery potential, which presents a better profile of delivering capsaicin in high amounts into the intestine. These findings contribute to developing more efficient delivery systems, providing new insights into bioactive compounds' stability, released profiles, and safety, thus paving the way for improved applications in functional foods.

"Abstract: Recent developments in sunscreen formulations have been made to enhance sunscreen films formed on the surface of the skin. Film formation is of particular interest for sunscreens because the ability of solubilized ultraviolet (UV) filters to adhere to the skin's surface in such a way that they efficiently absorb UV light is a significant determinant of sun protection factor (SPF) value. Additionally, methods of stabilizing sunscreen films at the formulation level are of interest due to the degradation of sunscreen on skin-like substrates overtime. We note that traditional solvent-based spectroscopic methods of measuring sunscreens' efficacy capture only a portion of the story when it comes to determining SPF value and photoprotective properties of sunscreens on human skin. In this forward-looking review, we highlight strategies for enhancing film formation in sunscreens using hydrocarbon film formers and carbon nanomaterials. We discuss challenges of maintaining adhesion of sunscreen films on skin-like substrates, outline properties of hydrocarbon film formers and carbon nanomaterials for improving photoprotection, and present best practices for analyzing sunscreen films at the formulation level. Overall, this review provides insights relevant for sunscreen formulators and clinicians who develop and evaluate sunscreen efficacy. "

"BACKGROUND: Cirrhosis is considered as a severe liver disease that causes partial liver damage as well as total liver destruction; It remains a significant health concern. Sugar cane juice is a particularly beneficial beverage, and its waste products are crucial for treating numerous illnesses. As compared to traditional treatments, zinc-doped carbon quantum dots (Zn/CQDs) are easy-to-prepare, economically invested, high nutritive value and environmentally safe substance. MATERIALS & METHODS: This study investigated the hepatoprotective effects of zinc-doped carbon quantum dots (Zn/CQDs) against carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄)-induced liver injury in male Wistar albino rats. Zn/CQDs were synthesized using a microwave-assisted method and characterized using FTIR and XRD techniques. Meanwhile, a liver Cirrhosis model induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl RESULTS: In this study, Zn/CQDs were extended from 1.62 to 5.45 nm. The results demonstrated that Zn/CQDs exhibited significant hepatoprotective effects by reducing liver enzyme levels and mitigating histopathological changes. However, the study also highlighted the need for further optimization of the used vehicle delivery method, such as sugarcane juice, which is showed a marginal impact on liver function. Sugar cane juice with Zn/CQDs decreased aspartate amino transferase levels (AST) and improved the uric acid concentration. It means a protection from the toxins effect by controlling the liver enzyme levels; but also, elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) indicate ongoing liver injury. Overall, this study provides future insights into the potential of sugar cane juice with Zn/CQDs as a high nutritive value additive to drinks and food; it is investigated for plants waste as a novel green therapeutic strategy for liver diseases. Further research is necessary to explore the underlying mechanisms of action and to optimize their formulation for clinical applications. CONCLUSION: Overall, this study provides promising insights into the potential of Zn/CQDs as a novel green therapeutic strategy for liver diseases. "
"Abstract: Effective acne treatment is critical due to its profound impact on physical and psychological well-being. It was shown that severe systemic side effects, including teratogenicity, ovarian reserve reduction, depression, dry skin, hypertriglyceridemia, and intracranial hypertension limited oral isotretinoin usage. Therefore, this study addresses these challenges by developing isotretinoin-loaded lipid liquid crystal (LLC-IT) nanoparticles for topical application, aiming to enhance localized delivery while minimizing systemic exposure. LLC-IT nanoparticles were prepared using a top-down method and evaluated for their physicochemical properties, photostability, cytotoxicity, antimicrobial activity, in-vitro drug release, and in-vivo therapeutic efficacy. A testosterone-induced acne mouse model was used to compare LLC-IT treatment with untreated and commercial isotretinoin gel-treated groups. LLC-IT nanoparticles exhibited a uniform particle size (69.57 ± 0.51 nm), low polydispersity index (0.264 ± 0.01), and stable zeta potential (- 19.3 ± 0.2 mV). High encapsulation efficiency (95% ± 3) and effective loading capacity (1.15% ± 0.13) were achieved. Drug release was diffusion-controlled with minimal UV-induced degradation. Stability assessments over 12 months confirmed consistent properties across varying storage temperatures. LLC-IT displayed significant antibacterial activity and reduced skin irritation in Draize tests compared to commercial gels. In-vivo, LLC-IT reduced inflammation significantly more than untreated or commercial gel-treated groups, indicating enhanced therapeutic efficacy of LLC-IT formulation. The isotretinoin-loaded lipid liquid crystal formulation shows superior stability and efficacy with reduced side effects compared to conventional treatments, offering a more effective and patient-friendly solution, as well as a promising alternative for industrial production in acne management.

"BACKGROUND: Treatment with fluocinolone acetonide, hydroquinone, and tretinoin cream is the gold standard for melasma; however, the effects of this treatment in the Chinese population remain unclear. Due to the differences between Chinese and Caucasian subjects, further clinical trials in Chinese patients with melasma are needed. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fluocinolone acetonide, hydroquinone, and tretinoin creams in Chinese patients with moderate-to-severe melasma. METHODS: We recruited 53 patients who received a generic formulation (triple combination cream, TCC), brand formulation (TRI-LUMA), or placebo once daily for 8 weeks. In weeks 4 and 8, efficacy was evaluated based on the Melasma Severity Scale and Melasma Area and Severity Index. In addition, safety was assessed based on the incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events. RESULTS: The generic TCC group achieved 52.2% efficacy compared to 57.1% in the TRI-LUMA group. There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse effects between the TCC and TRI-LUMA groups (69.6% and 90.5%, respectively; p > 0.05). The incidence of adverse events in the placebo group was 0%. CONCLUSION: Generic TCC was as effective as TRI-LUMA and had a similar safety profile in this study of Chinese subjects with moderate-to-severe melasma. "

"Abstract: Fabrication of new 3D scaffold based on sodium alginate (SA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), sesame protein isolate (SPI) and Zinc nanoparticles (ZnNPs) has been prepared. SPI was extracted and evaluated via its amino acid composition, solubility, and antioxidant activity. The scaffolds were formulated with different ratios of SA/PVA/Zn/SPI and investigated via different instruments FTIR, XRD and SEM/EDX. Additionally, the effect of the scaffold on the hepato-protection and immune-stimulating in methotrexate (MTX) treated rats has been studied. The results showed that SPI rich in Arginine (21.33 %), Histidine (15 %), Aspartic acid (12.7 %) and Glutamic acid (9.69 %). SPI exhibited higher solubility and antioxidant activity at pH 7 (47.55 and 87.23 %) when measured by DPPH and ABTS methods respectively. SPI and Zn have the ability to mitigate the effects of MTX on body weight loss. SA/PVA/ZnNPs and SA/PVA/ZnNPs/SPI scaffolds have potential liver protection by down-regulating liver functions (34.83 ± 1.17 U/L and 27.83 ± 1.08 U/L, respectively for ALT and 53.00 ± 1.15 U/L and 48.29 ± 1.29 U/L, respectively for AST) and oxidative and inflammatory markers (MDA, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α) and up-regulating liver antioxidant enzymes (GPx and SOD). Furthermore, the immune-enhancing effects of SA/PVA/ZnNPs and SA/PVA/ZnNPs/SPI scaffolds were demonstrated by the reduction in INF-γ (33.17 ± 0.94 pg/mL and 27.73 ± 0.68 pg/mL, respectively) and CD "
"Abstract: Acne vulgaris is a common chronic inflammatory skin condition, often caused by C. acnes infection. While ZnO has shown promise as an antibacterial agent in acne treatment, concerns over toxicity and non-selective bacterial killing remain. In this study we developed a hyaluronic acid-stabilized nano‑zinc oxide (HA-ZnO) formulation aimed at enhancing the therapeutic efficacy and safety of ZnO for acne treatment. HA-ZnO was synthesized through biomimetic mineralization. HA-ZnO targeted acne-prone areas, especially sebaceous glands, without skin penetration. HA-ZnO demonstrated selective antibacterial activity against C. acnes, exhibiting a killing efficacy more than 16 times greater than that against S. epidermidis. The HA coating also improved ZnO's stability in acidic conditions, mitigating potential toxicity and side effects. Additionally, the sustained release of Zn "

The filler ntTiO₂/ATAB was added at 1, 2.5, and 5 wt% (G RESULTS: Analytical techniques, including TEM, FTIR, UV-Vis, and micro-Raman spectroscopy, confirmed the structure and chemical composition of the ntTiO₂/ATAB. A DC% over 60 % was observed for all groups, with no adverse impact on radiopacity or softening in solvent. Antibacterial testing indicated that increasing ntTiO₂/ATAB concentration led to reduced colony-forming units of critical microorganisms, with this effect sustained over a one-year aging period. Mineral deposition tests showed enhanced phosphate presence over the samples with higher ntTiO₂/ATAB concentrations. There were no statistical differences in human cell viability among groups. SIGNIFICANCE: The dental adhesives formulated with ntTiO "
"Abstract: Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the discovery of greener solvents for industrial applications. In this context, deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as promising candidates across various sectors, including biomass conversion, paper and pulp, pharmaceuticals, and textiles. A new class of DESs, known as natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs), is derived from natural chemicals and is expected to be more environmentally friendly. However, research into the environmental impact and toxicity of NADESs is still limited. Given the broad applications of DESs and the urgent need for sustainable alternatives, studying their toxicity is crucial. In our current study, we focused on NADESs formulated from menthol, thymol, and amino acid. We assessed their toxicity on different cell lines using standard biochemical assays. Remarkably, our findings also indicate that these NADESs exhibit low toxicity in the HaCaT cell line and a mice blood sample. We also found that all of the tested NADESs have shown better antimicrobial property values compared to the individual components of NADESs, indicating the importance of NADES formulation for applications. Among the tested NADESs, menthol:thymol (1:1) showed the best antibacterial properties. These results hold significant implications for the development of NADESs in industrial applications, suggesting a path forward for the adoption of greener and safer solvents. "
"Abstract: Since olden days, medicinal and aromatic plants have been consumed due to their well-known therapeutic, ornamental, culinary, and cosmetic properties. Plant-based cosmetics comprise a growing market offering brands of sustainable products with the ultimate goal of responding to the woman needs to boost their natural beauty, such as soothing, toning, moisturizing and protecting skin and hair. The increasing focus on body and beauty care, combined with a better understanding of the diverse biological effects of plants and their derivatives, has revitalized their significance in aesthetic, cosmetic, and dermatological contexts. Concurrently, the increasing prevalence of allergies and hypersensitivity reactions to synthetic additives commonly found in cosmetics and other skin products has spurred interest in seeking healthier and more efficacious natural alternatives. An intense investigation has been stated around the formulation of medicinal plants- and other plant-based cosmetic products for dermatological and aesthetic purposes. Similarly, a raising awareness by cosmetics' manufacturers and related industries have been progressively stated, culminating with the emergence of a line of plant-based cosmetics increasingly safe and with reliable quality features for multiple purposes. Although a high demand for natural-based products for cosmetic purposes has been stated, further studies are required to deepening knowledge on their beneficial properties, safety and quality features and to identify the main limitations and likelihood of side effects occurrence. In this review, an outlook of the current scenario regarding the use of medicinal and aromatic plants as cosmetic ingredients in the formulation of skin care and other dermatological products traditionally used by the Mediterranean woman for prevention and even cure of skin and hair diseases or for beautification is provided.

"BACKGROUND: The management of papulopustular rosacea presents a significant clinical challenge. Anti-inflammatory and vasoconstrictive treatments are ineffective in the rapid amelioration of the dryness, burning, and itching caused by skin barrier damage in patients with papulopustular rosacea. AIMS: To assess the efficacy and safety of the topical application of compound heparin sodium allantoin gel to treat rosacea. METHODS: Eighty-two patients participated in this randomized, prospective, single-center, and controlled trial. The Clinician Erythema Assessment score, Investigator Global Assessment score, transepidermal water loss, and skin hydration were evaluated at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Rosacea-specific quality of life score, itching, dryness, burning, Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale, and Patient Self-Assessment grades were also assessed. RESULTS: Compared with the traditional therapy group, the 8-week and 12-week topical application of compound heparin sodium allantoin gel to treat rosacea significantly decreased Clinician Erythema Assessment/Investigator Global Assessment grades, burning and itching grades, and rosacea-specific quality of life scores. Compound heparin sodium allantoin gel significantly improved the skin barrier with hydration and significantly decreased trans-epidermal water loss. For patients with Demodex infestation, externally applied compound heparin sodium allantoin gel was associated with better rosacea treatment outcomes and improved skin barrier function than externally applied hyaluronic acid. This may be attributable to the inhibition of abnormal demodex, improved skin barrier, and repair of minor skin wounds. CONCLUSIONS: Compound heparin sodium allantoin gel effectively improved facial erythema, alleviated ithching and burning sensations, and improved patients' quality of life.

"Abstract: Psoriasis has been a rising concern for over a decade, imposing significant challenges to individuals and society. Traditional topical therapy is non-targeted and acts systemically, with associated side effects. This increases the global burden both socially and economically. This review covers the evolution of drug molecules and nanotechnology-based approaches for the topical treatment of psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disorder with no known etiology. Nanotechnology-based approaches offer promising solutions by reducing side effects, providing targeted delivery, protecting drug molecules from degradation, enhancing skin retention, and providing controlled release. Researchers have investigated the incorporation of various conventional and non-conventional therapeutic agents into nanocarriers for psoriasis treatment. The current understanding of the disease and its treatment using various therapeutic agents combined with novel formulation strategies will reduce the duration of treatment and improve the quality of life in psoriatic disease conditions.

"BACKGROUND: Wound healing is essential for restoring skin integrity following damage. The skin barrier plays a critical role in protecting against infection, preventing moisture loss, and supporting regeneration. Ceramides, integral components of the lipid matrix, are known to improve skin hydration, reduce inflammation, and accelerate wound healing. However, research on ceramide-based formulations in post-procedural settings remains limited. AIMS: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of Aestura ATOBARRIER 365 Cream, containing a Lipid Complex with ceramides, cholesterol, and fatty acids, in promoting skin barrier recovery and improving outcomes after barrier disruption. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, split-face trial was conducted with 30 participants aged 22-60 years. Following microneedling, the active formulation was applied to one side of the face and the vehicle formulation to the other, twice daily for 4 weeks. Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL), erythema, and roughness were measured at baseline, post-application, and at weeks 2 and 4. Participant surveys assessed moisturization, erythema, and overall skin improvement. RESULTS: Both formulations demonstrated significant reductions in TEWL (14%-16%) and erythema (~1.7%) by week 4 compared to post-microneedling. High participant satisfaction was also observed, with 93% reporting improved adequate skin hydration and 90% reporting reduced erythema with the active formulation. CONCLUSIONS: Aestura ATOBARRIER 365 Cream with ceramides demonstrated efficacy in improving skin barrier recovery, reducing TEWL, and enhancing skin texture following microneedling. The significant reductions in TEWL, erythema, and roughness highlight its ability to restore the skin's barrier, calm irritation, and refine texture. These findings confirm its role in supporting skin recovery and resilience after dermatological treatments, making it a valuable addition to post-procedure care. While these results support its effectiveness in post-procedural recovery, further research is needed to determine its applicability for other conditions involving compromised skin barriers, such as eczema or rosacea. Additional studies are also warranted to assess long-term efficacy and its potential role in optimizing skin barrier restoration across diverse patient populations. "
"Abstract: This article reviews epidermal barrier dysfunctions and more thoroughly discusses the stratum corneum (SC) permeability barrier, physiologic self-repair mechanisms in healthy skin, and the clinical and structural effects of an overstressed SC permeability barrier. Discussion includes epidermal barrier impairments induced by both exogenous exposures and endogenous factors such as specific dermatologic disorders. Due the plethora of skin care products on the market and the variability of their contents and vehicle formulations, this article addresses core concepts required to optimize skin care product selection, including for specific disease states such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, acne vulgaris, and rosacea. To summarize, the selection of skin care products is directed at maintaining SC hydration, including assisting the SC in self-repair when conditions are adverse. This approach optimizes the ability to sustain healthy skin structure, function and appearance. "

CONCLUSIONS: The data show that TASG is a safe and effective therapeutic option for improving the appearance of acne scars and related hyperpigmentation. "
"Abstract: Coronary artery blockage, the most common cardiovascular problem, is often treated with drug-eluting stents (DES). This study aims to address the main limitation of traditional angioplasty therapy. Thus, designing, fabricating, and analyzing a novel drug-eluting polymeric stent using liquid crystal display (LCD) technology may potentially represent an innovative approach to DES in the near future. Therefore, a poly (lactic acid) (PLA) based 3D-printed stent was designed using SolidWorks software and fabricated using the liquid crystal display (LCD) method. The cyclosporine-loaded stent was prepared and analyzed using optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Loading efficiency percentage and release characteristics were estimated. The polymeric stent platform was successfully designed and manufactured using PLA resin. Based on the characterization of cyclosporine eluting stent, a loading efficiency of 48.66 ± 5.92% was estimated through the immersion method. The FTIR and DSC results confirmed molecular interactions between cyclosporine and the PLA-based 3D-printed stent compared with physical mixture formulations. A sustained release profile of cyclosporine was also observed where approximately 50% of the drug was released within the first three hours. The sustained-release profile, characterized by the absence of a burst release, holds significant clinical potential by ensuring consistent therapeutic levels, reducing side effects, and potentially improving patient outcomes. Overall, the study highlights the effectiveness of LCD technology in printing the stent platform using PLA resin. The results demonstrated a significant cyclosporine loading with a sustained release profile without any stent coating procedure. "
"BACKGROUND: Histological alterations such as nuclear abnormalities are sensitive biomarkers associated with diseases, tissue injury and environmental insults. While visual inspection and human interpretation of histology images are useful for initial characterization, such low-throughput procedures suffer from inherent limitations in terms of reliability, objectivity and reproducibility. Artificial intelligence and digital morphometry offer unprecedented opportunities to quickly and accurately assess nuclear morphotypes in relation to tissue damage including skin injury. METHODS: In this work, we designed NoxiScore, a pipeline providing an integrated, deep learning-based software solution for fully automated and quantitative analysis of nucleus-related features in histological sections of human skin biopsies. We used this pipeline to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three dermato-cosmetic products massively sold at the time of the study in the Montpellier area (South of France): a sunscreen containing UV filters, a mosquito repellent (with synthetic active ingredient IR3535) and a product combining a natural insect repellent plus a sunscreen. Hematoxylin and eosin or hematoxylin-eosin saffron staining was performed to assess skin structure before morphometric parameter computation. RESULTS: We report the identification of a specific nuclear feature based on variation in texture information that can be used to assess skin tissue damage after oxidative stress or UV exposure. Our data show that application of the commercial sun cream provided efficient protection against UV effects in our ex vivo skin model, whereas application of the mosquito repellent as a single product exerted no protective or toxic effect. Notably, we found that concurrent application of the insect repellent with the sunscreen significantly decreased the UVB protective effect of the sunscreen. Last, histometric analysis of human skin biopsies from multiple donors indicates that the sunscreen-insect repellent combo displayed variable levels of protection against UV irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, our study is the first to evaluate the potential toxicity of combining real-life sunscreen and insect repellent products using ex vivo human skin samples, which most closely imitate the cutaneous physiology. The NoxiScore wet-plus-dry methodology has the potential to provide information about the pharmaco-toxicological profile of topically applied formulations and may also be useful for diagnostic purposes and evaluation of the skin exposome including pesticide exposure, air pollution and water contaminants.

"Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising approach for treating infections caused by antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. This case report discusses the successful use of PDT in conjunction with antibiotics to treat a persistent scalp abscess in a patient. After multiple failed antibiotic treatments, PDT was introduced, resulting in significant improvement and eventual resolution of the infection. PDT was performed using a formulation of methylene blue in an oily base at 0.05%, applied intralesionally with an 18G cannula and also topically, followed by exposure to red LED light at 50 J/cm². The treatment resulted in the resolution of the infection after two sessions. This case highlights the potential of PDT as an adjunctive therapy in managing complex skin infections, reducing persistent inflammation, and combating bacterial resistance. Additionally, PDT is suggested as a preventive measure in the immediate postoperative period to avoid late complications that might require antibiotics, thereby reducing the risk of developing microbial resistance. Future studies should explore photosensitizers that do not cause skin staining, as can occur with methylene blue, particularly on the face. "
"Abstract: The rising demand for skin-lightening products has brought glutathione, a tripeptide with antioxidant properties and melanogenesis-regulating effects, into focus as a potentially safer alternative to conventional agents. This narrative review aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral, topical, and intravenous glutathione in skin-lightening therapies. Oral administration shows significant but variable decreases in melanin levels with limited side effects. Topical formulations provide good-level melanin reduction and skin texture improvement but with varying sustainability. Intravenous glutathione, although having rapid action, is associated with serious safety concerns like anaphylaxis and hepatotoxicity, further aggravated by a lack of standardized dosing protocols. Current evidence supports glutathione's potential as a depigmenting agent but underscores the need for rigorous, large-scale clinical trials to establish long-term safety, optimal dosing, and standardized applications. Until such data are available, clinicians and consumers should exercise caution to ensure safe and effective dermatological practices, particularly with intravenous use. "

"OBJECTIVE: To develop a sunscreen formula with spectral selectivity that filters harmful light (280-550 nm) while allowing beneficial light (550-760 nm) to permeate and thus to boost collagen generation. METHODS: A variety of sunscreen filters and their combinations were tested for transmittance spectrum. The spectral selectivity was quantified by Selection Index (SI), and the optimal formula was identified. Then, human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) were subjected to simulated sunlight exposure with the application of this formula. The cell viability and collagen levels were measured post-exposure. RESULTS: The combination of TiO CONCLUSION: This work uncovers the influence of spectral selectivity on the enhancement of sunscreen performance and proposes a filter combination with spectral selectivity. This formula, when integrated with conventional UV sunscreens, allows for the beneficial effects of sunlight to be more pronounced. This discovery may provide fresh insights for the design of future sunscreen products. "
"BACKGROUND: Skin hyperpigmentation is a dermatological concern for pigmented skin phototypes. Despite availability of multiple treatment options, hyperpigmentation management continues to be a challenge. AIMS: Efficacy and safety assessment of the skincare regimen [topical formulation of trihydroxybenzoic acid glucoside 10% (THBG) and α-arbutin 2% (twice-daily) + sunscreen (once daily)] in Indian females with pigmentary spots (facial dark spots or melasma). METHODS: This prospective, open-label, single-arm, interventional study was conducted in Indian females (n = 124), aged 18-45 years, having FitzPatrick skin type III-IV, dull skin, and facial dark spots or melasma. Efficacy of 90-day skincare regimen was evaluated using mexameter, modified melasma area and severity index (mMASI) score, cross-polarized light photography, chromameter, and color-luminosity-brightness-transparency (CLBT) technique. Student's t-test (paired data) was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In efficacy analysis [modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population], 120 subjects were included. Melanin content of pigmentary spots (on mexametry) significantly reduced (-16.3%, p < 0.001) at Day 90 versus baseline. Significant reduction in severity of melasma was observed (-18.4% in mMASI score) at Day 90. Significant improvement in ΔEab (-8.7%) (change in color difference between pigmentary spot and normal skin) on cross-polarized photographs, in skin-brightening parameters L* (relative brightness/lightness) (-2.7%), ITA° (individual typology angle) (-37.7%), and ΔE* (skin-tone evenness) (-19.0%) using chromameter. Significant improvement in skin radiance was observed in CLBT parameters, color (pink: 32.8%, yellow: -5.5%, and olive: -7.8%), luminosity (6.0%), brightness (4.6%), and transparency (0.2%). Regimen did not cause itching, burning, or irritation. CONCLUSIONS: Skincare regime of 10% THBG and 2% α-arbutin along with sunscreen was effective in reducing pigmentary spots (dark spots and melasma) and was well tolerated in Indian women.

"Abstract: Cyclosporine A is an immunosuppressive drug used in clinics to treat steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis (UC). However, due to its side effects, researchers are evaluating novel drug delivery-based treatment options. Nanoparticles-based cyclosporine (Nano-CSA) offers a promising option for the treatment of UC, and various in vivo studies on animals have been conducted. This meta-analysis was performed to clarify the effects of using Nano-CSA based formulations in the mouse UC model. A systemic literature search was conducted on five different electronic databases (ScienceDirect, PubMed, Embase, PMC, and Cochrane) to search studies conducted between the timeline of 2016 and 2024. The search terms include ""nanoparticles,"" ""ulcerative colitis,"" and ""cyclosporine A."" The primary outcomes include histological scores and colon length. The Nano-CSA effects on UC were assessed by analyzing the difference between the treatment and untreated control groups, through the use of standardized mean difference (SMD). A fixed effect model was used where heterogeneity was less than 50%, for higher heterogeneity random effect model was used. The total number of included studies for this systematic review was six, from which meta-analysis was performed on four studies. In all the studies, dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) was used to induce UC, except for one study that used TNBS (2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid) for UC induction. Four studies measured histological score and colon length, and two studies measured other secondary outcomes (IL-6, TNF-α, and MPO (myeloperoxidase activity)). Meta-analysis results have demonstrated that there is an increase in colon length with SMD of 6.879 and a decrease in histological score with SMD of 10.956 in the Nano-CSA treated group. There was also a decrease in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α and IL-6 in the Nano-CSA treated group and no significant difference in MPO activity of the two groups. Colon length, MPO activity, and TNF-α expression demonstrated heterogeneity values of 84.638, 86.113, and 51.567 respectively. The results of this meta-analysis have demonstrated the potential therapeutic efficiency of Nano-CSA for the treatment of UC in mice models. Further research is required in order to explore nano-based novel therapeutics options for UC treatment in other models as well as with human applications. "
"Abstract: Hyperpigmentation is a common dermatological condition characterized by the darkening of patches of skin compared to the surrounding areas. It can occur in individuals of all skin types and ethnicities, and is caused by an overproduction or accumulation of melanin, the pigment responsible for the color of our skin, hair, and eyes. This comprehensive overview aims to delve into the various types, causes, risk factors, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment options for hyperpigmentation.

"Abstract: Psoriasis, a chronic autoimmune and non-communicable skin disease, affects 2-3% of the global population, creating a significant financial burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Treatment approaches are categorized based on disease severity, with first-line therapy focusing on topical treatments and second-line therapy encompassing phototherapy, systemic therapy, and biological therapy. Transdermal drug delivery methods present a promising alternative by enhancing drug absorption through the skin, potentially improving therapeutic outcomes while minimizing systemic adverse effects. Among these, microneedles (MNs) emerge as an innovative transdermal delivery device offering controlled and sustained drug release, reduced systemic exposure, and painless, minimally invasive targeted drug delivery, making them highly suitable for managing skin-related immune disorders. Other transdermal techniques, such as sonophoresis, patches, iontophoresis, and electroporation, also play critical roles in psoriasis treatment. Nanotechnological approaches offer transformative solutions to overcome the limitations of traditional formulations by enhancing efficacy, reducing dosing frequency, and minimizing dose-dependent side effects. Various nanocarriers, including liposomes, ethosomes, transferosomes, niosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), liquid crystalline nanoparticles (LCNPs), nanoemulsions (NEs), and micelles, demonstrate significant potential to improve drug penetration, targeted distribution, safety, and efficacy. This review aims to comprehensively analyze the advancements in nanotechnological approaches and nanocarrier applications for psoriasis management. It discusses the types, pathophysiology, and history of psoriasis while exploring current treatment strategies, including herbal formulations and nanotechnology-based interventions. The review also evaluates the potential of nanotechnological advancements as innovative therapeutic options, emphasizing their mechanisms, benefits, and clinical applicability in addressing the shortcomings of conventional therapies. Together, these insights highlight nano-formulations as a promising frontier for effective psoriasis management. "
"BACKGROUND: Alopecia is globally known as a distressing medical disorder that affects men and women, and current commercially available minoxidil solutions are formulated with irritant vehicles with frequent complaints of dermatologic adverse effects. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate further the compatibility of ready-to-use vehicles for the preparation of tailored formulations for alopecia treatment, namely TrichoSol™ (a ready-to-use vehicle for personalized hair solutions) and TrichoFoam™ (a ready-to-use vehicle for personalized foam formulations), in combination with minoxidil and other active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), to establish adequate beyond-use dates (BUD) for the given formulations. METHODS: Products under evaluation were compounded using TrichoSol™ or TrichoFoam™, with direct incorporation of the APIs into these vehicles. Samples were then stored at controlled room temperature for up to 180 days. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods were developed and validated, and then utilized to evaluate the compatibility of the APIs in TrichoSol™ and TrichoFoam™. Forced degradation studies were conducted to assess API stability under various stress conditions, and Antimicrobial Effectiveness Testing (AET) was performed at 0 and 180 days after compounding. RESULTS: According to our results, BUDs of up to 90-180 days were obtained for the examined formulations stored at room temperature, considering a degradation of maximum 10% of the nominal concentration of the APIs within them. The formulations exhibited no discernible physical alterations throughout this period and maintained chemical stability within acceptable limits. Microbiological evaluations confirmed the efficacy of the preservative system. CONCLUSION: Products compounded with TrichoSol™ and TrichoFoam™ showed suitable stability to be used as personalized treatments for alopecia. We can then suggest that the vehicles TrichoSol™ and TrichoFoam™ present effective solutions for compounding personalized hair care treatments. "
"Abstract: Compared to conventional nanocarrier-based drug delivery technology, small-molecule-assembled nanomaterials provide various advantages, including higher drug loading efficiency, lower excipient-related toxicity, and a simpler formulation process. Our research constructed a mannonse-modified small-molecule-assembled nanodrug for synergistic photodynamic/chemotherapy against A549 cancer cells. The hydrophobic hypoxic-activated agent tirapazamine (TPZ) and a hydrophilic fluorescence probe Cyanine 3 (Cy3) constitute this amphiphilic prodrug via a glutathione (GSH)-responsive linkage, which could self-assemble into stable nanoparticles (NPs) and encapsulate a newly synthesized photosensitizer (SeBDP). To enhance the tumor targeting capability, we introduced a tumor-targeted nanodrug SeBDP@TPZ-S-S-Cy/Man NPs by co-assembling mannose-modified lipid (DSPE-PEG-Man). The GSH-responsive linkage of TPZ-S-S-Cy can be rapidly cleaved by GSH to release the therapeutic agents and fluorescent molecule. The released SeBDP generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) to specifically kill cancer cells and elevate hypoxia, thereby enhancing the cytotoxicity of TPZ. SeBDP@TPZ-S-S-Cy/Man NPs exhibited high selectivity and efficiency for in vivo combination therapy without adverse effects to normal tissues. Our findings demonstrate that SeBDP@TPZ-S-S-Cy/Man NPs have great potential for enhancing cancer treatment both in vitro and in vivo by combining an oxygen depletion prodrug with a hypoxia-activated antitumor agent. Thus, the GSH-sensitive self-assembled nanodrug from an amphiphilic hypoxia-activated prodrug, could serve as a potential drug carrier in targeted synergistic cancer therapy. "
"Abstract: Alopecia, a common dermatological condition, poses significant psychological and social challenges. Despite the availability of various treatments, their efficacy is often limited by poor bioavailability and delivery challenges. Nanostructured lipid carriers have emerged as promising advanced drug delivery systems for alopecia treatment due to their ability to encapsulate both hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds, enhancing their stability, solubility, and controlled release. This manuscript explores the potential of Nanostructured lipid carriers as innovative delivery platforms for alopecia therapeutics, focusing on their formulation, characterization, and application in topical treatments. The unique properties of Nanostructured lipid carriers, including their small size, biocompatibility, and ability to target specific skin layers, are discussed in relation to improving the penetration and therapeutic efficacy of active ingredients such as minoxidil, finasteride, and plant-derived compounds. Additionally, we highlight the role of Nanostructured lipid carriers in improving scalp penetration, reducing side effects, and offering a more efficient alternative to conventional treatments. The manuscript concludes with insights into future trends, challenges, and the clinical potential of Nanostructured lipid carriers-based formulations in revolutionizing alopecia treatment. "

"Abstract: Iodoform, a halogenated organic compound, has been a cornerstone in surgical practice due to its potent antiseptic and antimicrobial properties. This comprehensive review examines the historical evolution, mechanism of action, clinical applications, and safety profile of iodoform across various surgical disciplines. Historically significant formulations like Whitehead's varnish and bismuth iodoform paraffin paste (BIPP) demonstrated remarkable efficacy in wound healing during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. BIPP, extensively used for cavity packing, combines bismuth subnitrate for its antibacterial and astringent effects with paraffin to minimize tissue trauma. The antimicrobial action of iodoform is attributed to the release of iodine upon activation by free radicals, leading to the denaturation of bacterial proteins and cytotoxic effects on inflammatory cells, thereby enhancing therapeutic efficacy. Clinically, iodoform has diverse applications in ear, nose, and throat surgery, neurosurgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and general dental practice. It is utilized for dressing wounds, packing surgical cavities, and managing conditions such as nasal fractures, epistaxis, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, and dry sockets. The radiopacity of BIPP, due to its bismuth content, aids in radiographic identification but necessitates clear communication with radiologists to prevent misinterpretation. Despite its benefits, iodoform use is associated with potential complications. Bismuth and iodoform toxicities, though rare, can lead to neurotoxicity and systemic symptoms, requiring prompt recognition and intervention. Allergic reactions, particularly in patients with prior exposure, and dermatological side effects like dermatitis herpetiformis flare-ups have been documented. Mechanical complications and considerations during pregnancy, owing to the potential transfer of iodine to the fetus, highlight the need for cautious application. This review underscores the enduring significance of iodoform in surgical settings while emphasizing the importance of awareness regarding its potential risks. Careful clinical judgment and ongoing research are imperative to optimize its therapeutic benefits and enhance patient safety. "
"Abstract: Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide, with exposure to UVB radiation being a significant risk factor for its development. To prevent skin cancer, continuous research efforts have focused on finding suitable photoprotective ingredients from natural sources that are also environmentally friendly. This study aimed to develop oil-in-water photoprotective nanoemulsions containing marine macroalgae extract. A Box-Behnken experimental design was used to identify the most promising formulation composition, resulting in optimal physical properties. These properties, including droplet size, polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta potential, were evaluated using dynamic light scattering (DLS). To assess the photoprotection capacity of the formulations, electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to evaluate alterations in the electrical characteristics of excised pig skin membranes placed in Franz cells equipped with a 4-electrode set-up. The final composition of the nanoemulsion was caprylic/capric triglycerides 4%, Macrogolglycerol ricinoleate 30%, and algae extract 1%. The nanoemulsions had an average droplet size of 128.5 ± 8.6 nm, a PDI of 0.25 ± 0.06, and a zeta potential of 45.14 ± 0.02 mV. Compared to the control group, the photoprotective capacity of the oil-in-water nanoemulsions was statistically significant. Specifically, only a 15% reduction in the skin membrane electrical resistance following UVB exposure was observed when the formulation containing algae extract was used, whereas a 50% reduction was observed for the vehicle. In conclusion, this work demonstrates that the developed nanoemulsions based on natural ingredients show promising protective capacity against UVB exposure of the skin. "
"PURPOSE: Dimethyl fumarate (DMF), the first-line oral therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, is rapidly metabolized into monomethyl fumarate. The DMF oral administration provokes gastrointestinal discomfort causing treatment withdrawal. The present study aimed to develop an innovative formulation for DMF nasal administration. Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs) were developed to improve DMF stability, limiting gastrointestinal side effects and increasing brain bioavailability by nose-to-brain targeting application. METHODS: DMF-loaded and unloaded LPNs with or without hyaluronic acid (HA) were prepared using the nanoprecipitation via magnetic/mechanical stirring technique. Particle morphology and surface properties were evaluated; drug content, viscosity, and mucoadhesion were determined. Physico-chemical stability of LPNs and DMF in the LPNs was also explored. In vitro DMF permeation experiments were performed utilizing the PermeaPad RESULTS: LPNs with average sizes of 120-250 nm and a negative zeta potential -17.3 to -43 mV were obtained, primarily influenced by the presence of HA. HA assured drug stability up to 60 days and promoting the in vitro permeation of DMF compared to the free-DMF. HA greatly improved the viscosity and mucoadhesive properties. LPNs with and without HA did not exhibit any cytotoxicity and showed a rapid cell uptake starting from 15 min to 2 h with a best internalization after 1 h of treatment in both epithelial and neuronal cell lines. Nasal administration of DMF-loaded LPNs allowed to quantify up to about 12 μg/mL of DMF in the rat cerebrospinal fluid. CONCLUSION: The results highlight the role of HA in improving LPNs properties and performance as carrier of DMF for nasal administration. In particular, LPNs appear able to enter neurons and monolayers of epithelial cells, allowing to promote the nose-to-brain DMF delivery. "

"Abstract: Chemotherapeutic agents are widely used to combat breast cancer. However, due to their non-selective biodistribution, their usage is associated with severe adverse effects on healthy tissues. In this study, a chitosan-stabilized nanoemulsion (CSNE) was prepared for the codelivery of curcumin (CUR) and methotrexate (MTX). The mean diameter and polydispersity index of CUR-MTX-CSNEs were 194.63 ± 6.7 nm and 0.27 ± 0.06, respectively. Modifying the nanoemulsion surface with chitosan decreased the drug release at pH 7.4 compared to pH 5.8. The MTT test demonstrated that CUR-MTX-CSNEs were more successful in reducing the cell viability of 4T1 cells than both bare formulation and free drugs. Moreover, compared to the free drug-treated group, a 2.6 times reduction of the relative tumor volume was witnessed in CUR-MTX-CSNEs-receiving mice. Histopathological studies confirmed a more substantial inhibitory effect on tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis of developed nanostructures than free CUR/MTX. While there was no noticeable toxicity in the vital organs of CUR-MTX-CSNEs-receiving mice, free drugs resulted in severe toxicity in the liver, kidney, lung and spleen. Overall, the pH-dependent drug release, improved anti-tumor activity and reduced organ toxicity suggest that CUR-MTX-CSNE may be promising in breast cancer therapy. "
"BACKGROUND: Developing carrier-free nanomedicines via self-assembly of two antitumor drug molecules is a potential strategy for enhancing the combination treatment of tumors. Similarly, conventional chemotherapy combined with photodynamic therapy may synergistically improve the antitumor effect while minimizing the adverse reactions associated with antitumor treatment. Hyaluronic acid (HA) can bind to overexpressed HA receptors on the tumor cell surface, increasing cell internalization and resulting in good tumor-targeting properties. METHODS: Herein, we propose an easy and environmentally friendly approach for fabricating a novel formulation of carrier-free pure nanodrugs through self-assembly of the antitumor drug doxorubicin (DOX) and the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6), followed by sequential modification with HA to achieve simultaneous and targeted photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy. RESULTS: The fabricated HA-DOX-Ce6 nanoparticles (NPs) exhibited enhanced drug loading and stability while possessing the properties of near-infrared fluorescence imaging, self-targeting drug delivery, and combined photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: HA-DOX-Ce6 NPs, along with laser irradiation, effectively suppressed tumor development both in vitro and in vivo with minimal side effects. Overall, this biomaterial-based, carrier-free drug delivery system, in combination with cotargeted therapies, has shown potential for considerable improvements in treatment outcomes and patient prognosis.

"Abstract: The review aims to assess the potential of niosomes-nonionic surfactant-based vesicular systems-as carriers for topical and transdermal drug delivery. Niosomes enable targeted and controlled drug release while minimizing systemic toxicity. The investigation centers on their structure, stability, and capacity to entrap both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs, as well as their use in managing various dermatological and systemic disorders. Recent studies have examined the formulation of niosomes, particularly highlighting the roles of nonionic surfactants and cholesterol in enhancing the stability and entrapment efficiency of these vesicles. Research on permeability enhancers has been reviewed for their ability to work together to improve drug transport and bioavailability. It also provides a detailed discussion on the use of niosomes in treating various dermatological conditions, as well as their applications in systemic diseases, with a particular focus on co-delivery systems in cancer therapies. Niosomes exhibit efficacy in drug delivery by providing an increase in penetration through the stratum corneum, targeting hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs for dermatological and systemic applications. The Development of niosomal therapy has expanded into immunization, antiinflammatory treatments, and the control of pigmentation. Permeability enhancers further increase their efficacy, bioavailability, and tissue localization. Anticancer treatment using niosomes for codelivery of agents demonstrates synergistic effects with reduced side effects. Niosomes have tremendous potential in advancing topical and transdermal drug delivery, offering controlled, targeted release and improved patient outcomes. With optimized fabrication and comprehensive toxicity evaluation, niosomes can potentially revolutionize topical therapies, making them safer, more effective, and patient-friendly for a range of next-generation treatment options across dermatology and beyond.

"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Mangifera indica (family Anacardiaceae), often acknowledged as mango and renowned for being a plant of diverse ethnopharmacological background since ancient times, harbors the polyphenolic bioactive constituent, mangiferin (MNG). MNG is a major phytochemical of Mangifera indica and other plants with a wide range of reported pharmacological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and hepatoprotective effects. MNG has also been utilized in traditional medicine; it is reportedly a major bioactive element in over 40 polyherbal products in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and two prominent anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and antiviral Cuban formulations. Despite the availability of evidence in support of MNG hepatoprotective properties, its hepatoprotective potential against MTX-induced liver injury and fibrosis has not been explored yet. AIM: To unravel the hepatoprotective potential of MNG against MTX-induced hepatic injury and fibrosis and elucidate the possible underlying molecular mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were, randomly, distributed into five groups; two of which were administered MNG 50 mg/kg and MNG 100 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) for ten days, and a single i.p. injection of MTX 40 mg/kg on the seventh day to establish hepatotoxicity. Blood and liver tissue samples were retrieved from all study groups and analyzed for liver functions, histopathological alterations, and oxidative stress, inflammatory, and fibrotic biomarkers. RESULTS: MNG restored the MTX-induced degenerations in hepatic architecture and function. Moreover, it combated the MTX-elicited oxidative stress evidently by the significantly attenuated hepatic tissue levels of malondialdehyde, and the significantly elevated reduced glutathione and Nrf2 levels. MNG also halted inflammation depicted by the downregulation of the NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome axis. It further demonstrated anti-fibrogenic potential as evidenced by the significant reduction in fibrous tissue deposition and hepatic expression of α-SMA. CONCLUSION: The current study proved the hepatoprotective, and anti-fibrogenic effects of MNG against MTX-induced hepatotoxicity via the downregulation of NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling axis, preceded by the amelioration of oxidative stress and Nrf2 signaling upregulation.

"Abstract: Acne vulgaris (AV) is a common dermatological condition that ranges from mild comedones to severe inflammatory nodules and scarring. Effective management is essential for improving patients' quality of life. The recent FDA approval of IDP-126 (Cabtreo™), a novel triple-combination gel, meets these needs by combining clindamycin phosphate, benzoyl peroxide, and adapalene into a single formulation. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and impact of IDP-126 on quality of life in managing AV. The study's goal was to provide clinicians with the necessary information to consider including this medication in acne treatment plans. A total of 281 articles were manually screened, and three studies (n = 388) met the inclusion criteria. Standardized mean differences were used to quantify lesion reductions, while pooled ORs assessed adverse events. Additional references were reviewed to address potential gaps in the reported outcomes. IDP-126 showed significant reductions in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions compared to vehicle treatments and demonstrated favorable numbers needed to treat compared to other topical therapies. It was associated with application site pain and erythema. Notable improvements in quality of life were observed across various domains related to acne severity. IDP-126 is an effective treatment for AV, offering substantial clinical benefits and improving quality of life. While it is associated with higher rates of certain adverse effects, its overall efficacy supports its inclusion in treatment regimens, provided that its safety profile is carefully managed to optimize patient outcomes.

"Abstract: To extend the short half-life of fluorouracil (Fu), enhance its tumor targeting, improve efficacy, and reduce side effects, providing a new approach for colorectal cancer treatment. Fluorouracil was hydroxylated and conjugated with methotrexate to form a 5-fluorouracil-methotrexate conjugate (MF). This was complexed with sulfobutyl ether-β-cyclodextrin (MF-SEBCD) using a stirring method to create an injectable formulation. In vitro studies assessed the conversion of MF-SEBCD in plasma and its antitumor activity. In vivo studies examined antitumor activity, preliminary safety, pharmacokinetics, and tissue distribution. MF was synthesized with a 25% yield and purity above 95%. The water solubility of MF increased by 92-fold with MF-SEBCD preparation. In vitro, MF-SEBCD effectively converted into Fu in plasma and showed strong antitumor activity, with IC50 values of 0.51, 1.29, and 1.26 µM for MC38, HT29, and 4T1 cells, respectively. In vivo, MF-SEBCD achieved a tumor inhibition rate of 57.08%. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that MF-SEBCD extended Fu's half-life to 47 min, nearly double that of Fu injection. Tissue distribution analysis confirmed improved tumor targeting. MF-SEBCD effectively prolongs Fu's half-life, enhances tumor targeting, increases antitumor efficacy, and reduces side effects, offering a promising approach for colorectal cancer treatment. "
"Abstract: Psoriasis is an autoimmune-driven inflammatory skin disease, clinically characterized by skin thickening, erythema, and scaling, significantly impacting patients' life quality and mental health. Clinically, oral pill or injection of methotrexate (MTX) formulation is a common route for psoriasis therapy, while both methods often cause undesired toxicity due to systemic administration, and limit patient compliance because of the frequent-dosing requirement. Here, we introduce a dissolvable microneedle (MN) patch made of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) that incorporates self-assembled hyaluronic acid (HA) nanoparticles (NPs) conjugating MTX, which is designed for treating skin diseases, offering reduced adverse effects and improved patient adherence through its targeted and long-acting properties. Upon transdermal delivery via polymeric MNs, the HA-based therapeutic NPs actively target to the inflammatory skin cells via the interaction of HA group with CD44 protein that is highly expressed on the cell membrane in the psoriatic skin. Moreover, the HA-based NPs undergo slow dissociation, thereby achieving sustained release of the MTX drug at the lesion site over 7 days. Due to the favorite features, in the imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriatic mouse, only one application of the polymeric MN patch achieves diminished epidermal hyperplasia, and reduced inflammatory factors expression, ultimately improving the psoriasis-like skin condition in vivo.

"Abstract: Minoxidil is a vasodilator medication known for its ability to promote hair growth. Although it was first introduced as an oral drug to treat hypertension, minoxidil was observed to have the important side-effect of increasing hair growth. This led to the development of a topical formulation as a 2% concentration solution for the treatment of female androgenic alopecia (AGA) and 5% for treating male AGA, which is considered as a first line U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for AGA in addition to oral 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor (finasteride). The mechanism by which minoxidil promotes hair growth is not fully understood but can be related to increasing blood flow owing to its vasodilator effects. Androgenic alopecia is characterized by the gradual conversion of terminal hairs into vellus hairs. Alterations in the hair cycle include reduced duration of the anagen phase and increased duration of the telogen phase, resulting in shorter hairs and eventual balding. Side effects of topical minoxidil include irritant and allergic contact dermatitis, pruritus, and facial hypertrichosis, which are more often seen with the use of 5% solutions rather than 2%. Herein, we report a 24-year-old woman who developed severe ear and face hypertrichosis after using a topical 5% minoxidil solution. She later had spontaneous resolution of her hypertrichosis three months after stopping it. "
"BACKGROUND: Inorganic ultraviolet filters such as titanium dioxide nanoparticles are frequently used in sunscreens. Numerous toxicological studies in vitro and in vivo have been conducted using pristine standard reference nanomaterials of these inorganic filters. While convenient, this approach is not realistic because the complex environment of sunscreen formulations could change the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles and lead to vastly different toxicological outcomes. Therefore, this study focused on characterizing nanoparticles extracted from commercial sunscreen and evaluating the associated toxicological impacts upon exposure to human keratinocytes and human skin explants. RESULTS: Titanium dioxide nanoparticles were extracted from commercial sunscreens and thoroughly characterized. The identity of the associated molecular corona on the extracted nanoparticles was also evaluated. Cell metabolic and proliferation profiles, mitochondrial superoxide activity, reactive oxygen species levels, and genotoxicity induced through exposure to the nanoparticles were studied in vitro using a human keratinocyte cell line. The cell response was significantly different after treatment with pristine nanoparticles compared to corresponding sunscreen-extracted nanoparticles. Pristine spherical nanoparticles resulted in more pronounced toxicity in 2D cultured keratinocytes compared to extracted nanoparticles but did not impact wound-edge migration significantly in 3D ex vivo human skin explant models. Additionally, extracted rod-shaped nanoparticles had greater toxic impacts in keratinocytes in vitro and retarded wound-edge migration in the ex vivo model compared to the extracted spherical nanoparticles. Nevertheless, these heightened cell responses were not associated with any increase in phosphorylated γH CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the feasibility of extracting nanoparticles from personal care products such as sunscreens to obtain relevant forms to model real-life exposure scenarios. Overall, sunscreen-extracted nanoparticles were found to be less toxic compared to pristine equivalents but retarded wound-edge migration more significantly. Skin explant cultures provide a more realistic alternative to monolayer cell cultures, although the differential outcomes between the models need more in-depth evaluation. "
"BACKGROUND: There are numerous over-the-counter products for treating acne, although many formulations have tolerability issues and lack the cosmetic elegance desired by adult patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a non-prescription, active acne regimen in adult patients of all Fitzpatrick skin types. METHOD: Thirty-five male and female subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types I-VI were enrolled in this single-site, monadic 8-week study. The acne treatment regimen included a clarifying cleanser, balancing serum, and broad-spectrum sunscreen formulated with synergistic ingredients designed to mitigate acne and reduce post-acne sequelae including post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) and post-inflammatory erythema (PIE). RESULTS: After 8 weeks of use, there was a statistically significant reduction in inflammatory lesions by 63%, non-inflammatory lesions by 41% and investigator global assessment by 51%. Additionally, there was significant improvement in tactile smoothness, visual smoothness, skin softness, and luminosity. Post-acne sequelae including PIH and PIE improved significantly by 27%. No tolerability issues were identified by the investigator and subjects gave the regimen an excellent tolerability rating. 78.5% of subjects agreed that, after 8 weeks of product use, their skin appeared more radiant and looked better than before starting the study. CONCLUSION: In this study, a well formulated, cosmetically elegant active acne regimen was found to be highly effective and well tolerated when used by adult acne patients of diverse ethnicities. In addition, the regimen improved cosmetic aspects of the skin including PIH and PIE, which are important when treating adult acne sufferers.

"BACKGROUND: The appearance of dull skin, uneven skin tone, dark spots, and hyperpigmentation is often bothersome, especially in individuals with darker skin tones. Management of skin dyschromia can be difficult. Several topical ingredients, such as niacinamide and vitamin C, are clinically proven to inhibit pigmentation formation and improve overall skin tone. A skincare regimen formulated to minimize irregular melanin deposition levels has been specifically developed to help improve uneven skin tone for a more radiant appearance. This regimen consists of an exfoliating cleanser (EC), an antioxidant C serum (ACS), a day cream with SPF (DC), and a renewing cream (RC). METHODS: A 12-week in-use clinical regimen study was conducted to assess the efficacy, tolerability, and consumer perception of these products on 43 subjects with mild-to-moderate uneven skin tone. Assessments included clinical photography, tolerability, and a self-assessment questionnaire. RESULTS: There was a noticeable improvement in uneven skin tone, as shown in clinical photography across all timepoints (weeks 4, 8, and 12) compared to baseline. The regimen was safe and well tolerated for use and was highly acceptable among the subjects, with 81% of participants agreeing that their skin was more radiant since initiation of the regimen and 76% agreeing that the regimen had helped to significantly reduce the appearance of dark spots after 12 weeks of use. There were no reported adverse events. CONCLUSION: Overall, these data show that this regimen is effective in reducing the appearance of uneven skin tone.

"Abstract: Marine and coastal environments are constantly subjected to increasing pressures associated with population growth, industrialization development, pollution and higher demand feeding society's consumerism. Among these pressures, there has been an increasing concern towards UV filters occurrence in aquatic ecosystems due to a greater use of personal care products (PCPs). 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate (EHMC) is one of the most used UV filters in sunscreen formulations, yet few reports address its effects in biota. This literature review intends to collect the available information concerning the environmental presence of EHMC in marine and coastal ecosystems and their effects in biota. The EHMC effects have been reported for the taxonomic groups: Actinomycetes, Alphaproteobacteria, Bacilli, Cytophagia, Flavobacteriia, Gammaproteobacteria, Actinopterygii, Anthozoa, Bacillariophyceae, Bivalvia, Branchiopoda, Coccolithophyceae, Echinoidea, Gastropoda, Malacostraca, Annelida and Thecostraca. The reported literature evaluated endpoints mainly related to development, viability, mortality, estrogenicity, gene transcription disruptions, biochemical alterations and morphophysiological changes. Based on the available information, there is still a clear need for further investigations related to EHMC and its toxicological effects on marine and coastal organisms. "
"Abstract: Exposure of the skin to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is associated with many pathological conditions such as premature aging and skin cancer. Furthermore, members of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate-oxidase (NADPH oxidase or NOX) enzyme family can produce UV-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), even after cessation of radiation exposure. The caffeic acid-phthalimide (CF) compound is a potent antioxidant, which reduces the generation of ROS. However, its high lipophilicity may hamper its permeation through the skin. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) can ensure close contact and increase the amount of drug absorbed into the skin. The present work aims to develop and optimize SLNs containing CF to achieve enhanced skin photoprotection along with antioxidant and anti-aging effects. SLNs were prepared by the hot homogenization method using Compritol 888 ATO as lipid matrix, and Tween 80 and Pluronic® F-127 as surfactants to stabilize the nanoparticle dispersion. The particles had high stability for at least 30 days. Physicochemical characterizations of the selected SLNs formulations showed sizes in the range 150-180 nm, polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.2, and a negative zeta potential (≅ -25  mV). The SLNs had high CF entrapment efficiency (96-97 %) and showed a controlled drug-release profile. The in vitro study revealed low cytotoxic properties of CF-loaded SLNs towards fibroblasts and a photoprotective effect, reflected from the increased viability of UVB-irradiated fibroblasts treated with CF-SLNs. Moreover, the CF-SLNs induced fibroblast migration and closure, showing that these nanosystems offer not only biological photoprotection, but also stimulate wound healing. "

METHODS: In these randomized, multicenter, double-masked, vehicle-controlled studies patients received ciclosporin 0.1% or vehicle (1:1 ratio) in both eyes twice daily for 85 and 29 days, respectively. Total and central corneal fluorescein staining (tCFS; cCFS; NEI scale, 0-15) were assessed at Day 15 and 29. Other endpoints included conjunctival staining and blurred vision scores. Safety and tolerability parameters comprised adverse events, ophthalmic examinations and drop comfort assessments. RESULTS: In total 1162 patients were included in the analysis (585 ciclosporin 0.1%; 577 vehicle). Patients age (mean [SD]: 58.3 [15.23] years) and gender distribution (73% females) are consistent with DED epidemiology. Change from baseline (LS mean [SE]) in tCFS significantly improved compared to vehicle, both at Day 15 (ciclosporin: -3.24 [0.112]; vehicle -2.71 [0.113]; Δ= -0.52 [0.144], p=0.0003) and Day 29 (ciclosporin: ‑3.83 [0.115]; vehicle:‑3.30 [0.116]; Δ: ‑0.53 [0.147], p=0.0003). 56.8% and 66.4% of patients responded to ciclosporin 0.1% with a tCFS improvement of ≥ 3 scores on Day 15 and 29, respectively. A consistent effect on tCFS favoring ciclosporin over vehicle was observed in all subgroups. Improvements favoring ciclosporin were seen in cCFS and conjunctival staining in the overall population and in blurred vision score in patients with significant corneal staining. Incidence of ocular adverse events was 13.2% in both treatment groups. Mild instillation site reactions were reported by 7.9% patients in the ciclosporin group. Discontinuation rates were low with 2.6% and 2.1% in ciclosporin and vehicle groups. Ciclosporin 0.1% was rated comfortable upon instillation by 84.7% of patients. CONCLUSION: The pooled analysis confirmed that the water-free ciclosporin 0.1% solution is effective in improving ocular surface staining after 2 weeks of treatment to a clinically relevant extent in more than 50% of patients in the overall population and subgroups. With an early onset and good tolerability, the product has the potential to address an unmet medical need in DED. GOV IDENTIFIER:  NCT03292809 on 21-July-2017; NCT04523129 on 20-August-2020 KEY MESSAGES: What Was Known: Ciclosporin eye drops are a standard of care in dry eye disease (DED) therapy not controlled by artificial tears. A novel water-free ciclosporin 0.1% ophthalmic solution with improved efficacy has recently been commercialized in the United States and approved in the European Union. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: The water-free cyclosporine 0.1% solution showed consistent and early improvement of ocular surface damage in patients with moderate and severe dry eye disease as well as in subgroups according to age and sex. Responder analysis showed the clinical relevance of these improvements in more than 50 % of treated patients after 2 weeks of treatments. This eye drop formulation was well tolerated and no new safety signals were detected. "
"Abstract: Traditional tumor treatment faces great challenge owning to inherent drawbacks. Activatable prodrugs with multi-modality therapeutic capacity are highly desired. In this consideration, a responsiveness-released multi-in-one nanoplatform, PLGA-PEG@HC, toward cervical cancer therapy was innovatively developed. Among the nanoplatform, HC was constructed by incorporating chlorambucil, a classic chemotherapy drug into a near-infrared photo- and sono-sensitizer, HCH via ester linker, which can be specifically hydrolyzed by carboxylesterase (CES). HC is scarcely fluorescent and toxic due to the caging of HCH and chlorambucil, thus achieving low background signal and minimal side effects. However, once selectively hydrolyzed by tumor enriched CES, ester bond will be broken. Consequently, HCH and chlorambucil are released so as to achieve near-infrared fluorescence imaging and synergistic photodynamic/sonodynamic/chemo therapy. PLGA-PEG packaging ensures the biocompatibility of HC. The as-obtained nanoplatform, with diameter of 97 nm, achieves tumor targeting capacity via EPR. In vitro and in vivo applications have demonstrated that PLGA-PEG@HC can accumulate in tumor tissues, exhibit CES-activatable near-infrared fluorescence imaging and efficient tumor suppression capacity. Compared with the reported combinational therapy materials which are complex in compositions, PLGA-PEG@HC is simple in formulation but demonstrates near-infrared fluorescence traced and considerable therapy efficacy toward tumors, which may accelerate the clinical translation.

"Abstract: Nano-formulation has generated attention in the battle against cancer, because of its great flexibility, reduced adverse side effects, and accuracy in delivering drugs to target tissues dependent on the size and surface characteristics of the disease. The field of photodynamic treatment has advanced significantly in the past years. Photodynamic techniques that use nano-formulations have surfaced to further the field of nanotechnology in medicine, especially in cancer treatment. The pharmaceutical industry is seeing a growing trend toward enhanced drug formulation using nano-formulations such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, nano-emulsions, and micelles. Natural extracts have also shown adverse effects when employed as photosensitizers in cancer therapy because they are cytotoxic when activated by light. Still, natural photosensitizers are a big part of cancer treatment. However, some shortcomings can be minimized by combining nano-formulations with these natural photosensitizers. The synergistic improvement in medication delivery that maintains or increases the mechanism of cell death in malignant cells has also been demonstrated by the combination of photodynamic therapy with nano-formulations and natural photosensitizers. Lastly, this review assesses the feasibility and potential of a photodynamic therapy system based on nano-formulations and natural photosensitizers in clinical treatment applications and briefly discusses the removal of toxic compounds associated with nano-formulations within cells.

"Abstract: The discovery and use of cyclosporine since its inception into the clinics in the '70s and up have played a crucial role in advancing transplant therapy, and containment of the immune-based rejections. The drug has improved the high rates of acute rejections and has supported early graft survival. However, the long-term survival of renal allografts is still less prevalent, and an in-depth analysis, as well as reported findings led us to believe that there is a chronic irreversible component to the drug, that is tackled through its metabolites, and that causes toxicity, which has led to new therapies, including monoclonal antibody-based medications. A recap of the immunosuppressive effects, and entwined toxicity of the drug, now relegated primarily to bone marrow early transplants, is being overviewed for the past protocols that were used to minimize, and avoid, or use this calcineurin inhibitor class of drug, cyclosporine, in combination with other drugs. The current review circumvents the cyclosporine's mechanism of action, pathophysiology, cytochrome roles, and other factors associated with acute and chronic toxicity developments. The review also attempts to find conclusive strategies reported in the recent studies to avoid its toxic side effects, and develop a safe-use strategy for the drug. Gastrointestinal decontamination, supporting the airway, monitoring for signs of respiratory insufficiency, monitoring for severe reactions, such as seizures, need for administration of oxygen, and avoiding the administration of drugs, that increase the blood levels of the cyclosporine, are beneficial interventions, when encountering cyclosporine toxicity cases. The constrained therapeutic outcomes have also led to redesign, and making use of combined formulations to reassess the pharmacokinetics of the drug. "
"Abstract: Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic skin disorder characterized by painful inflammatory nodules and abscesses, significantly impacting patients' quality of life. Current treatment strategies, including topical antibiotics, often yield limited efficacy and pose risks of antibiotic resistance. Photodynamic therapy has emerged as a potential option, with RLP068/Cl (ELKOFAST®, non-sterile formulation) showing promising efficacy due to its broad-spectrum bactericidal activity. We conducted a pilot study assessing the therapeutic response to photodynamic therapy with RLP068/Cl versus topical clindamycin gel in patients affected by hidradenitis suppurativa of Hurley score I, II, and III. Results revealed higher efficacy of photodynamic therapy in combination with RLP068/Cl, particularly in mild cases. Its efficacy remains reliable even in more severe cases when combined with adalimumab. The observed faster lesion improvement and pain relief were ascribed to the bactericidal effects of RLP068/Cl against Gram "
"Abstract: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder with a complex pathogenesis involving epidermal barrier dysfunction and aberrant lipid composition, particularly ceramides and fatty acids (FA). Conventional management options, such as topical glucocorticoids (GC), often lead to adverse effects upon prolonged usage, prompting the exploration of alternative therapeutic strategies. The lipid extract from Black Soldier Fly larvae (BSFL) biomass, holding a rich blend of FA, holds substantial potential as a novel ingredient to tackle skin barrier impairment. This study aimed to achieve proof-of-concept validation of innovative nanotechnology-based formulations tailored to enhance the topical management of AD. Specifically, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) with BSFL lipid extract were developed to perform both as a carrier for dexamethasone (DEX), a representative GC, and as skin barrier repair adjuvants. Through systematic optimization using Box-Behnken Design, BSFL lipid extract-based SLNs demonstrated favorable physicochemical properties for topical application and satisfactory stability over 2 months. Notably, these SLNs exhibited favorable drug release kinetics, delivering the total DEX payload within a therapeutically relevant timeframe. Furthermore, these nanocarriers showed the ability to permeate human keratinocytes without pronounced toxicity, suggesting their potential utility in enhancing drug delivery and cellular uptake. Overall, these findings suggest that BSFL lipid extract is a promising natural and sustainable ingredient for the development of nanotechnology-driven approaches to AD management, offering a potential avenue for addressing the unmet needs in this challenging dermatologic condition.

"Abstract: Interest has risen in recent years to assess the fate and impacts of organic ultraviolet (UV) filters in aquatic environments, after being recognized as contaminants of emerging concern. Octinoxate, also known as ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC), is among the widely used UV filters in sunscreen formulations. Its potential toxicological effects in aquatic biota have led to precautionary actions in some jurisdictions, such as restricting and even banning its presence in commercial sunscreens. However, research data is lacking for effective regulation of sunscreen ingredients in Mediterranean countries. Our study evaluated the response of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica to EHMC under a short-term experimental setup, recreating summer conditions in aquaria subjected to different environmentally relevant concentrations for the Mediterranean Sea (minimum: 30.57 ng L "
"Abstract: Acne is a multifactorial inflammatory disease with a robust microbial component and numerous correlations with dysbiosis states. Furthermore, various factors are recognized as triggers for skin dysbiosis, including the use of certain cosmetics. Based on these arguments, we hypothesized that using photoprotective formulations could trigger dysbiosis and the occurrence of acne manifestations. To verify this assumption, six volunteers between 19 and 23 years of age, meeting all the inclusion criteria, received two applications a day of a non-commercial sunscreen formulation developed with the sun filters ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, ethylhexyl salicylate, methyl anthranilate, and octocrylene dispersed in a base gel, with an estimated protection factor of 28.8. The pure base gel was used as a control. The samples were applied to an area delimited by a standard template (15 cm "
"INTRODUCTION: Topical clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/adapalene 0.15%/benzoyl peroxide 3.1% (CAB) gel is the only fixed-dose, triple-combination formulation approved for acne treatment. In 3 clinical studies of participants with moderate-to-severe acne, CAB demonstrated superior efficacy to vehicle and component dyads, with good safety and tolerability. Detailed efficacy/safety data from individual clinical study participants are presented. METHODS: In two phase 3 (NCT04214652, NCT04214639) randomized, double-blind, 12-week studies, participants aged at least 9 years with moderate-to-severe acne were randomized to once-daily CAB or vehicle gel. Descriptive data - including lesion count changes, treatment success (at least 2-grade reduction from baseline in Evaluator's Global Severity Score and clear/almost clear skin), compliance, treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), and cutaneous safety/tolerance assessments - were summarized from 6 CAB-treated cases. RESULTS: By week 12, all cases achieved &gt;70% lesion reductions, 4/6 achieved treatment success, and 1/6 achieved a 2-grade reduction in severity. All cases were compliant with CAB treatment. No cases reported serious AEs. Transient increases occurred on cutaneous safety and tolerability assessments, with scores generally decreasing back to/below baseline levels by week 12. CONCLUSIONS: In two phase 3 clinical trials, fixed-dose, triple-combination CAB demonstrated good efficacy/safety. All 6 CAB-treated cases achieved substantial (&gt;70%) lesion reductions, with 5/6 achieving treatment success or 2-grade reduction in severity by week 12. Transient cutaneous safety/tolerability severity increases generally resolved to baseline values by week 12. These clinical study cases reinforce the importance of patient education regarding adherence, expectations, and AEs. J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(11):1017-1024. doi:10.36849/JDD.8639. "
"Abstract: Azathioprine (AZA) has been extensively used for immunomodulatory effects in autoimmune disorders and transplantation. This article is proposed to review the contemporary and prospective use of AZA in viral, rheumatic, and dermatological disorders. The primary objective is to draw attention to possible developments in regards to AZA application in recent years, with an emphasis on the use of pharmacogenomics and nanotechnology to improve its efficacy in practice. This study reveals that AZA, having the active metabolites 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 6-thioguanine (6-TG), may be useful in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), pemphigus vulgaris, and psoriasis. Pharmacogenomic testing of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and Nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15) genotypes minimizes the occurrence of myelosuppression. Furthermore, new formulations of AZA using biocompatible polymers and nanoparticles for drug delivery were reported to improve its efficacy and lower systemic toxicity. This paper aims to establish the multifunctional nature of AZA in modern medicine, thus emphasizing its potential for other applications. Through the combination of pharmacogenomic analysis along with nanotechnology application, AZA makes the promise of enhancing patients' treatment efficacy and extending the stock of medical information available. These advancements offer new possibilities for application of precision medicine and improvements in the use of AZA therapy. "
"Abstract: Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), seasonal affective disorder (SAD), and smoking cessation. It is also used off-label for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Its mechanism of action includes the selective norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). The drug is available in immediate-release (IR), sustained-release (SR), and extended-release (XL) formulations. Common side effects are typically mild and include anxiety, insomnia, headache, dizziness, constipation, and nausea. Rarely, cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions may occur. We describe a 23-year-old man who developed severe and diffuse urticaria and angioedema 4 weeks after initiation of bupropion XL for MDD and ADHD. The bupropion was stopped, and he was treated with levocetirizine, diphenhydramine (oral and topical), and methylprednisolone with complete resolution of his symptoms within 2 weeks. Due to a good initial therapeutic response to the medication, a trial of bupropion SR was initiated. The patient again had a favorable therapeutic response without any dermatologic side effects. "
"INTRODUCTION: Exosomes (Exos) are promising drug delivery systems due to their low immunogenicity, minimal toxicity, high biocompatibility, and effective delivery capabilities. However, addressing the cardiotoxicity and other toxic side effects associated with anthracyclines has proven challenging. METHODS: In this study, we loaded doxorubicin (Dox) into Exos derived from human placental mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and modified them with carboxylated Fe RESULTS: Our results indicated that Exo-Dox-NPs remain stable in the bloodstream while releasing the drug in the acidic environment of tumor cells and their lysosomes. As a drug delivery system, Exo-Dox-NPs enhanced Dox absorption by tumor cells, demonstrating high targeting specificity. Moreover, Exo-Dox-NPs inhibited the migration of breast cancer cells, as confirmed by scratch migration and Transwell Matrigel invasion assays. In vivo experiments confirmed the effective targeting and delivery of Dox to malignant tumors using Exo-Dox-NPs/MFs, with the Exo-Dox-NP/MF formulation exhibiting the most potent anti-tumor activity. CONCLUSION: The utilization of Exos as carriers for Dox showed promising efficacy in breast cancer management. Carboxylated Fe "

"BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids are among the few effective treatments for knee osteoarthritis, but short duration of action limits their utility. EP-104IAR, a long-acting formulation of fluticasone propionate for intra-articular injection, optimises the action of fluticasone propionate through novel diffusion-based extended-release technology. The SPRINGBOARD trial assessed the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of EP-104IAR in people with knee osteoarthritis. METHODS: SPRINGBOARD was a randomised, vehicle-controlled, double-blind, phase 2 trial done at 12 research sites in Denmark, Poland, and Czech Republic. We recruited adults aged 40 years or older with primary knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2-3) who reported Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scores of at least 4 and no more than 9 out of 10. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive one intra-articular dose of 25 mg EP-104IAR or vehicle control. Randomisation was done via interactive web-based access to a central predefined computer-generated list with block size of six (allocated by clinical site). Participants and assessors were masked to treatment allocation. Participants were followed up for 24 weeks. The primary outcome was the difference between groups in change in WOMAC pain score from baseline to week 12, analysed in all participants who were randomly assigned and received treatment. Safety, including laboratory analyses, and pharmacokinetics from quantification of fluticasone propionate in peripheral blood were assessed in all participants who received a dose of randomly assigned treatment. A person with lived experience of knee osteoarthritis was involved in study interpretation and writing of the report. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04120402, and the EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT 2021-000859-39, and is complete. FINDINGS: Between Sept 10, 2021, and Nov 16, 2022, 1294 people were screened for eligibility, and 319 were randomly assigned to EP-104IAR (n=164) or vehicle control (n=155). One participant in the EP-104IAR group was excluded from all analyses because treatment was not administered due to an adverse event. 318 participants (135 [42%] male and 183 [58%] female, 315 [99%] White) received randomly assigned treatment and were included in the primary analysis and safety analysis (EP-104IAR, n=163; vehicle control, n=155). At week 12, least squares mean change in WOMAC pain score from baseline was -2·89 (95% CI -3·22 to -2·56) in the EP-104IAR group and -2·23 (-2·56 to -1·89) in the vehicle control group, with a between-group difference of -0·66 (-1·11 to -0·21; p=0·0044); a significant between-group difference persisted to week 14. 106 (65%) of 163 participants in the EP-104IAR group had one or more treatment-emergent adverse event compared with 89 (57%) of 155 participants in the vehicle control group. Effects on serum glucose and cortisol concentrations were minimal and transient. There were no treatment-emergent deaths or treatment-related serious adverse events. Plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate showed a blunted initial peak with terminal half-life of approximately 18-20 weeks. INTERPRETATION: These phase 2 results suggest that EP-104IAR has the potential to offer clinically meaningful pain relief in knee osteoarthritis for an extended period of up to 14 weeks, longer than published data for currently marketed corticosteroids. There were minimal effects on glucose and cortisol, and stable fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma. The safety and efficacy of EP-104IAR will be further evaluated in phase 3 trials, including the possibility of bilateral and repeat dosing with EP-104IAR. FUNDING: Eupraxia Pharmaceuticals.

"BACKGROUND: Clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/adapalene 0.15%/benzoyl peroxide 3.1% gel (CAB) is the only fixed-dose triple-combination treatment approved for acne. This post hoc analysis assessed the impact of sex on efficacy and safety/tolerability of CAB. METHODS: In two multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 studies (NCT04214639 and NCT04214652), participants aged &ge;9 years with moderate-to-severe acne were randomized (2:1) to 12 weeks of once-daily treatment with CAB or vehicle gel. Pooled data were analyzed by sex. Assessments included treatment success (&ge;2-grade reduction from baseline in Evaluator&rsquo;s Global Severity Score and a score of 0 [clear] or 1 [almost clear]), inflammatory/noninflammatory lesion counts, Acne-Specific Quality of Life (Acne-QoL) questionnaire, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and cutaneous safety/tolerability. RESULTS: At week 12, treatment success rates were significantly greater with CAB versus vehicle irrespective of sex (females: 53.7% vs 23.0%; males: 43.1% vs 24.6%; P&lt;0.05, both). CAB-treated female and male participants both experienced greater reductions from baseline versus vehicle in inflammatory (females: 77.7% vs 57.9%; males: 77.5% vs 57.1%; P&lt;0.001, both) and noninflammatory lesions (females: 72.5% vs 45.6%; males: 72.3% vs 49.6%; P&lt;0.001, both). Acne-QoL improvements from baseline to week 12 were significantly greater with CAB than vehicle. No significant differences in any efficacy measures between CAB-treated males and females were observed. Most TEAEs were of mild-to-moderate severity; no sex-based trends for safety/tolerability were observed. CONCLUSIONS: CAB demonstrated comparable efficacy, quality-of-life improvements, and safety in female and male participants with moderate-to-severe acne. As the first fixed-dose, triple-combination topical formulation, CAB represents an important new treatment for acne. J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(10):873-881. doi:10.36849/JDD.8484. "
"Abstract: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most prevalent inflammatory skin conditions, characterized by recurrent eczema with varying degrees of erythema, pruritus, xerosis, and pain. Although there are many treatment options for AD, efficacy is limited by poor adherence, especially for topical medications. Patient preferences for certain vehicle formulations and frequencies of administration, as well as patient aversion to certain adverse effects, can negatively impact adherence and treatment success. Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are used to assess preferences in a manner comparable to clinical decision-making. Six discrete choice experiments on AD were analyzed to create a comprehensive data sheet of patient and physician preferences for medication. When choosing a medication, skin clearance, itch relief, and flexible treatments were most important to patients. J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(10):847-851.&nbsp; doi:10.36849/JDD.8056. "
"Abstract: CT-P13, a biosimilar of infliximab, is used to treat inflammatory diseases that arise from immune system complications, resulting in excessive and persistent inflammation. The subcutaneous (SC) formulation of CT-P13 overcomes the drawback of prolonged administration associated with the intravenous (IV) infliximab biosimilar, necessitating autoinjector (AI) administration. This randomized, open-label, two-arm, parallel-group, single-dose clinical pharmacology study aimed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of CT-P13 SC administration via AI compared with the existing pre-filled syringe (PFS) method. A total of 147 healthy participants were randomized into two groups, of which 139 completed the study. Blood samples were collected from before CT-P13 SC administration to 2016 h after the start of the administration. Serum concentrations were analyzed using the Meso Scale Discovery electrochemiluminescence method. Geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) of the AUC "
"Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most lethal human malignancies. The current standard-of-care is highly invasive with strong toxic side effects, leading to poor prognosis and high mortality. As a safe and effective clinical approach, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a suitable option for GBM. Nevertheless, its implementation is significantly impeded by the limits of light penetration depth and the firm reliance on oxygen. To overcome these challenges, herein, a promising strategy that harnesses a modified optical fiber and less oxygen-dependent Type I aggregation-induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer (PS) is developed for the first time to realize in vivo GBM treatments. The proposed AIE PS, namely TTTMN, characterized by a highly twisted molecular architecture and a bulky spacer, exhibits enhanced near-infrared emission and strong production of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals at the aggregated state, thus affording efficient fluorescence imaging-guided PDT once formulated into nanoparticles. The inhibition of orthotopic and subcutaneous GBM xenografts provides compelling evidence of the treatment efficacy of Type I PDT irradiated through a tumor-inserted optical fiber. These findings highlight the substantially improved therapeutic outcomes achieved through fiber optic-mediated Type I PDT, positioning it as a promising therapeutic modality for GBM. "
"Abstract: Excessive exposure to sunlight can contribute for skin photo-damage, such as sunburn, dryness, wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, immunosuppressive events and skin sensitization reactions. The use of aftersun products is an effective strategy to reduce the visible signs and symptoms of acute photodamage in the skin. Aiming to unveil the active ingredients able to offset acute sun damage, this work focuses on the characterization of the aftersun products market. A total of 84 after-sun formulations from 41 international brands currently marketed in Portugal were analyzed concerning the composition described on the product label, identifying natural and synthetic/semi-synthetic ingredients with the ability to mitigate solar-induced effects. The majority of aftersun formulations contained ingredients derived from terrestrial and marine sources (> 80%). An in-depth examination of these compounds is also offered, revealing the top of the most used natural and synthetic/semi-synthetic ingredients present in aftersun products, as well as their mechanism of action. A critical appraisal of the scientific data was made aiming to highlight the scientific evidence of ingredients able to mitigate skin photodamage. Amino acids and peptides, and A. barbadensis extract were tested for their in vivo efficacy. Nevertheless, all the ingredients were analyzed with in vitro studies as preliminary screening before in vivo, ex vivo and/or clinical studies. In summary, this study provides an overview of the use of active ingredients in commercial aftersun products to understand better the benefits associated with their use in cosmetic formulations and identify opportunities for innovation.

"BACKGROUND: Facial erythema from acne, vascular rosacea, or photoaging is a common difficult-to-treat dermatologic challenge. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the role of lapachol in alleviating facial erythema associated with a variety of common dermatologic conditions. METHODS: Twenty-five healthy female and male subjects 35-65 years of age of Fitzpatrick skin types I-II with mild-to-moderate stable facial erythema from acne, rosacea or photoaging were enrolled in a single-site monadic study. Subjects received the study cream for twice daily application and were assessed at baseline, Week 4, and Week 8. The dermatologist investigator and subjects assessed efficacy and tolerability and facial photographic images were taken of all subjects at each visit. Noninvasive erythema assessments of the face were conducted using a colorimeter at baseline, Week 4, and Week 8 to document improvement in facial erythema. RESULTS: Twenty-five out of 25 subjects successfully completed the study without tolerability issues including 12 subjects with rosacea, 6 subjects with photoaging and 7 subjects with acne. After 8 weeks of use, the investigator rated a 44% decrease in facial erythema while the subjects rated a 40% decrease. Facial erythema was also noninvasively assessed with a colorimeter and dermaspectrophotometer (DSP). There was a 26% decrease in skin redness at Week 4 and a 31% decrease in skin redness at Week 8 on the colorimeter L*a*b* scale. This finding was collaborated by the DSP which registered a 29% decrease on the erythema scale at Week 8. CONCLUSION: Lapachol in a moisturizer formulation was found to be effective in reducing facial erythema from acne, rosacea, and photoaging. "
"Abstract: Psoriasis, a chronic skin condition, affects around 2-5% of the population. Topical corticosteroids treat the vast majority of cases (> 80%). Because of the physicochemical characteristics of the damaged stratum corneum, all treatments are ineffective. Nevertheless, systemic immunosuppression, the oral strategy, has substantial adverse effects that may be avoided using the topical procedure. The research sought to determine if a salicylic acid-loaded microemulsion-based gel (emulgel) could successfully infiltrate and maintain salicylic acid in skin tissue for psoriasis treatment. The pseudo-ternary phase was generated in different Smix ratios (1:1, 2:1, and 3:1; Labrasol:Transcutol® P). At a 3:1 ratio, the Smix had a substantial microemulsion area. Microemulsion was characterized for particle size, pH, etc. For topical application, the selected microemulsion was combined with Carbopol 940 gel, and ex vivo permeation and drug retention study were conducted. The effectiveness of the developed gel was checked using the IMQ-induced psoriatic plaque model. Salicylic acid microemulsion has an average globule size of 79.72 nm, pH 5.93, and 100% transmittance. In an ex vivo diffusion study, emulgel revealed greater penetration and more drug retention than ordinary salicylic acid gel. The emulgel was non-irritating on the skin of rats. In vivo studies revealed significant antipsoriatic activity of microemulsion-loaded gel compared to the marketed product. Developed emulgel was considered a potential product for an effective and safe way to administer salicylic acid for the treatment of skin diseases such as psoriasis. "
"Abstract: Dasatinib (DAS) is an anticancer drug employed in the treatment of certain hematological malignancies. Although DAS has been mainly developed for oral administration, it has recently garnered attention for its possible topical application. The use of topical drugs can cause photosensitivity, which is not listed as an adverse reaction for DAS. Since DAS absorbs UVA, it could potentially induce photosensitivity reactions and lead to oxidative damage to cellular targets. This study aims to investigate whether DAS exhibits phototoxic reactions on primary cellular targets in both solution and artificial skin, mimicking topical drug administration. It also examines the potential generation of highly reactive intermediates like organic radicals and ROS, which could trigger photosensitivity reactions. Upon DAS irradiation in the UVA region, the first transient species detected was the diradicaloid triplet excited state ( "
"Abstract: Capsaicin is the hot and pungent ingredient of chili peppers. It is a potent pain-relieving agent and is often present in over-the-counter analgesic lotions and creams. Several convergent studies reveal that capsaicin displays growth-suppressive activity in human cancers in vitro and in vivo. Apart from its growth-suppressive activity (as a single agent), capsaicin has been found to sensitize human cancer cells to the pro-apoptotic effects of chemotherapy and radiation. The first part of this book chapter discusses the anti-cancer activity of capsaicin in gynecological cancers in cell culture experiments and mouse models. Out of all gynecological cancers, the anti-cancer activity of capsaicin (and its analogs) has only been investigated in cervical cancers and ovarian cancers. The clinical development of capsaicin as a viable anti-cancer drug has remained challenging due to its poor bioavailability and aqueous solubility properties. In addition, the administration of capsaicin is associated with adverse side effects like gastrointestinal cramps, stomach pain, irritation in the gut, nausea diarrhea and vomiting. Two strategies have been investigated to overcome these drawbacks of capsaicin. The first is to encapsulate capsaicin in sustained release drug delivery systems. The second strategy is to design non-pungent capsaicin analogs which will retain the anti-tumor activity of capsaicin. The second part of this chapter provides an overview of the anti-neoplastic (and chemosensitization activity) of capsaicin analogs and capsaicin-based sustained release formulations in cervical and ovarian cancers. The design of selective non-pungent capsaicin analogs and capsaicin-based polymeric drug delivery systems may foster the hope of novel strategies for the treatment and management of gynecological cancers.

"BACKGROUND: The SkinMedica Acne Treatment Platform (SM Regimen) was formulated to treat acne without overdrying the skin. We evaluated efficacy and tolerability of the SM Regimen (including a novel 1% salicylic acid Acne Clarifying Cleanser and 2% salicylic acid Acne Treatment Lotion) versus a prescription formulation (Rx Regimen; including adapalene 0.1%/benzoyl peroxide 2.5%) in a diverse population of adults with mild to moderate facial acne. METHODS: This single-center, double-blind, randomized study enrolled adults (18-45 years) with Fitzpatrick skin types (FST) I-VI. SM Regimen or Rx Regimen was applied topically to the entire face for 12 weeks. Assessments were conducted at 24 and 48 h and 4, 8, and 12 weeks. RESULTS: Subjects (SM Regimen, n = 31; Rx Regimen, n = 23) were primarily female (90.7%) with mean age of 28.6 years; 53.8% had FST IV-VI. Efficacy was comparable between regimens. The SM regimen resulted in significant improvements versus baseline in mean Investigator's Global Assessment of acne severity from 48 h through week 12 (p ≤ 0.001), as well as significant and sustained improvements from baseline in total acne lesion count, global postinflammatory hyperpigmentation/postinflammatory erythema, and oiliness. The SM Regimen was well tolerated at all time points, with mean scores below mild for all parameters; the Rx Regimen caused significantly more tightness/dry feeling at week 4 versus SM Regimen (p = 0.008). Subjects (> 96%) reported high satisfaction with the SM Regimen at all time points. CONCLUSIONS: The SM Regimen reduced acne severity and skin oiliness, evening out skin tone without overdrying or irritating the skin. "
"Abstract: Capsicum oleoresin has potential health benefits, particularly against obesity markers. Due to its high pungency, few studies have been done to explore the intake of this ingredient. The objective of this study was to use the Capsicum oleoresin (CO) microencapsulated into a high-fat diet to evaluate its metabolic effect on mice. Two formulation containing 15 % solids were prepared: the first (F1) with 5% CO and 95% emulsifier, and the second (F2) with 2.5% corn oil, 2.5% CO, and 95% emulsifier. These formulation were atomized in a spray dryer. Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography determined the capsaicin content for both formulations. Mice were divided into two groups: lean control (normocaloric AIN diet, n = 10) and high fat (HF diet: hypercaloric, n = 30), which were subdivided into three subgroups: HF control diet (n = 10); diet F1: HF + 20 % CO oleoresin microparticles (n = 10); and diet F2: HF + 20 % CO microparticles containing corn oil (n = 10). The animals treated with the microparticles showed lower glucose levels than the HF control. Mice fed with HF-containing CO microparticles had cholesterol blood levels similar to that of the lean group and lower (<100 mg/dL) than that of the HF control group (150 mg/dL). Capsicum oleoresin microparticles added to high-fat diets promoted lower weight gain and protected the liver against hepatic steatosis. Leptin levels for mice fed with HF diet plus CO microparticles averaged between 2 and 5 ng/ml, whereas the fat control group developed leptin resistance. Capsicum microparticles evidenced a protective effect against dyslipidemia compared to the fat control group, which suggests their use as a potential ingredient for the control of obesity. "
"BACKGROUND: Bilastine is a well-known non-sedating second-generation antihistamine authorised worldwide for the symptomatic treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (seasonal and perennial) and urticaria with proven efficacy and good safety and tolerability profile. When the oral route is not suitable or a rapid onset of action is preferred, parenteral formulations represent an effective treatment option. However, the parenteral formulations currently available are sedating antihistamines. The objective of this research was to compare the peripheral anti-H METHODS: This was a single-dose, randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase I clinical study performed on 25 adult healthy volunteers that compared the peripheral antihistaminic activity of a single dose of bilastine 12 mg i.v., bilastine 12 mg i.m., bilastine 20 mg oral tablets and dexchlorpheniramine 5 mg i.m. among them and versus placebo by inhibiting the histamine-induced wheal and flare (W&F) response. Pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability were also evaluated. RESULTS: All bilastine formulations showed a rapid onset of action (15 min for parenteral and 30 min for the oral formulation), and the maximum effect in both wheal (i.v. 74.44 %; i.m.:74.29 %; oral 70,27 %) and flare area reduction (i.v. and i.m. 80.63 %; oral 77.67 %), was significantly larger compared to dexchlorpheniramine i.m. (25.85 % for wheal and 28.65 % for flare) and placebo (1.35 % for wheal and 4.02 % for flare). A more pronounced reduction in itching score was reached for bilastine oral, followed by i.m. and i.v. formulations. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported during the study, and 8 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 5 subjects, all resolved without sequelae. For psychomotor assessments, dexchlorpheniramine i.m. showed a fast onset of drowsiness, as well as decreased attention and coordination when compared to all bilastine formulations and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: All bilastine formulations showed a peripheral H "

Ongoing research into novel delivery systems continues to enhance the future of dermatological treatments. "
"Abstract: Mosquito-borne diseases continue to pose significant threats to human populations, especially in developing and underdeveloped regions, where access to effective preventive measures remains limited. Mosquito repellents represent a cornerstone in the arsenal against these diseases, providing a barrier against mosquito bites. Mosquito repellents come in various formulations, including topical ointments and commercial vaporizers, with varying compositions. Common constituents include deodorized kerosene (DOK) as a solvent, pyrethroids, amides, essential oils for fragrance, and synergists. Despite their widespread use, the toxicological profiles of these repellents remain inadequately understood, raising questions about their safety in prolonged or excessive exposure scenarios. However, while their efficacy in preventing mosquito-borne illnesses is well-established, concerns persist regarding their potential toxicity to humans and the environment. This review critically examines the existing literature on the toxicity of mosquito repellents, focusing on their adverse effects on human health and environmental sustainability. Through an extensive analysis of available research, this review aims to shed light on the potential health risks associated with mosquito repellents, such as dermatological irritation, respiratory complications, and allergic reactions in humans.

"Abstract: Chemical warfare agents, particularly vesicants like lewisite, pose a threat due to their ability to cause skin damage through accidental exposure or deliberate attacks. Lewisite rapidly penetrates the skin, causing inflammation and blistering. This study focuses on developing a cream formulation of a therapeutic agent, called integrated stress response inhibitor (ISRIB), to treat lewisite-induced injuries. Moreover, animal studies demonstrate a molecular target engagement (ISR) and significant efficacy of ISRIB against lewisite-induced cutaneous injury. The goal of this formulation is to enhance the delivery of ISRIB directly to affected skin areas using an oil-in-water cream emulsion system. We investigated various excipients, including oils, surfactants, emollients, and permeation enhancers, to optimize ISRIB's solubility and penetration through the skin. The result of this study indicated that the optimal formulation includes 30 % w/w of N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone, dimethyl sulfoxide and Azone® at a pH of 5. 5. It delivered the highest amount of ISRIB into the skin, demonstrating highest skin absorption with no detectable systemic exposure. Additionally, characterization of the cream, including texture analysis, emulsion type, and content uniformity, confirmed its' suitability for topical application. These findings suggest that ISRIB cream formulation is a promising approach for the localized treatment of skin injuries caused by lewisite. "
"Abstract: UV radiation causes long- and short-term skin damage, such as erythema and skin cancer. Therefore, the use of sunscreens is extremely important. However, concerns about UV filter safety have prompted exploration into alternative solutions, with nanotechnology emerging as a promising avenue. This systematic review identified 23 experimental studies utilizing nanocarriers to encapsulate sunscreens with the aim of enhancing their efficacy and safety. Polymeric and lipid nanoparticles are frequently employed to encapsulate both organic and inorganic UV filters along with natural antioxidants. Nanocarriers have demonstrated benefits including reduced active ingredient usage, increased sun protection factor, and mitigated photoinstability. Notably, they also decreased the skin absorption of UV filters. In summary, nanocarriers represent a viable strategy for improving sunscreen formulations, offering enhanced physicochemical properties and bolstered photoprotective effects, thereby addressing concerns regarding UV filter safety and efficacy in cosmetic applications.

"Abstract: Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) are drugs that block tyrosine kinases responsible for transducing cytokine signals. The first JAKi was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011 to treat rheumatoid arthritis in adults. A pediatric indication was not approved until 8 years later, for acute graft-versus-host disease. Since then, topical and oral formulations have gained FDA approval for pediatric patients with dermatologic diseases. While increasing evidence supports the safety of these medications in adults, data are limited in children. We sought to determine whether JAKi adverse events (AEs) as reported in clinical trials and via postapproval pharmacovigilance services are comparable in adult and pediatric patients. Pharmacovigilance data were extracted from the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System and the Canada Vigilance Adverse Reaction Online Database for baricitinib, upadacitinib, abrocitinib, ruxolitinib, and tofacitinib. The pooled data were analyzed to detect the most common AEs for specific JAKi and for the drug class. We assessed 399,649 AEs from 133,216 adults and 2883 AEs from 955 patients under 18 years old and identified slightly different AE profiles for the two age groups. Both populations had increased risk for infections and gastrointestinal AEs. However, pediatric patients reported a higher proportion of blood and lymphatic disorders, while reports of nervous system and musculoskeletal/connective tissue disorders were more common in adults. The spectrum of AEs extracted from pharmacovigilance reports was similar to clinical trials. The JAKi AE profiles we observed may prove helpful in counseling patients and their parents before starting therapy and for monitoring once patients are on therapy. "
"BACKGROUND: Mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris (AV) is common among adults, and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) has a long history of efficacy in reducing AV lesions. The efficacy of BPO is comparable for concentrations from 2.5% to 10% used as leave-on therapy, but tolerability is usually best at lower concentrations formulated in well-designed vehicles and with newer formulation methods such as micronization. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of a 2.6% BPO cleanser (Complexion Clearing AV Cleanser, CCAC) in mild-to-moderate AV. METHODS: This was a single-center, open-label, 4-week study of subjects aged 18 to 45 years (n=28) with self-perceived sensitive skin and mild-to-moderate AV. CCAC was applied twice daily (morning and evening) on damp skin. Assessments included lesion counts, clinical photography with porphyrin analysis, patient self-assessment questionnaires, collection of adverse events, and standard tolerability ratings. RESULTS: Total lesion counts were significantly reduced by week 1 of CCAC cleanser use (-25.2%, P&lt;0.05). At week 4, AV lesions were numerically reduced but did not reach statistical significance. Additionally, there was a significant reduction of porphyrin counts at week 1 (-19.4% right side face, -28.8% left side, P&lt;0.05 vs baseline). CCAC was well tolerated, with no significant increase in tolerability ratings at any time point compared to baseline, and patients reported good satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: CCAC was efficacious in reducing AV lesions in as little as one week, and a trend in reduction was shown through week 4. Additionally, this 2.6% BPO cleanser was also shown to be very well tolerated and well-liked by subjects with self-perceived sensitive skin.

"Abstract: The treatment of unresectable locally advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and TNBC with metastasis is challenging. Many anticancer drugs, such as doxorubicin, still hinder positive therapeutic outcomes due to severe side effects. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has an anticancer effect, and combining PDT with chemotherapy may improve breast cancer therapy. The use of cargo-loaded biomimetic PEGylated liposomes for cancer therapy may enhance efficacy and reduce side effects. In this study, liposomes were formulated to accommodate doxorubicin (Dox) and IR780. Breast cancer cells (4T1 cells) and macrophage cell membranes were isolated and camouflaged onto the PEGylated liposomes, creating a new biomimetic platform called Dox-IR780@Lip@Ms. The Dox-IR780@Lip@Ms platform was characterized and tested  "
"Abstract: While neurosurgical interventions are frequently used in laboratory mice, refinement efforts to optimize analgesic management based on multimodal approaches appear to be rather limited. Therefore, we compared the efficacy and tolerability of combinations of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug carprofen, a sustained-release formulation of the opioid buprenorphine, and the local anesthetic bupivacaine with carprofen monotherapy. Female and male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to isoflurane anesthesia and an intracranial electrode implant procedure. Given the multidimensional nature of postsurgical pain and distress, various physiological, behavioral, and biochemical parameters were applied for their assessment. The analysis revealed alterations in Neuro scores, home cage locomotion, body weight, nest building, mouse grimace scales, and fecal corticosterone metabolites. A composite measure scheme allowed the allocation of individual mice to severity classes. The comparison between groups failed to indicate the superiority of multimodal regimens over high-dose NSAID monotherapy. In conclusion, our findings confirmed the informative value of various parameters for assessment of pain and distress following neurosurgical procedures in mice. While all drug regimens were well tolerated in control mice, our data suggest that the total drug load should be carefully considered for perioperative management. Future studies would be of interest to assess potential synergies of drug combinations with lower doses of carprofen. "
"INTRODUCTION: Biological medications have significantly improved the prognosis of psoriasis patients. All biological drugs (except infliximab) for psoriasis require subcutaneous (SC) administration. Adverse events of biologic drug treatment include injection site reactions. ISRs are a local phenomenon characterized by swelling, erythema, pruritus, and pain around the injection site. AREAS COVERED: We conducted a review to analyze the differences between the ISRs of various biologics approved for psoriasis. Specifically, the review focused on anti-TNF-α, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL-17, and anti-IL-23 drugs. EXPERT OPINION: Etanercept and adalimumab have reported ISR rates of 37% and 20%, respectively, with erythema, pruritus, pain, and irritation being the most common. Citrate free (CF) solution and thinner needles have reduced ISR associated with adalimumab. Ustekinumab showed a low risk of ISR. Regarding secukinumab and ixekizumab, pain was found to be the most common ISR. The introduction of CF ixekizumab formulation has shown promise in reducing ISRs associated with ixekizumab. The risk of ISR appears insignificant with bimekizumab, brodalumab, and anti-IL23 drugs, with ISR rates ranging from less than 1% to 7.1%. The choice of biologic agent should consider ISR risk. Education on injection techniques and the use of single-dose autoinjectors/pens can mitigate ISR risk. "
INTRODUCTION: Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a distinct form of acute myeloid leukemia characterized by the presence of t(15;17)(q24;21) and the  AREAS COVERED: Aspects on the development of oral-ATO-based regimens for APL in the frontline and relapsed setting are discussed. The short-term and long-term safety and efficacy of oral-ATO-based regimens are discussed. The frontline use of oral-ATO in combination with ATRA and ascorbic acid (AAA) induction in a 'chemotherapy-free' is highlighted. EXPERT OPINION: Current and ongoing data on the use of oral-ATO-based regimens in APL support the use of oral-ATO as an alternative to i.v.-ATO allowing a more convenient and economical approach to the management of APL. 
"INTRODUCTION: As cancer therapy progresses, challenges remain due to the inherent drawbacks of conventional treatments such as chemotherapy, gene therapy, radiation therapy, and surgical removal. Moreover, due to their associated side effects, conventional treatments affect both cancerous and normal cells, making photodynamic therapy (PDT) an attractive alternative. METHODS: As a result of its minimal toxicity, exceptional specificity, and non-invasive characteristics, PDT represents an innovative and highly promising cancer treatment strategy using photosensitizers (PSs) and precise wavelength excitation light to introduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the vicinity of cancer cells. RESULTS: Poor aqueous solubility and decreased sensitivity of Rhodamine 6G (R6G) prevent its use as a photosensitizer in PDT, necessitating the development of oxidized sodium alginate (OSA) hydrogelated nanocarriers to enhance its bioavailability, targeted distribution, and ROS-quantum yield. The ROS quantum yield increased from 0.30 in an aqueous environment to 0.51 when using alginate-based formulations, and it was further enhanced to 0.81 in the case of OSA. CONCLUSION: Furthermore, the nanoformulations produced fluorescent signals suitable for use as cellular imaging agents, demonstrating contrast-enhancing capabilities in medical imaging and showing minimal toxicity.

"Abstract: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a rapidly prevailing disease throughout the world that poses boundless risk factors linked to several health problems. Vildagliptin is the standard dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor type of medication that is used for the treatment of diabetes anti-hyperglycemic agent (anti-diabetic drug). The current study aimed to synthesize vildagliptin-loaded ZnO NPs for enhanced efficacy in terms of increased retention time minimizing side effects and increased hypoglycemic effects. Herein, Zinc Oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) were constructed by precipitation method then the drug vildagliptin was loaded and drug loading efficiency was estimated by the HPLC method. X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), UV-vis spectroscopy, FT-IR, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and EDX analysis were performed for the characterization of synthesized vildagliptin-loaded ZnO NPs. The UV-visible spectrum shows a distinct peak at 363 nm which confirms the creation of ZnO NPs and SEM showed mono-dispersed sphere-shaped NPs. EDX analysis shows the presence of desired elements along with the elemental composition. The physio-sorption studies, which used adsorption isotherms to assess adsorption capabilities, found that the Freundlich isotherm model explains the data very well and fits best. The maximum adsorption efficiency of 58.83% was obtained. Further, In vitro, anti-diabetic activity was evaluated by determining the α-amylase and DPP IV inhibition activity of the product formed. The formulation gave maximum inhibition of 82.06% and 94.73% of α-amylase and DPP IV respectively. While at 1000 µg/ml concentration with IC "
"Abstract: Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin condition, with high prevalence in children. Sun protection is important for children with eczema and AD-prone skin, yet many sunscreens can cause skin irritation due to their formulations. In this study, we evaluated the safety and tolerance of an SPF 50 sunscreen in ethnically diverse children with a history of AD over 4 weeks of product use. A total of 45 children from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds, aged 3 to 12 years old with skin phototypes I-VI, plus a history of eczema and perceived sensitive skin completed the study. All participants applied sunscreen daily on the face and body, at least 15 minutes prior to sun exposure and as needed. After 4 weeks, evaluations were performed by a dermatologist and by participants for tolerability. Product performance questionnaires were also completed by parents/guardians of pediatric participants. After 4 weeks of sunscreen application, tolerability assessments of skin dryness, peeling, erythema, and edema were all absent in children participants. Parent/guardian evaluations of sunscreen tolerability for their child also revealed no perceived skin issues. These results were consistent with no adverse event being observed throughout the study. Parents/guardians reported that sunscreen application on children was smooth and even, with the absence of a white cast appearance on children with skin of color. We conclude from this study that this SPF 50 sunscreen is safe to use in ethnically diverse children with a history of AD and sensitive skin.

"BACKGROUND: The combined use of topical calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (Cal/BDP) is commonly used and demonstrated to be effective for the management of psoriasis and is shown to confer local anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects. The use of the two agents in combination is synergistic. Despite the demonstrated efficacy of topically applied combination Cal/BDP, successful management of a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin disease such as psoriasis in the real-world setting may be hindered if patients do not adhere to the dosing or frequency of application recommendations from their prescriber. Patient preference for and satisfaction with the topical treatment vehicle have been shown to influence adherence. A recent analysis has determined that patients perceived Cal/BDP cream vehicle with PAD technology as having favorable characteristics. This randomized, split-body study was undertaken to further assess patient satisfaction with Cal/BDP cream and Cal/BDP foam formulations. TRIAL DESIGN: This was a split-body, subject-blind study. Study cream was administered in a single application to one side of the scalp and/or body; study foam was applied to the contralateral side. Patient self-administered questionnaires were completed before and after product application after a single site visit. RESULTS: Mean overall Vehicle Preference Measure (VPM) scores were higher for Cal/BDP cream than Cal/BDP foam (P=0.0043). Cal/BDP cream also achieved higher individual scores for ease of application, feeling to the touch, smell, and feeling on the skin (P&lt;0.03). With regards to scalp application, subject assessments show that the cream was significantly more preferred in terms of limiting daily disruption (P=0.0008) Conclusion: Results of this study suggest that patients may prefer Cal/BDP cream over Cal/BDP foam for the management of psoriasis on the body and the scalp. Cal/BDP cream outperformed Cal/BDP foam on several specific measures of satisfaction and overall satisfaction measures. J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(8):607-611.&nbsp; doi:10.36849/JDD.7993. "

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cyclosporine is a versatile immunomodulatory drug commonly employed in modern medicine. Although cyclosporine was initially used to prevent solid organ transplant rejection, its indications have extended to treat many inflammatory or autoimmune diseases. Cyclosporin is available for use in oral, intravenous, and topical forms, including eye drops to treat corneal and ocular surface conditions. It is naturally advantageous to administer cyclosporin directly into the eye, avoiding potential and dose limiting systemic adverse effects. However, the transition from systemic to topical administration has been a challenging one. This report reviews the evolution of ophthalmic cyclosporine treatment and explores its clinical impacts and future research directions. RECENT FINDINGS: Latest advancements in formulations - from oil-based solutions to nanomicelle and gel systems and waterless formulations - have improved the therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of topically applied cyclosporine, demonstrating greater effectiveness in treating ocular surface parameters compared to oil-based solution. SUMMARY: Cyclosporine continues to be a safe and effective immunomodulatory drug in the field of ophthalmology to treat various chronic inflammatory ocular surface diseases and dry eye. Currently, there are several commercially available topical preparations available for ophthalmic use each with unique formulation and clinical outcomes. "
"BACKGROUND: In this paper, we have discussed recent advances in our understanding of the aetiology of psoriasis, particularly as they relate to aryl hydrocarbon receptors in DCs, Langerhans cells, macrophages, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathways, and dermal vascular endothelial cells. Here, we have shown that the ability to target specific cellular and molecular components of psoriasis pathogenesis with nanoscale precision using phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors represents a transformative opportunity to address the complex nature of this dermatological condition. OBJECTIVE: In this review, we have examined the molecular mechanisms behind the pathogenic features of psoriasis and new treatments being tested in clinical settings. There is research being done on new treatments created in the last ten years. This field highlights the advantages of nanotechnological technologies as cutting-edge candidates for drug delivery systems in psoriasis and other inflammatory chronic skin disorders. Future Developments: Nanotechnology-based treatments currently under study show good efficacy and low side effect profiles. However, long-term prospective trials are required to demonstrate long-term safety and effectiveness. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, Janus kinase inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, combinations of vitamin D3 derivatives and corticosteroids, and coal tar formulations are some of the newer topical treatments for psoriasis. CONCLUSION: The psoriasis treatment continues to involve conventional medications (i.e., medicines that are generally acknowledged as either normal therapy or outdated remedies), whether used topically or orally. Nonetheless, we are starting to see initiatives to create pharmaceuticals and biosimilars with better therapeutic results, fewer side effects, and greater efficacy. "
"Abstract: Despite the wide range of treatment options available for cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgical procedures, each of these treatments has a different side-effect profile and leaves the patient with no option but to choose. Due to their insensitivity and nonspecificity, conventional treatments damage normal cells together with cancer cells. In recent years, a significant amount of attention has been focused on photodynamic therapy (PDT) as a treatment for cancer and drug-resistant microbes. An activated photosensitizer is used as a part of the procedure along with oxygen molecules and a specific wavelength of light belonging to the visible or NIR spectral zone. A light-sensitive laser dye, rhodamine 6G (R6G), was used in the present study as a photosensitizer, taking a challenge to improve the aqueous solubility and ROS quantum yield using optimum concentration (160 mg/ml) of chitosan-alginate (Cs-Alg) blended polymeric nanoformulations. As evidenced by steady-state spectrophotometric and fluorometric measurements, ROS quantum yield increases three-fold over aqueous solution along with solubility gaining that was validated by PDT experiment using human epithelial carcinoma (KB) cell line. Phantom optical imaging was taken using the IVIS imaging system to establish the formulations as a fluorescence-based optical contrast agent, and zebrafish embryos were used to establish their safe in vivo use. The release profile of R6G was fitted using kinetic models, which followed the Non-Fickian kinetic profile. In conclusion, we recommend the formulations as a potential theranostic agent that will aid in PDT-based therapy in conjunction with optical imaging-based diagnosis. "
"Abstract: The global market for alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) is undergoing significant expansion, propelled by increasing demand for skincare products that address aging and environmental damage. This review focuses on the dermatological applications of AHAs, particularly in cosmetic formulations like chemical peels. We have identified that AHAs, such as glycolic and lactic acids, enhance skin rejuvenation by promoting apoptosis in skin cells, boosting collagen and elastin synthesis, and improving skin texture and luminosity. Our comprehensive analysis reveals a nuanced understanding of AHAs' effectiveness across various skin types and conditions, demonstrating their broad utility in treating conditions like acne, hyperpigmentation, and photoaging. However, the optimal concentrations for therapeutic efficacy with minimal side effects are yet to be precisely defined, necessitating further research. Regulatory compliance is underscored as essential for the safe application of AHAs in cosmetics, with international guidelines recommending specific concentrations and pH levels to minimize potential skin irritation. In Conclusion, the review highlights the effectiveness of AHAs in cosmetic dermatology, emphasizing the necessity for continued research and rigorous regulatory adherence to maximize their safe and beneficial application worldwide.

"OBJECTIVE: The emergence of new human and environmental-related toxicity data associated with some common UV filters has catalysed growing interest in the inclusion of boosters and stabilizing ingredients in sunscreens. One approach is to incorporate alternative materials inspired by or mimetic of systems in biology, which offer a notable evolutionary advantage of multifunctionality and stability with increased biocompatibility. We describe the use of a natural product, Xanthochrome® (INCI: Ammonium Xanthommatin), in a series of studies designed to not only assess its safety with marine systems but also its formulation compatibility and function in water-in-oil mineral sunscreens. Xanthochrome is the synthetic form of the naturally occurring chromophore xanthommatin (XA) present in cephalopod skin, which doubles as a photostable antioxidant; however, it has never been explored in combination with mineral UV filters in finished formulations. METHODS: Given the recent controversies associated with the environmental toxicological effects of some chemicals used in sunscreens, the safety of XA with coral cuttings was first validated at concentrations 5× above those used in our formulations. Next, a particle-based delivery of XA was designed and incorporated into a zinc oxide (ZnO)-based water-in-oil sunscreen, where the SPF, critical wavelength, and visible light (VL) blocking potential were measured. RESULTS: We observed no adverse effects of XA at 100 mg/L when tested with coral cuttings, demonstrating its safety at concentrations exceeding those used in our sunscreens. When formulated with ZnO-based sunscreens, the inclusion of XA increased the total UV absorbance profile by 28% and the total blocking potential of VL by 45%. The formulations also elicited no dermal irritation or sensitization in a human insult repeat patch test (N = 100 subjects). CONCLUSIONS: XA is differentiated as a photostable, water-soluble compound that is a VL booster proven safe for skin and coral cuttings. To the best of our knowledge, there are no other boosters that can be classified as such, despite a growing body of literature highlighting the need in the industry. OBJECTIF: L'émergence de nouvelles données de toxicité liées à l'environnement et à l'homme associées à certains filtres UV courants a suscité un intérêt croissant pour l'inclusion d'agents rehausseurs et d'ingrédients stabilisants dans les écrans solaires. Une approche consiste à intégrer des matériaux alternatifs inspirés ou mimétiques des systèmes en biologie, ce qui offre une biocompatibilité accrue et un avantage évolutif notable en matière de multifonctionnalité et de stabilité. Nous décrivons l'utilization d'un produit naturel, le Xanthochrome® (INCI: ammonium de xanthommatine), dans une série d'études conçues non seulement pour évaluer sa sécurité d'emploi avec les systèmes marins, mais également sa compatibilité et sa fonction de formulation dans les écrans solaires minéraux à base d'eau en huile. Le xanthochrome est la forme synthétique de la xanthommatine chromophore (XA) naturellement présente dans la peau des céphalopodes, qui fait office d'antioxydant photostable; cependant, il n'a jamais été étudié en association avec des filtres minéraux UV dans des formulations finies. MÉTHODES: Compte tenu des controverses récentes associées aux effets toxicologiques environnementaux de certains produits chimiques utilisés dans les écrans solaires, la sécurité d'emploi de l'XA sur les coupes de corail a été d'abord validée à des concentrations 5 fois supérieures à celles utilisées dans nos formulations. Ensuite, une application d'XA à base de particules a été conçue et incorporée dans un écran solaire à base d'oxyde de zinc (ZnO), dans lequel le facteur SPF, la longueur d'onde critique et le potentiel bloquant de la lumière visible (LV) ont été mesurés. RÉSULTATS: Nous n'avons pas observé d'effets indésirables de l'XA à raison de 100 mg/L lors de tests sur des coupes de corail, ce qui démontre sa sécurité d'emploi à des concentrations supérieures à celles utilisées dans nos écrans solaires. Lorsqu'il est formulé avec des écrans solaires à base de ZnO, l'inclusion de XA a augmenté le profil d'absorbance totale des UV de 28% et le potentiel bloquant total de la LV de 45%. Les formulations n'ont également entraîné aucune irritation ou sensibilisation cutanée lors d'un test épicutané d'exposition répétée chez l'homme (N = 100 sujets). CONCLUSIONS: Le XA se différencie par un composé soluble dans l'eau et photostable qui est un amplificateur de la LV éprouvé sans danger pour les coupes de peau et de corail. À notre connaissance, il n'existe aucun autre agent rehausseur pouvant être classé comme tel, malgré un corpus croissant de littérature soulignant le besoin dans l'industrie. "
"Abstract: The skin of newborns is classified as sensitive, with a higher risk of skin barrier disruption and irritation of a diapered area. Despite dermatologist recommendations to use only water and a cloth for cleaning, most of the population still relies on the comforts of modern parenting, which includes intensive daily usage of baby wet wipes. Novel baby formulations are designed following the concept of infant skin health, containing a gentle cleanser, suitable emollient, and buffer system enabling a slightly acidic pH value and they are free of ethyl alcohol. Thus, it is important to understand the chemical background of such a complex liquid formulation, with emphasis on its safety. In line with this, the present paper discusses the scientific background of various chemical compounds found in baby wipe formulations to improve the understanding of wet wipe designs and direct them toward more skin-friendly solutions.

"BACKGROUND: Melasma is a common condition that affects a patient's quality of life. Metformin is a cheap, well-tolerated and relatively safe medication that is widely prescribed for the treatment of diabetes. Topical metformin has shown promising results in treating melasma as well as several other dermatological conditions such as acne and recalcitrant central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia. OBJECTIVES: To study the efficacy and safety of a once-weekly topical metformin-30%-loaded peel-off mask for treating melasma. METHODS: Twenty female patients with melasma were recruited for the application of a metformin mask and placebo mask to either side of the face once weekly for 12 weeks. The hemi-Melasma Area Severity Index (hemi-MASI) was calculated at baseline, at each visit and 12 weeks after the end of treatment. RESULTS: At baseline, the hemi-MASI score matched between both metformin and placebo sides [7.1 (SD 2.6) and 7.1 (SD 2.6), respectively, P = 0.99]. At the end of the active treatment period, the metformin side showed a significantly better improvement in hemi-MASI score in comparison with placebo [68% (SD 0.2%) improvement on the metformin side in contrast to 20% (SD 0.2%) on the placebo side]. Although scores decreased 3 months after stopping the active treatment [52% (SD 0.2%) improvement on the metformin side compared with the placebo side 15% (SD 0.2%)], they were still significantly better than baseline. No adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Topical metformin-loaded peel-off masks can be a promising, safe and effective treatment for melasma. Although applied only once weekly, metformin peel-off masks show comparable efficacy to previously reported daily usage formulations. "
"OBJECTIVE: Zinc Oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) are used widely in nowadays personal care products, especially sunscreens, as a protector against UV irradiation. Yet, they have some reports of potential toxicity. Silica is widely used to cage ZnO NPs to reduce their potential toxicity. Vitamin C derivative, Magnesium Ascorpyl Phosphate (MAP), is a potent antioxidant that can efficiently protect human skin from harmful impacts of UV irradiation and oxidative stress. The combination of silica coated ZnO NPs and MAP nanovesicles could have potential synergistic protective effect against skin photodamage. METHODS: Silica coated ZnO NPs and MAP nanovesicles (ethosomes and niosomes) were synthesized, formulated, and evaluated as topical gels. These gel formulations were evaluated in mice for their photoprotective effect against UV irradiation through histopathology and immuno-histochemistry study. Split-face clinical study was conducted to compare the effect of application of silica coated ZnO NPs either alone or combined with MAP nanovesicles. Their photoprotective action was evaluated, using Antera 3D® camera, for melanin level, roughness index and wrinkles depth. RESULTS: Silica coated ZnO NPs when combined with MAP nanovesicles protected mice skin from UV irradiation and decreased the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines, NF-κB. Clinically, silica coated ZnO NPs, alone or combined with MAP nanovesicles, could have significant effect to decrease melanin level, roughness index and wrinkles depth with higher effect for the combination. CONCLUSION: A composite of silica coated ZnO NPs and MAP nanovesicles could be a promising cosmetic formulation for skin protection against photodamage signs such as hyperpigmentation, roughness, and wrinkles.

"Abstract: Skin diseases pose challenges in treatment due to the skin's complex structure and protective functions. Topical drug delivery has emerged as a preferred method for treating these conditions, offering localized therapy with minimal systemic side effects. However, the skin's barrier properties frequently limit topical treatments' efficacy by preventing drug penetration into deeper skin layers. In recent years, laser-assisted drug delivery (LADD) has gained attention as a promising strategy to overcome these limitations. LADD involves using lasers to create microchannels in the skin, facilitating the deposition of drugs and enhancing their penetration into the target tissue. Several lasers, such as fractional CO "
"IMPORTANCE: Preoperative skin antisepsis is an established procedure to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs). The choice of antiseptic agent, povidone iodine or chlorhexidine gluconate, remains debated. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether povidone iodine in alcohol is noninferior to chlorhexidine gluconate in alcohol to prevent SSIs after cardiac or abdominal surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, cluster-randomized, investigator-masked, crossover, noninferiority trial; 4403 patients undergoing cardiac or abdominal surgery in 3 tertiary care hospitals in Switzerland between September 2018 and March 2020 were assessed and 3360 patients were enrolled (cardiac, n = 2187 [65%]; abdominal, n = 1173 [35%]). The last follow-up was on July 1, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Over 18 consecutive months, study sites were randomly assigned each month to either use povidone iodine or chlorhexidine gluconate, each formulated in alcohol. Disinfectants and skin application processes were standardized and followed published protocols. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was SSI within 30 days after abdominal surgery and within 1 year after cardiac surgery, using definitions from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network. A noninferiority margin of 2.5% was used. Secondary outcomes included SSIs stratified by depth of infection and type of surgery. RESULTS: A total of 1598 patients (26 cluster periods) were randomly assigned to receive povidone iodine vs 1762 patients (26 cluster periods) to chlorhexidine gluconate. Mean (SD) age of patients was 65.0 years (39.0-79.0) in the povidone iodine group and 65.0 years (41.0-78.0) in the chlorhexidine gluconate group. Patients were 32.7% and 33.9% female in the povidone iodine and chlorhexidine gluconate groups, respectively. SSIs were identified in 80 patients (5.1%) in the povidone iodine group vs 97 (5.5%) in the chlorhexidine gluconate group, a difference of 0.4% (95% CI, -1.1% to 2.0%) with the lower limit of the CI not exceeding the predefined noninferiority margin of -2.5%; results were similar when corrected for clustering. The unadjusted relative risk for povidone iodine vs chlorhexidine gluconate was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.69-1.23). Nonsignificant differences were observed following stratification by type of surgical procedure. In cardiac surgery, SSIs were present in 4.2% of patients with povidone iodine vs 3.3% with chlorhexidine gluconate (relative risk, 1.26 [95% CI, 0.82-1.94]); in abdominal surgery, SSIs were present in 6.8% with povidone iodine vs 9.9% with chlorhexidine gluconate (relative risk, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.46-1.02]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Povidone iodine in alcohol as preoperative skin antisepsis was noninferior to chlorhexidine gluconate in alcohol in preventing SSIs after cardiac or abdominal surgery.

"Abstract: Sunscreens contain several substances that cause damage to species where they are disposed. New formulations have been created to prevent such marine environmental damages. One promising formulation is the microencapsulated sunscreen. The objective of this study was to evaluate the possible safety to marine environment of one microencapsulated sunscreen formulation. The animal model Artemia salina (cists and nauplii) was tested with two sunscreen formulations (microencapsulated and non-microencapsulated) and toxicological, behavioral, morphological parameters as well as biochemical assays (lipoperoxidation and carbonylation tests) were analyzed. Results showed that microencapsulated sunscreen impeded some toxic effects caused by the release of the substances within the microcapsule in the highest concentration, reestablishing the mortality and hatching rates to control levels, while removing the sunscreen microcapsule by adding 1 % DMSO reduced the cyst hatching rate, increasing the nauplii mortality rate and decreased locomotor activity in higher concentrations. Finally, nauplii with 24 hours of life and exposed to sunscreen without the microcapsule showed an increase in mitochondrial activity (assessed at 48 hours after exposure) and presented malformations when exposed to the highest concentration non-microencapsulated concentration (assessed by SEM at 72 hours after exposure), when compared to the control group. These results together allow us to conclude that the microencapsulation process of a sunscreen helps protecting A. salina from the harmful effects of higher concentrations of said sunscreens. However, long-term studies must be carried out as it is not known how long a microencapsulated sunscreen can remain in the environment without causing harmful effects to the marine ecosystem and becoming an ecologically relevant pollutant.

"Abstract: Background Psoriasis is a papulosquamous disease with variable morphology, distribution, severity, and course. Chronic plaque psoriasis, or psoriasis vulgaris, is the most common form of psoriasis. Present available preparations for mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis for topical use are local corticosteroids, coal tar, dithranol, tazarotene, calcipotriol, tapinarof, and calcineurin inhibitors. However, every preparation has its disadvantages. Calcipotriol, an active form of vitamin D, is available in topical form for dermatological use. Chronic plaque psoriasis is the chief medical use of calcipotriol for mild to moderate form. Methotrexate has dramatic results in psoriasis when used systemically. Now, topical formulation is being advocated in localized psoriasis, which is not associated with the side effects of the systemic form. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effectiveness of topical calcipotriol and topical methotrexate on the basis of the psoriasis area severity index (PASI) in patients of chronic plaque psoriasis and compare their safety in terms of adverse effects. Methodology The total number of patients included in the study was 60. They were divided into two groups, with 30 patients each. One group was prescribed ointment calcipotriol 0.005% twice daily local application (Group C). The other group was prescribed methotrexate gel 1% twice daily local application (Group M). The patients were followed up on the fourth and eighth weeks, and at each time, thorough clinical examinations were conducted for all patients. The PASI score was calculated in each patient every time. Safety was assessed by biochemical parameters, and tolerability was assessed by the incidence of adverse effects. All the patients included in the study were investigated at baseline, fourth week, and eighth week. The data collected were transferred to a master chart and analyzed. Results For the patients in group C, the mean PASI score at 0 week was 5.93 ± 2.62, while at four weeks, the mean PASI score declined to 1.67 ± 1.13, and at eight weeks, the mean PASI score further declined to 0.67 ± 0.68. For the patients in group M, the mean PASI score at 0 week was 5.91 ± 2.22, while at four weeks, the mean PASI score declined to 1.91 ± 1.11, and at eight weeks, the mean PASI score further declined to 0.89 ± 0.72. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the mean PASI score at various time points when compared between the two groups (p-value = 0.761, 0.296, 0.079, respectively). Thus, both drugs seem to be effective in treating mild- to moderate-grade chronic plaque psoriasis. Most of the patients in both groups showed marked clearance of the lesions. However, there were six patients in the calcipotriol group showing complete clearance of the lesions having mild-degree plaque psoriasis, as compared to three patients in the methotrexate group. In the present study, based on the comparison of safety and tolerability, four out of 30 patients (13.3%) in the calcipotriol group suffered skin irritation, whereas six out of 30 patients (20%) in the methotrexate group complained of a burning sensation. The adverse effects seen in the patients were transient and mild. Conclusion Topical calcipotriol and methotrexate were effective in reducing lesions in patients with chronic mild to moderate plaque psoriasis. Both drugs were well tolerated with mild and transient adverse effects and did not alter hematological and biochemical parameters. "

"Abstract: The challenges in treating oral cancer include the limited effectiveness and systemic side effects of conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Hyaluronic acid (HA) based Glycyrrhizin (GL) and Methotrexate (MT) loaded localized delivery systems, specifically nanofiber (NF) based platforms, were developed to address these challenges. The electrospinning method was used for the successful fabrication of a homogenous NF membrane and characterized for morphology, drug entrapment efficiency, tensile strength, and ex-vivo mucoadhesive study. Also, it was evaluated for in-vitro drug release profile, ex-vivo drug permeability, in-vitro anti-inflammatory, apoptosis assay by MTT and flow, and against specific cell lines in order to determine their potential for therapeutic use.

"BACKGROUND: Topical clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/adapalene 0.15%/benzoyl peroxide 3.1% gel (CAB) is the first fixed-dose triple-combination approved for the treatment of acne. This post hoc analysis investigated the efficacy and safety of CAB in pediatric (&lt;18 years) and adult (greater than or equal to 18 years) participants. METHODS: In two multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 studies (NCT04214639 and NCT04214652), participants greater than or equal to 9 years of age with moderate-to-severe acne were randomized (2:1) to 12 weeks of once-daily treatment with CAB or vehicle gel. Pooled data were analyzed for pediatric and adult subpopulations. Assessments included treatment success (greater than or equal to 2-grade reduction from baseline in Evaluator's Global Severity Score and a score of 0 [clear] or 1 [almost clear], inflammatory/noninflammatory lesion counts, Acne-Specific Quality of Life (Acne-QoL) questionnaire, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and cutaneous safety/tolerability. RESULTS: At week 12, treatment success rates for both pediatric and adult participants were significantly greater with CAB (52.7%; 45.9%) than with vehicle (24.0%; 23.5%; P&lt;0.01, both). CAB-treated participants in both subgroups experienced greater reductions from baseline versus vehicle in inflammatory (pediatric: 78.6% vs 50.4%; adult: 76.6% vs 62.8%; P&lt;0.001, both) and noninflammatory lesions (pediatric: 73.8% vs 41.1%; adult: 70.7% vs 52.2%; P&lt;0.001, both). Acne-QoL improvements from baseline to week 12 were significantly greater with CAB than with a vehicle. Most TEAEs were of mild-to-moderate severity; no age-related trends for safety/tolerability were observed.&nbsp; Conclusions: CAB gel demonstrated comparable efficacy, quality of life improvements, and safety in pediatric and adult participants with moderate-to-severe acne. As the first fixed-dose, triple-combination topical formulation, CAB represents an important new treatment option for patients with acne.

"Abstract: Oral isotretinoin remains a mainstay of treatment for severe, recalcitrant nodular acne. Novel formulations of isotretinoin have been developed over the past decade, including lidose isotretinoin and micronized isotretinoin. It is important to understand the differences between isotretinoin formulations to help guide clinical decision-making and selection of isotretinoin therapy. This study aims to provide evidence-based consensus statements regarding the use of novel formulations of isotretinoin for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne. The Expert Consensus Group consisted of dermatologists with expertise in the treatment of acne. Voting members met in person to conduct a modified Delphi process; a maximum of 2 rounds of voting were conducted for each consensus statement. A total of 5 statements were generated regarding the use of novel formulations of isotretinoin, addressing the efficacy, tolerability, and side effects of novel isotretinoin formulations. All 5 statements achieved agreement with high consensus. The Expert Consensus Group agrees that individualized selection of isotretinoin therapy is important to maximize efficacy and minimize side effects. Compared to generic isotretinoin, micronized isotretinoin may require lower doses to achieve sufficient plasma concentrations. With the increased bioavailability of micronized formulation, there is no need to calculate cumulative dose; instead, the general recommendation with micronized isotretinoin is to treat for at least 5 months, or longer if needed to achieve clearance. Micronized isotretinoin can be taken in the fed or fasted state and has an acceptable safety profile. J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(6):429-432.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; doi:10.36849/JDD.7971. "
"Abstract: The field of sun protection is quickly changing and the research article by Douki et al., published in the current issue of Photochemistry and Photobiology, reported key experimental data that will certainly help the development of better sun care products. Mutagenic photoproducts (CPDs, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4PPs, pyrimidine-6-4-pyrimidone photoproducts) were formed in the reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) by UVB (312 nm) irradiation, and their concentrations were detected by HPLC-MS/MS as a function of time after the UVB treatment. RHE had been previously exposed or not (control) to blue light (427 nm). Both CPDs and 6-4PPs were shown to last longer in blue-light irradiated RHE, proving the inhibition of the DNA repair by blue light exposure. This is a highly relevant information because sunscreens allow people to enjoy longer periods under the sun and consequently, to endure very high doses of blue light. The work also reported results obtained with RHEs previously treated with a sunscreen formulation containing a broadband filter that offers blue-light protection. Interestingly, authors observed that the DNA repair was not significantly inhibited in RHE previously treated with the sunscreen offering broadband protection. Readers will find a scientifically sound proof of the importance of blue-light protection in sun care products. "

"Abstract: Effective anticancer immunity depends on properly activating multiple stepwise events in the cancer-immunity cycle. An immunologically ""cold"" tumor microenvironment (TME) engenders immune evasion and refractoriness to conventional checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Here, we combine nanoparticle formulations and an in situ formed hydrogel scaffold to treat accessible tumors locally and to stimulate systemic immunity against metastatic tumor lesions. The nanoparticles encapsulate poly(ε-caprolactone)-derived cytotoxic chemotherapy and adjuvant of Toll-like receptor 7/8 through a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-cleavable linker that can be self-activated by the coassembled neighboring photosensitizer following near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation. Further development results in syringeable, NIR light-responsive, and immunogenic hydrogel (iGEL) that can be implanted peritumorally and deposited into the tumor surgical bed. Upon NIR laser irradiation, the generated ROS induces iGEL degradation and bond cleavage in the polymer-drug conjugates, triggering the immunogenic cell death cascade in cancer cells and spontaneously releasing encapsulated agents to rewire the cancer-immunity cycle. Notably, upon application in multiple preclinical models of melanoma and triple-negative breast cancer, which are aggressive and refractory to conventional immunotherapy, iGEL induces durable remission of established tumors, extends postsurgical tumor-free survival, and inhibits metastatic burden. The result of this study is a locally administrable immunogenic hydrogel for triggering host systemic immunity to improve immunotherapeutic efficacy with minimal off-target side effects. "
"Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have the potential to serve as delivery systems for medicinal substances and gene treatments, particularly in cancer treatment. Co-delivery of curcumin (CUR) and Methotrexate (MTX) has shown promise in cancer treatment, as it uses fewer drugs and has fewer side effects. This study used MTX-conjugated albumin (BSA)-based nanoparticles (BSA-MTX) to enhance and assess the efficiency of CUR. In-vitro cytotoxicity tests, DLS, TEM, FTIR, UV/Vis, SEM, and DSC studies assessed the formulations' physical and chemical properties. The Proteinase K enzyme was used to severe amidic linkages between MTX and BSA. The findings demonstrated the efficacy of using ƒ-MWCNT-CUR-BSA-MTX as a vehicle for efficient co-delivery of CUR and MTX in cancer treatment. The MTT colorimetric method was used to evaluate the effect of chemical and medicinal compounds. Cell division was studied using the MTT method to investigate the effect of pure MWCNT, pure CUR, MTX-BSA, and ƒ-MWCNT-CUR-MTX-BSA. Studies on cell lines have shown that the combination of curcumin and MTX with CNT can increase and improve the effectiveness of both drugs against cancer. A combination of drugs curcumin and methotrexate simultaneously had a synergistic effect on MCF-7 cells, which indicated that these drugs could potentially be used as a strategy for both prevention and treatment of breast cancer. Also, ƒ-MWCNT-CUR-MTX-BSA was found to have a significant effect on cancer treatment with minimal toxicity compared to pure curcumin, pure MTX-BSA, MTX, and ƒ-MWCNT alone. Unique properties such as a high ratio of specific surface area to volume, high chemical stability, chemical adsorption ability, high capacity of drug and biomolecules of carbon nanotubes, as well as multiple drug loading at the same time The combination of ƒ-MWCNT-CUR-BSA MTX significantly impacts cancer therapy), are desirable as an alternative option for targeted drug delivery and high therapeutic efficiency.

"BACKGROUND & AIMS: CT-P13 subcutaneous (SC), an SC formulation of the intravenous (IV) infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 IV, creates a unique exposure profile. The LIBERTY studies aimed to demonstrate superiority of CT-P13 SC vs placebo as maintenance therapy in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies were conducted in patients with moderately to severely active CD or UC and inadequate response or intolerance to corticosteroids and immunomodulators. All patients received open-label CT-P13 IV 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6. At week 10, clinical responders were randomized (2:1) to CT-P13 SC 120 mg or placebo every 2 weeks until week 54 (maintenance phase) using prefilled syringes. (Co-) primary end points were clinical remission and endoscopic response (CD) and clinical remission (UC) at week 54 (all-randomized population). RESULTS: Overall, 396 patients with CD and 548 patients with UC received induction treatment. At week 54 in the CD study, statistically significant higher proportions of CT-P13 SC-treated patients vs placebo-treated patients achieved clinical remission (62.3% vs 32.1%; P < .0001) and endoscopic response (51.1% vs 17.9%; P < .0001). In the UC study, clinical remission rates at week 54 were statistically significantly higher with CT-P13 SC vs placebo (43.2% vs 20.8%; P < .0001). Achievement of key secondary end points was significantly higher with CT-P13 SC vs placebo across both studies. CT-P13 SC was well tolerated, with no new safety signals identified. CONCLUSIONS: CT-P13 SC was more effective than placebo as maintenance therapy and was well tolerated in patients with moderately to severely active CD or UC who responded to CT-P13 IV induction. CLINICALTRIALS: gov, Numbers: NCT03945019 (CD) and NCT04205643 (UC). "
"Abstract: With the rapid development of nanotechnology, various functional nanomaterials have shown exciting potential in biomedical areas such as drug delivery, antitumor, and antibacterial therapy. These nanomaterials improve the stability and selectivity of loaded drugs, reduce drug-induced side effects, realize controlled and targeted drug release, and increase therapeutic efficacy. The increased resistance to antifungal microbicides in medical practice and their side effects stimulate interest in new therapies, such as Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), which do not generate resistance in microorganisms and effectively control the pathology. The present study aimed to evaluate, in vitro, the efficacy of photodynamic therapy on Candida albicans using 1,9-Dimethyl-Methylene Blue (DMMB) as photosensitizer, red LED (λ630), and nanoencapsulation of DMMB (RL-NPs/DMMB) using rhamnolipids produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa to evaluate if there is better performance of DMMB + RL particles compared to DMMB alone via the characterization of DMMB + RL and colony forming count. The tests were carried out across six experimental groups (Control, DMMB, RL-NPs, RL-NPs/DMMB, PDT and PDT + RL-NPs/DMMB) using in the groups with nanoparticles, DMMB (750 ng/mL) encapsulated with rhamnolipids in a 1:1 ratio, the light source consisted of a prototype built with a set of red LEDs with an energy density of 20 J/cm "
"INTRODUCTION: Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is a promising, minimally invasive treatment for cancer with high immunostimulatory potential, no reported drug resistance, and reduced side effects. Indocyanine Green (ICG) has been used as a photosensitizer (PS) for PDT, although its poor stability and low tumor-target specificity strongly limit its efficacy. To overcome these limitations, ICG can be formulated as a tumor-targeting nanoparticle (NP). METHODS: We nanoformulated ICG into recombinant heavy-ferritin nanocages (HFn-ICG). HFn has a specific interaction with transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which is overexpressed in most tumors, thus increasing HFn tumor tropism. First, we tested the properties of HFn-ICG as a PS upon irradiation with a continuous-wave diode laser. Then, we evaluated PDT efficacy in two breast cancer (BC) cell lines with different TfR1 expression levels. Finally, we measured the levels of intracellular endogenous heavy ferritin (H-Fn) after PDT treatment. In fact, it is known that cells undergoing ROS-induced autophagy, as in PDT, tend to increase their ferritin levels as a defence mechanism. By measuring intracellular H-Fn, we verified whether this interplay between internalized HFn and endogenous H-Fn could be used to maximize HFn uptake and PDT efficacy. RESULTS: We previously demonstrated that HFn-ICG stabilized ICG molecules and increased their delivery to the target site in vitro and in vivo for fluorescence guided surgery. Here, with the aim of using HFn-ICG for PDT, we showed that HFn-ICG improved treatment efficacy in BC cells, depending on their TfR1 expression. Our data revealed that endogenous H-Fn levels were increased after PDT treatment, suggesting that this defence reaction against oxidative stress could be used to enhance HFn-ICG uptake in cells, increasing treatment efficacy. CONCLUSION: The strong PDT efficacy and peculiar Trojan horse-like mechanism, that we revealed for the first time in literature, confirmed the promising application of HFn-ICG in PDT. "
Abstract: Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have garnered significant interest due to their distinctive properties and potential applications. Traditional fabrication methods for nanoparticles often involve high-energy physical conditions and the use of toxic solvents. Various green synthesis approaches have been developed to circumvent these issues and produce environmentally benign nanoparticles. Our study focuses on the green synthesis of AgNPs using L-ascorbic acid and explores the modification of their properties to enhance antibacterial and anticancer effects. This is achieved by coating the nanoparticles with Zinc oxide (ZnO) and Silica oxide (SiO 
"BACKGROUND: As exposure to UV radiation is the primary modifiable environmental risk factor associated with skin cancer, it remains the principal focus of most prevention strategies. Numerous sun protection campaigns have been implemented worldwide; however, their impact on the actual incidence and mortality rates of skin cancer seems to be limited. To create successful skin cancer prevention campaigns, it is important to have a comprehensive understanding of individuals' attitudes and behaviours regarding sun protection. The aim of the current study was to determine and report on the prevalence of self-reported attitudes, knowledge and behaviours regarding two of the major sun protection recommendations-avoidance of sun exposure and use of sunscreens-in an international representative sample across five continents. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 20 countries using a web-based online survey. FINDINGS: A total of 50,552 individuals, comprising 25,388 men (50.22%) and 25,164 women (49.78%), participated in the survey. Among them, 83.2% reported having been voluntarily exposed to the sun (for sun-basking reasons) at least once in the last 12 months, and 47.96% acknowledged being exposed to the sun between the hours of 10 AM and 4 PM. The primary reason for non-adherence was that these hours were the most convenient times (32.28%). Only 24.05% reported applying sunscreen every 2 h when outdoors. Forgetfulness was the primary reason as provided by 27.79% of participants. Males and older age groups were less likely to adopt sun-protective behaviours around the world. Forgetfulness and the challenges posed by time constraints seem to be the biggest barriers to proper adherence. INTERPRETATION: These findings should prompt the collaboration with health authorities and the manufacturers to enhance adherence by setting reasonable sunscreen prices and creating formulations that make their application less burdensome.

"UNLABELLED: Chrysoeriol is an active ingredient derived from the Chinese medicinal herb (CMH) "" METHODS: Nine electronic databases were searched, including WanFang Data, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, Springer Link, SciFinder, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), without regard to language constraints. The pharmacological activities of chrysoeriol from  RESULTS: Chrysoeriol decreased the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α. These were transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB and STAT3 to combat skin inflammation. It also showed promising actions in treating many skin ailments including wound healing, depigmentation, photoprotection, and antiaging. CONCLUSION: The cutaneous route is the best delivery approach to chrysoeriol across the skin barrier. However, toxicity, dosage, and safety assessments of chrysoeriol in a formulation or nanochrysoeriol on the human epidermis for application in skin diseases must be further investigated. "
"Abstract: Extended-release formulations of buprenorphine offer less frequent dosing, provide consistent medication delivery, and improve adherence for treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD). Although buprenorphine is a partial agonist with seemingly less precipitated withdrawal and easier initiation than full opioid agonists used for OUD, its use is not benign and understanding of the different extended-release formulations is necessary. We report a case of a patient that received a long-acting buprenorphine formulation (Sublocade®) administered subcutaneously that presented to the emergency department with tachycardia, hyperglycemia, elevated anion gap, and sustained nausea and vomiting refractory to pharmacotherapy requiring surgical removal of the buprenorphine depot for resolution of nausea and vomiting symptoms.

"Abstract: Glycolic acid (GA) is extensively used in cosmetic formulations and skin peeling treatments but its adverse effects, notably severe disruption of epidermal structure, limit its clinical utility. However, the detailed impact of GA on epidermal homeostasis, including changes in structure and protein expression over time, is not fully understood. This study employed a reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) model to assess the effects of varying GA concentrations on epidermal proliferation, differentiation, and desquamation at different time points. Through histology, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry, we observed that 35% GA concentration adversely caused abnormal epidermal homeostasis by affecting epidermal proliferation, differentiation and desquamation. Our findings reveal time-specific responses of key proteins to GA: Filaggrin, Involucrin, Loricrin, and Ki67 showed very early responses; KLK10 an early response; and AQP3 and K10 late responses. This research provides a detailed characterization of GA's effects in an RHE model, mimicking clinical superficial peeling and identifying optimal times for detecting GA-induced changes. Our results offer insights for designing interventions to mitigate GA's adverse effects on skin, enhancing the safety and efficacy of GA peeling treatments. "
"OBJECTIVE: &nbsp; This study aimed to investigate the ultraviolet (UV) protection/repair benefits of a patented Amino Acid Complex (AAComplex). METHODS: I) AAComplex was incubated with dermal fibroblasts, with/without UVA, and collagen I was measured with a GlasBoxPlus device. II) A lotion, with/without AAComplex (1%) was applied topically to skin explants, following UVA irradiation, and quantified for health-related biomarkers (TNFalpha, histamine, and MMP-1). III) A broad spectrum sunscreen with SPF 46 and a skincare serum containing AAComplex (2%) were assessed using epidermal equivalents, in the presence of UV irradiation, for effects on IL-1alpha, thymine dimers, Ki-67, filaggrin and Nrf2. RESULTS: I) Collagen I synthesis in dermal fibroblasts was significantly decreased after UVA compared to without UV. The presence of AAComplex prevented this decrease. II) UVA irradiation of skin explants increased histamine, TNF&alpha;, and MMP-1. Hydrocortisone aceponate cream significantly decreases all 3 biomarkers. AAComplex contained lotion also significantly decreased all 3 biomarkers, the no AAComplex control lotion only reduced histamine. III) With the regimen of sunscreen + AAComplex contained skincare serum, the significant reduction in IL-1alpha was observed along with a complete recovery of Ki-67 and stimulation of filaggrin and Nrf2T. No thymine dimer positive cell was observed indicating the most positive skin impact from the regiment.&nbsp; Conclusion: This research using different human skin models demonstrated that AAComplex can provide protection and damage repair caused by UV, at the ingredient level also when formulated in a serum or lotion formula. Skin may be best protected from UV damage when the regimen is used.&nbsp;&nbsp; J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(5):366-375. doi:10.36849/JDD.7916. "
"BACKGROUND: Peer-reviewed, clinical studies measuring the efficacy and usability of skin care products enhance their integrity and may guide experts in the field in providing recommendations. A single-blind, prospective clinical study was designed to assess the subject satisfaction, clinical benefit, and safety of three photodynamic topical formulations referred to as MMSRepose (MMSRep), MMSRevive (MMSRev), and MMSBalance (MMSB).&nbsp; Methods: Thirteen male and female patients (mean age 49&nbsp;+/- 17.8 years) applied one of the three topical serums twice daily over a period of 12 weeks. Subjects returned for photography, and blinded investigator evaluation of rhytides (fine lines) and dyspigmentation were measured on a 6- and 4-point scale, respectively. Patient-perceived efficacy of multiple clinical outcomes was measured on a 5-point scale.&nbsp; Results: 100% of subjects reported at least a 1-grade improvement in global aesthetic at the conclusion of the study. Investigator assessment revealed an overall 53.3% decrease in rhytides, correlating to a mean point reduction from 1.65 +/- 0.77 to 0.77&nbsp;+/- 0.53 (P&lt;0.001) from baseline to week 12. Investigator assessment of dyspigmentation revealed a 62.7% decrease, correlating to a mean point reduction of 1.85 +/- 0.68 from week 1 to 0.69&nbsp;+/- 0.48 at week 12 (P&lt;0.001). CONCLUSION: Photodynamic serums demonstrate clinical efficacy in skin rejuvenation and high user satisfaction. There were no serious adverse events. This study is limited by the inability to randomize to placebo due to the small sample size, as subject retention was heavily impacted by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Future studies may be indicated to undergo comparison with a larger cohort.&nbsp; J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(5):332-337. doi:10.36849/JDD.7167. "
"Abstract: With the emergence of drug-resistance, there is a need for novel anti-bacterials or to enhance the efficacy of existing drugs. In this study, Patuletin (PA), a flavanoid was loaded onto Gallic acid modified Zinc oxide nanoparticles (PA-GA-ZnO), and evaluated for antibacterial properties against Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Gram-negative (Samonella enterica and Escherichia coli) bacteria. Characterization of PA, GA-ZnO and PA-GA-ZnO' nanoparticles was accomplished utilizing fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, efficiency of drug entrapment, polydispersity index, zeta potential, size, and surface morphology analysis through atomic force microscopy. Using bactericidal assays, the results revealed that ZnO conjugation displayed remarkable effects and enhanced Patuletin's effects against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with the minimum inhibitory concentration observed at micromolar concentrations. Cytopathogenicity assays exhibited that the drug-nanoconjugates reduced bacterial-mediated human cell death with minimal side effects to human cells. When tested alone, drug-nanoconjugates tested in this study showed limited toxic effects against human cells in vitro. These are promising findings, but future work is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms of effects of drug-nanoconjugates against bacterial pathogens, in addition to in vivo testing to determine their translational value. This study suggests that Patuletin-loaded nano-formulation (PA-GA-ZnO) may be implicated in a multi-target mechanism that affects both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogen cell structures, however this needs to be ascertained in future work.

"Abstract: Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a major contributor to skin aging, cancer, and other detrimental health effects. Sunscreens containing FDA-approved UV filters, like avobenzone, offer protection but suffer from photodegradation and potential phototoxicity. Encapsulation, antioxidants, and photostabilizers are strategies employed to combat these drawbacks. Octocrylene, an organic UV filter, utilizes nanotechnology to enhance sun protection factor (SPF). This review examines recent literature on octocrylene-enriched sunscreens, exploring the interplay between environmental impact, nanotechnological advancements, and clinical trial insights. A critical focus is placed on the environmental consequences of sunscreen use, particularly the potential hazards UV filters pose to marine ecosystems. Research in the Mediterranean Sea suggests bacterial sensitivity to these filters, raising concerns about their integration into the food chain. This review aims to guide researchers in developing effective strategies for photostabilization of UV filters. By combining encapsulation, photostabilizers, and antioxidants, researchers can potentially reduce phototoxic effects and contribute to developing more environmentally friendly sunscreens. "
"Abstract: Background Treating dermatological pathologies under occlusion therapy is a popular adjunct, especially in thickened, lichenified areas of psoriasis where sustained contact with topical corticosteroids plays a pivotal role. Film-forming spray (FFS) can be a novel, alternate approach along with topical treatment in this area for carefully selected cases. This study aimed to evaluate the safety profile and physical characteristics of a novel formulation of an FFS in patients with psoriasis and eczema.  Methods This open-label, multicentre, comparative study included subjects diagnosed with chronic plaque psoriasis requiring topical corticosteroid therapy or those with eczema necessitating its application and occlusion therapy. The study product was applied to two groups of subjects. For patients in group 1, the FFS was applied to the skin area affected by the dermatological condition, which was covered with ointment only. In the second group, the FFS was applied to the corresponding unaffected skin area. The FFS was applied for 60-90 seconds and was observed for two hours after the application. The subjects were evaluated for primary outcomes, including safety assessment, overall physical characteristics, and appearance of FFS from local skin effects. The secondary outcomes included physical appearance characteristics and overall patient satisfaction following the application of FFS at the target sites. Further statistical assessments were conducted using the SAS software version 9.4 (2023; SAS Institute Inc "
"PURPOSE: To report a case of corneal endothelial damage caused by alcohol-containing chlorhexidine gluconate (CG-A) and its progression over time. METHODS: This was a case report. RESULTS: A 22-year-old man underwent neurosurgery under general anesthesia. CG-A (1%) was used for disinfection after the application of corneal protection tape. Postoperatively, the patient presented with hyperemia and swelling of the left conjunctiva and was referred to our department. Initial examination revealed left corneal epithelial erosion and corneal edema, which improved on postoperative day 14. The corneal endothelial cell density (ECD) was 3,345 cells/mm 2 on day 14, decreased rapidly to 2,090 cells/mm 2 on day 42, and slowly reduced to 1,122 cells/mm 2 on day 168. Thereafter, no decrease in ECD was observed. CONCLUSIONS: CG formulations can lead to a persistent decrease in ECD over several months, even after improvement of acute corneal edema. "
"BACKGROUND: Subcutaneous [SC] infliximab may provide multiple benefits over intravenous [IV] formulations. However, studies for efficacy and safety in inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] have been constrained by small sizes that limit the interpretation of outcomes, particularly for subgroups potentially at high risk of disease relapse. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and random-effects meta-analysis up to January 2023, to evaluate the change in clinical remission after transitioning from IV to SC infliximab in patients with IBD in clinical remission. The primary outcome was measured using the relative risk for meta-analysis. RESULTS: We identified 15 studies of patients established ≥ 3 months on IV infliximab, consisting of 1371 patients and 840 patient-years of follow-up. There was no loss of clinical remission in the IBD cohort overall, Crohn's disease [CD], or perianal CD [p = 0.55 and p = 0.11 at 9-12 months, and p = 0.50 at 6 months, respectively]. Neither prior IV dose [≤ 10 mg/kg 6-weekly] [p = 0.48] nor IBD disease subtype was associated with an increased clinical relapse rate at 6 months (p = 0.48 and p = 0.45 [UC vs CD], respectively). CONCLUSION: Changing patients established on IV infliximab to an SC formulation is associated with a high ongoing clinical remission and a low adverse event rate. Furthermore, there are no signals for adverse outcomes among different IBD disease subtypes, nor in those on escalated IV infliximab dosing schedules up to 10 mg/kg 6-weekly. These data should provide patients and clinicians alike with confidence in SC infliximab use in IBD. "
"BACKGROUND: Fresh Menthol 3% Nicotine (FM3) is a novel JUUL e-liquid formulation. Its potential toxicity and that of the corresponding base formulation relative to a filtered air (FA) control was studied in a subchronic inhalation study conducted in general accordance with OECD 413. METHODS: Aerosols generated with an intense puffing regime were administered to rats in a nose-only fashion at 1400 µg aerosol collected mass/L on a 6 hour/day basis for 90 days with a 42-day recovery. Exposure atmospheres met target criteria. Systemic exposure was confirmed by plasma measurement of nicotine. RESULTS: No test article-related mortality, clinical signs (other than reversible lower body weight gains in males), clinical pathology or gross findings were noted during this study. No microscopic lesions related to base formulation exposure were identified. Minimal microscopic lesions were observed in the FM3 6-hour exposure group. Microscopic lesions observed in the FM3 6-hour exposure group comprised only minimal laryngeal squamous metaplasia in one male and one female animal. No microscopic lesions related to FM3 exposure remained after the recovery period. CONCLUSION: Exposure atmosphere characterization indicated that conditions were achieved to permit thorough assessment of test articles and results indicate a low order of toxicity for the FM3 Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) formulation and its base formulation.

"Abstract: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) often have one or more painfuljoints despite adequate medicine. Local drug delivery to the synovial cavity bids for high drug concentration with minimal systemic adverse effects. However, anti-RA drugs show short half-lives in inflamed joints after intra-articular delivery. To improve the therapeutic efficacy, it is essential to ensure that a drug is only released from the formulation when it is needed. In this work, we developed an intelligent ""Self-actuating"" drug delivery system where Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic Drug (DMARD) methotrexate is incorporated within a matrix intended to be injected directly into joints. This formulation has the property to sense the need and release medication only when joints are inflamed in response to inflammatory enzyme Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). These enzymes are important proteases in RA pathology, and several MMP are present in augmented levels in synovial fluid and tissues. A high level of MMP present in synovial tissues of RA patients would facilitate the release of drugs in response and ascertain controlled drug release. The formulation is designed to be stable within the joint environment, but to dis-assemble in response to inflammation. The synthesized enzyme-responsive methotrexate (Mtx) encapsulated micron-sized polymer-lipid hybrid hydrogel microspheres (Mtx-PLHM) was physiochemically characterized and tested in synovial fluid, Human Fibroblast like synoviocytes (h-FLS) (derived from RA patients) and a rat arthritic animal model. Mtx-PLHM can self-actuate and augment the release of Mtx drug upon contact with either exogenously added MMP or endogenous MMP present in the synovial fluid of patients with RA. The drug release from the prepared formulation is significantly amplified to several folds in the presence of MMP-2 and MMP-9 enzymes. In the rat arthritic model, Mtx-PLHM showed promising therapeutic results with the significant alleviation of RA symptoms through decrease in joint inflammation, swelling, bone erosion, and joint damage examined by X-ray analysis, histopathology and immune-histology. This drug delivery system would be nontoxic as it releases more drug only during the period of exacerbation of inflammation. This will simultaneously protect patients from unwanted side effects when the disease is inactive and lower the need for repeated joint injections. "
"Abstract: Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are known as suitable material to be applied in different fields such as photodynamic therapy (PDT). Herein, GQDs were synthesized by the pyrolysis method and then decorated with selenium (Se). Afterward, they were combined with methylene blue (MB) to increase singlet oxygen generation as well as to apply them more effectively in the PDT method. Furthermore, GQDs were investigated by transmission electron microscope (TEM), photoluminescence spectrum (PL), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurement, and cytotoxicity measurement. GQDs showed no dependence on the excitation wavelength. The result of ROS measurement proves that the combination of GQD-Se and MB increases singlet oxygen production. Moreover, afterglow measurement approved the beneficial effect of GQD-Se on even deep and near skin tumor treatment. Cytotoxicity measurements under dark conditions, cell viability, and the side effects on human cells were determined by (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) (MTT) assay. Our findings show that under dark conditions, even high concentrations of nanoparticles have no significant effect on cell viability. These findings and the high biocompatibility of GQDs indicate the effective application of GQD-Se-MB in PDT. "
"Abstract: The TRPV1 receptor, which is known to contribute significantly to pain perception, has recently been identified as a useful tool for predicting eye stinging potential in cosmetics. In this study, HEK-293 cells with high TRPV1 expression were utilized to evaluate calcium influx related to receptor activation triggered by chemicals and cosmetic formulations. The cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of substances to cause or not some aggression to the eye, and TRPV1 activity was assessed by measuring intracellular FURA-2 AM fluorescence signal. To confirm TRPV1 channel activation, capsazepine, a capsaicin antagonist, was employed in addition to using capsaicin as a positive control. The study's results indicate that this novel model can identify compounds known to cause some aggression to the eye, such as stinging, considering a cut-off value of 60% of Ca "
"Abstract: Synthetic sunscreen offers protection against excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun, and protects the skin from possible damage. However, they have low efficacy against the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are highly reactive molecules that can be generated in the skin when it is exposed to UV radiation, and are known to play a role in oxidative stress, which can contribute to skin aging and damage. Thus, there is an ongoing search for sunscreens that do not have these negative effects. One promising source for these is natural products. Therefore, the current patent review summarizes topical formulations made from natural compounds that have antioxidant properties and can be used as photoprotective or anti-aging agents, either using a single natural extract or a combination of extracts. The review reports basic patent information (applicant country, type of applicant, and year of filing) and gives details about the invention, including its chemical composition, and the in vitro and in vivo tests performed. These patents describe natural products that can be used to protect the skin and validate their efficacy, and safety, in addition to standardizing their formulations. The compositions described illustrate the consistent innovation in the use of natural products to protect against UV damage and photoaging disorders, a promising field which is receiving growing global recognition.

"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study of sun protection factor boosting effect sunscreen compositions with herbal extract and combination with octocrylene. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The standardized herbal extracts procured and studied their sun protection Factors. Camellia Sinensis (Green tea) leaf Extract, Eclipta prostrata (bhringraj) leaf extract are selected for the development of the herbal sunscreen composition along with octocrylene as synthetic sunscreen. The developed sunscreen composition contains defined concentration of herbal extracts and octocrylene were evaluated for their different physicochemical properties and stability. Sun protection factor boosting effect of herbal extracts is studied combination with octocrylene. RESULTS: Invitro SPF studied for herbal extract individually and combination with octocrylene. The results of Invitro SPF study revealed the presence of green tea extract and, Eclipta prostrata (bhringraj) leaf extract shows excellent sun protection factor (SPF) boosting value of sunscreen composition containing 5% concentration of herbal extract and octocrylene. The sunscreen formulation containing 5% herbal extracts are stable for 12 weeks in an oven (45 °C). CONCLUSION: The findings of this in-vitro SPF study revealed a sun protection boosting capacity of green tea extract and bhringraj extract confirmed. SUMMARY: The over exposure of human skin to Ultra-Violet Radiation (UVR) can trigger photodamage, UV burn, pigmentation, erythema, and enhance the chance of dermal carcinoma. UVR causes DNA damage, which leads to dermal cancer. Daily sunscreens protect the skin from the adverse effects of sun rays, especially UVB (290-320 nm) and UVA (320-400 nm). The ozone layer filters UVC (200-290 nm) radiation when it enters into atmosphere of the earth. UVB causes sunburn, photo damage and cause mutagenic changes in nucleic acids. UVA increases ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) accumulation. ROS is responsible for cell repair which leads to carcinogenesis, and the cause of photodamage. Herbal extracts contain polyphenols, and flavonoids act as a natural sunscreen that will filter Ultra-Violet (UVB) light and contain antioxidant characteristics to modulate the photo-oxidative damage that results from UV-induced Reactive Oxygen Species production. The UVR protection of most herbal extracts are required to attain the higher UV protection in the sun care products. The approaches for preparing sun care products with higher Sun Protection Factor (SPF) possible through Oil in water formulation with herbal extract combinations of octocrylene. The developed sunscreen composition containing different concentration of herbal extracts were evaluated for their other physicochemical properties and stability. Invitro SPF was studied for Camellia Sinensis (Green tea) Leaf Extract and Eclipta prostrata (bhringraj) leaf extract individually and in combination with octocrylene. The results of the Invitro SPF study revealed the Camellia Sinensis (Green tea) Leaf Extract with octocrylene shows better Sun protection factor than Eclipta prostrata (bhringraj) leaf extract with octocrylene. The Sun Protection Factor (SPF) enhancement value of sunscreen compositions was compared to both sunscreen macroemulsion and nanoemulsion. "
"Abstract: Alopecia is a chronic dermatological disorder that affects patients worldwide, with a significant impact on quality of life, self-esteem, and psychological wellbeing. However, commercially available options for alopecia treatment are still limited. Considering that topical formulations have a long-term use therapeutic profile, the safety of their ingredients should be closely evaluated to avoid potentially irritant substances. Alternative active ingredients with different mechanisms of action, as well as adequate vehicles, might increase patients' adherence leading to better clinical outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine the irritation, skin sensitization, photoallergy, and phototoxicity potential of a line of ready-to-use vehicles for producing topical therapies for alopecia treatments, TrichoConcept™. Subjects were selected and randomly assigned to compare the patch test with the study products or to the control solution (sterile 0.9% NaCl solution). No clinical signs of irritation, sensitization, photoallergy or phototoxicity were reported. From the results of this study, it is suggested that the investigated products can be considered safe under the evaluated conditions, and the claims ""dermatologically tested"", ""clinically tested"", and ""nonirritant"" can be supported.

"Abstract: Scabies is considered an external parasite notorious for its high prevalence causing severe and contagious skin lesions in humans and animals worldwide. This study has introduced a medicine to treat dogs infested with scabies (variants of Demodex, Sarcoptes, Psoroptes, Otodectes, etc.). The present study offers a no-side-effect herbal formulation to treat dogs infested with scabies. Unlike oral and injectable medicines, which take the form of an ointment and are topically applied on-site, this medicinal formulation can be easily used without concerns over its side effects or consumption dosages. This medicinal formulation requires no skin rinsing due to its herbal and high skin absorption properties, as recovery may take less than a month with a maximum of two times of application. To carry out the experiment, 25 sick dogs with various breeds and ages suspected of scabies were gathered. Following accurate morphological examinations of all the samples, a deep skin chip of the lesion site was provided, which was examined by a microscope. Then, 13 dogs (Mix, Terrier, Pug, Husky, Spitz) were infested with Demodex scabies and 12 dogs (Pittbull, Mix, Shih Tzu, Terrier, Boxer, Setter) with Sarcoptic scabies. The prepared product was topically administered at a constant 2% dosage to the bodies of all the samples. To prepare the ointment, 1 g of Borax (Na "
"INTRODUCTION: Chronic exposure to ultraviolet light photoages skin. Retinol, a precursor molecule to retinoic acid that causes less irritation, is available as a nonprescription, cosmetic retinoid and improves collagen production, skin elasticity, and signs of photoaging. Advances in formulation science have allowed the production of stabilized bioactive retinol formulations. This integrated analysis aims to build on previous studies and further examine the comprehensive efficacy and tolerability of topical 0.1% stabilized bioactive retinol. METHODS: This analysis included 6 vehicle-controlled studies of 0.1% stabilized bioactive retinol in women with mild-to-moderate signs of photodamage. Across all studies, the same dermatologist investigator assessed overall photodamage; wrinkles on the forehead, cheeks, and undereye area; crow&rsquo;s feet wrinkles and fine lines; lack of even skin tone; and brown spots at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12 on a numerical scale. Tolerability was also assessed. RESULTS: Participants (retinol, N=237; vehicle, N=234) had a mean (SD) age of 47.4 (6.6) years. Retinol induced greater improvements from baseline in all signs of photoaging vs vehicle as early as week 4 and through 12 weeks of application. Few participants experienced irritation; all events were mild to moderate and transient. The most common signs of irritation were erythema (n=2) and skin scaling/peeling (n=5). CONCLUSIONS: This pooled analysis of 6 vehicle-controlled clinical studies provides new evidence for the efficacy of 0.1% stabilized bioactive retinol in improving signs of photoaging without causing major irritation. Topical 0.1% stabilized bioactive retinol was well tolerated with only a few reported cases of skin irritation. J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23(4):&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;doi:10.36849/JDD.8124. "
"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a therapeutic option for low-risk basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of topical PDT in the treatment of superficial BCC (sBCC) using two different photosensitizers: aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride (ALA-HCl) in a gel formulation with a lipid nanoemulsion (ALA-HCl in gel) and ALA methyl ester hydrochloride (MAL-HCl) in a cream formulation (MAL-HCl in cream). MATERIAL AND METHODS: 21 patients were treated twice with a one week interval between treatments. The formulations were applied onto lesions: 10 patients were treated with MAL-HCl in cream, and 11 with ALA-HCl in gel. After three hours of incubation and removing the preparations, fluorescence was assessed. The skin areas were then irradiated with red light 630 ± 5 nm. RESULTS: At the follow-up visit 12 weeks after the second treatment, complete clinical remission was found in 82% after ALA-HCl in gel and in 80% after MAL-HCl in cream. An excellent cosmetic result was found in 96% of patients after MALHCl in cream and in 100% after ALA-HCl in gel. Faster skin healing and less post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation during follow-up visits was observed after treatment with ALA-HCl in gel. CONCLUSIONS: Both formulations - ALA-HCl in gel and MAL-HCl in cream - were highly effective photosensitisers for PDT. The advantage of ALA-HCl in a gel formulation with a lipid nanoemulsion was faster skin healing, resulting in better cosmetic results. "
"Abstract: Thymoquinone (TQ) is a phytochemical compound present in Nigella sativa and has potential benefits for treating dermatological conditions such as psoriasis. However, its clinical use is limited due to its restricted bioavailability, caused mainly by its low solubility and permeability. To overcome this, a new transdermal drug delivery system is required. Nanoparticles are known to enhance material solubility and permeability, and hence, this study aimed to synthesize TQ-loaded L-arginine-based polyamide (TQ/Arg PA) nanocapsules incorporated into transdermal patches for prolonged delivery of TQ. To achieve this, Eudragit E polymer, plasticizers, and aloe vera as penetration enhancer were used to develop the transdermal patch. Furthermore, novel TQ/Arg-PA was synthesized via interfacial polymerization, and the resultant nanocapsules (NCs) were incorporated into the matrix transdermal patch. The Arg-PA NCs' structure was confirmed via NMR and FTIR, and optimal TQ/Arg-PA NCs containing formulation showed high entrapment efficiency of TQ (99.60%). Molecular and thermal profiling of TQ/Arg-PA and the transdermal patch revealed the effective development of spherical NCs with an average particle size of 129.23 ± 18.22 nm. Using Franz diffusion cells and synthetic membrane (STRAT M®), the in vitro permeation profile of the prepared patches demonstrated an extended release of TQ over 24 h, with enhanced permeation by 42.64% when aloe vera was employed. In conclusion, the produced formulation has a potential substitute for corticosteroids and other drugs commonly used to treat psoriasis due to its effectiveness, safety, and lack of the side effects typically associated with other drugs.

"PURPOSE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease that attacks human joints. Methotrexate (MTX), as one the most effective medications to treat RA, has limitations when administered either orally or by injection. To overcome this limitation, we formulated MTX through a smart nanoparticle (SNP) combined with dissolving microarray patch (DMAP) to achieve selective-targeted delivery of RA. METHODS: SNP was made using the combination of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polycaprolactone (PCL) polymers, while DMAP was made using the combination of hyaluronic acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone K-30. SNP-DMAP was then evaluated for its mechanical and chemical characteristics, ex vivo permeation test, in vivo pharmacokinetic study, hemolysis, and hen's egg test-chorioallantoic membrane (HET-CAM) test. RESULT: The results showed that the characteristics of the SNP-DMAP-MTX formulas meet the requirements for transdermal delivery, with the particle size of 189.09 ±12.30 nm and absorption efficiency of 65.40 ± 5.0%. The hemolysis and HET-CAM testing indicate that this formula was non-toxic and non-irritating. Ex vivo permeation shows a concentration of 51.50 ± 3.20 µg/mL of SNP-DMAP-MTX in PBS pH 5.0. The pharmacokinetic profile of SNP-DMAP-MTX showed selectivity and sustained release compared with oral and DMAP-MTX with values of t CONCLUSION: The developed SNP-DMAP-MTX has been proven to deliver MTX transdermal and selectively at the RA site, potentially avoiding conventional MTX side effects and enhancing the effectiveness of RA therapy.

"Abstract: The incorporation of polymers into drug delivery vehicles has been shown to be a useful approach to prolong the residence time of drugs in the precorneal tear film and to improve penetration into biological membranes. The main objective of this research was to formulate novel viscous eye drops with ketotifen as the active ingredient, containing the polysaccharides: chitosan (MCH), hydroxypropyl guar gum (HPG) and hyaluronic acid (SH) alone and in combination as functional polymers. DSC and FT-IR techniques showed the compatibility between ketotifen and polymers. Physicochemical and rheological analysis at ambient and simulated physiological conditions, as well as the evaluation of mucoadhesive properties showed that vehicles containing combinations of polymers have suitable physicochemical and functional properties with demonstrated synergism between combined polymers (MCH and HPG i.e. SH and HPG). The drug permeability was successfully estimated in vitro using HCE-T cell-based models. MTT cytotoxicity assay demonstrates that the tested formulations were non-toxic and well tolerated. In vivo preclinical study on mice revealed that both vehicles containing mixed polymers enhanced and prolonged the antipruritic/analgesic-like effect of ophthalmic ketotifen. Based on these results, both combinations of polysaccharide polymers, especially SH-HPG, could be considered as potential new carriers for ketotifen for ophthalmic use. "

"Abstract: Cosmeceuticals are topically applied cosmetic products containing a biologically active ingredient with a pharmaceutical effect that improves, nourishes, and treats the skin appearance. The trend of cosmeceuticals began during the mid-20th century due to its potent ingredients with therapeutic effects for various skin ailments. Even though there is a great advancement in cosmetics, which shows the risk of cosmetic linked melanoma, endocrine disorders, and birth defects which was one in 1500 people during 1935 have increased to one in 75 people in 2000. Hence, as a part of reducing the harmful effect, natural ingredients were added to the formulation to give the pharmaceutical effect. Thus, natural/herbal cosmeceuticals were introduced. Due to the awareness of the side effects such as photo-toxicity, mutagenicity, irritation by these synthetic products, people started preferring herbal/natural cosmetic products. Moreover, natural cosmeceuticals were proven to be effective against various dermatological conditions as well as have fewer side effects marked the natural/herbal cosmeceuticals in the market. Unlike a drug, cosmeceutical products undergo safety, toxicity, and efficacy tests, but these are not classified under Food and Drug Administration. This review will give an insight into different natural ingredients used in natural/herbal cosmeceutical formulation and their function challenges faced during formulation, advantages of natural cosmeceuticals over regular cosmeceuticals, and regulatory aspects in India.

"Abstract: Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is second only to COVID-19 as the top infectious disease killer worldwide. Multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) may arise because of poor patient adherence to medications due to lengthy treatment duration and side effects. Delivering novel host directed therapies (HDT), like all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) may help to improve drug regimens and reduce the incidence of MDR-TB. Local delivery of ATRA to the site of infection leads to higher bioavailability and reduced systemic side effects. ATRA is poorly soluble in water and has a short half-life in plasma. Therefore, it requires a formulation step before it can be administered in vivo. ATRA loaded PLGA nanoparticles suitable for nebulization were manufactured and optimized using a scalable nanomanufacturing microfluidics (MF) mixing approach (MF-ATRA-PLGA NPs). MF-ATRA-PLGA NPs demonstrated a dose dependent inhibition of Mtb growth in TB-infected A549 alveolar epithelial cell model while preserving cell viability. The MF-ATRA-PLGA NPs were nebulized with the Aerogen Solo vibrating mesh nebulizer, with aerosol droplet size characterized using laser diffraction and the estimated delivered dose was determined. The volume median diameter (VMD) of the MF-ATRA-PLGA NPs was 3.00 ± 0.18 μm. The inhaled dose delivered in adult and paediatric 3D printed head models under a simulated normal adult and paediatric breathing pattern was found to be 47.05 ± 3 % and 20.15 ± 3.46 % respectively. These aerosol characteristics of MF-ATRA-PLGA NPs supports its suitability for delivery to the lungs via inhalation. The data generated on the efficacy of an inhalable, scalable and regulatory friendly ATRA-PLGA NPs formulation provides a foundation on which further pre-clinical testing can be built. Overall, the results of this project are promising for future research into ATRA loaded NPs formulations as inhaled host directed therapies for TB. "
"Abstract: Topical ROCEN (Roc), liposomal arthrocen hydrogel, is a robust anti-inflammatory formulation which has been developed for skin diseases such as eczema. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Roc 2% on the healing of imiquimod (Imiq)-induced psoriasis in a mouse model. Psoriasis was induced by applying Imiq topically to the mice's back skin once daily for five consecutive days. Moreover, a group of animal experiments was treated with Cyclosporine A (CsA), as a standard drug, for comparison with Roc treated group. The efficacy of Roc on skin lesions was evaluated by employing Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores. Subsequently, the skin samples were assessed using Baker's scoring system and Masson's trichrome staining, immunohistochemistry, and real-time PCR analysis. The observational and histopathological results indicated that topical application of Roc significantly reduced the PASI and Baker's scores in the plaque-type psoriasis model. Moreover, biochemical assessments showed that Roc suppressed significantly the increase of IL-17, IL-23, and TNF-α cytokines gene expression in the lesion site of psoriatic animals. In conclusion topical Roc 2% could significantly alleviate major pathological aspects of Imiq-induced psoriasis through inflammation inhibition which was comparable to the CsA drug. The beneficial outcomes of Roc application in the psoriasis model suggest its potential usage in complementary medicine. "
"BACKGROUND: Dopamine (D) and serotonin (5-HT) pathways contribute to psoriasis pathobiology. Disruptions incite increased inflammatory mediators, keratinocyte activation and deterioration, and worsening symptoms. Brilaroxazine (RP5063), which displays potent high binding affinity to D METHODS: An imiquimod-induced psoriatic mouse model (BALB/c) evaluated brilaroxazine's activity in a topical liposomal-aqueous gel (Lipogel) formulation. Two of the three groups (n = 6 per) underwent induction with 5% imiquimod, and one group received topical brilaroxazine Lipogel (Days 1-11). Assessments included (1) Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores (Days 1-12), skin histology for Baker score based on H&E stained tissue (Day 12), and serum blood collection for serum cytokine analysis (Day 12). One-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Dunnett's t-test evaluated significance (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Imiquimod-induced animal Baker scores were higher versus Sham non-induced control's results (p < 0.001). Brilaroxazine Lipogel had significantly (p = 0.003) lower Baker scores versus the induced Psoriasis group. Brilaroxazine PASI scores were lower (p = 0.03) versus the induced Psoriasis group (Days 3-12), with the greatest effect in the last 3 days. The induced Psoriasis group showed higher Ki-67 and TGF-β levels versus non-induced Sham controls (p = 0.001). The brilaroxazine Lipogel group displayed lower levels of these cytokines versus the induced Psoriasis group, Ki-67 (p = 0.001) and TGF-β (p = 0.008), and no difference in TNF-α levels versus Sham non-induced controls. CONCLUSION: Brilaroxazine Lipogel displayed significant activity in imiquimod-induced psoriatic animals, offering a novel therapeutic strategy. "

"INTRODUCTION: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has gained significant attention due to its superiority over conventional treatments. In the context of skin cancers and nonmalignant skin diseases, topical application of photosensitizer formulations onto affected skin, followed by illumination, offers distinct advantages. Topical PDT simplifies therapy by providing easy access to the skin, increasing drug concentration within the target area, and confining residual photosensitivity to the treated skin. However, the effectiveness of topical PDT is often hindered by challenges such as limited skin penetration or photosensitizer instability. Additionally, the hypoxic tumor environment poses further limitations. Nanocarriers present a promising solution to address these challenges. AREAS COVERED: The objective of this review is to comprehensively explore and highlight the role of various nanocarriers in advancing topical PDT for the treatment of skin diseases. The primary focus is to address the challenges associated with conventional topical PDT approaches and demonstrate how nanotechnology-based strategies can overcome these challenges, thereby improving the overall efficiency and efficacy of PDT. EXPERT OPINION: Nanotechnology has revolutionized the field of PDT, offering innovative tools to combat the unfavorable features of photosensitizers and hurdles in PDT. Nanocarriers enhance skin penetration and stability of photosensitizers, provide controlled drug release, reduce needed dose, increase production of reactive oxygen species, while reducing side effects, thereby improving PDT effectiveness.

"Abstract: Cutaneous fungal infections affect millions around the world. However, severe, multi-resistant fungal infections are increasingly being reported over the past years. As a result of the high rate of resistance which urged for drug repurposing, statins were studied and found to have multiple pleiotropic effects, especially when combined with other already-existing drugs. An example of this is the synergism found between several typical antifungals and statins, such as antifungals Imidazole and Triazole with a wide range of statins shown in this review. The main mechanisms in which they exert an antifungal effect are ergosterol inhibition, protein prenylation, mitochondrial disruption, and morphogenesis/mating inhibition. This article discusses multiple in vitro studies that have proven the antifungal effect of systemic statins against many fungal species, whether used alone or in combination with other typical antifungals. However, as a result of the high rate of drug-drug interactions and the well-known side effects of systemic statins, topical statins have become of increasing interest. Furthermore, patients with dyslipidemia treated with systemic statins who have a new topical fungal infection could benefit from the antifungal effect of their statin. However, it is still not indicated to initiate systemic statins in patients with topical mycotic infections if they do not have another indication for statin use, which raises the interest in using topical statins for fungal infections. This article also tackles the different formulations that have been studied to enhance topical statins' efficacy, as well as the effect of different topical statins on distinct dermatologic fungal diseases.

"Abstract: Sunlight, despite its benefits, can pose a threat to the skin, which is a natural protective barrier. Phototoxicity caused by overexposure, especially to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), results in burns, accelerates photoaging, and causes skin cancer formation. Natural substances of plant origin, i.e., polyphenols, flavonoids, and photosynthetic pigments, can protect the skin against the effects of radiation, acting not only as photoprotectors like natural filters but as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory remedies, alleviating the effects of photodamage to the skin. Plant-based formulations are gaining popularity as an attractive alternative to synthetic filters. Over the past 20 years, a large number of studies have been published to assess the photoprotective effects of natural plant products, primarily through their antioxidant, antimutagenic, and anti-immunosuppressive activities. This review selects the most important data on skin photodamage and photoprotective efficacy of selected plant carotenoid representatives from in vivo studies on animal models and humans, as well as in vitro experiments performed on fibroblast and keratinocyte cell lines. Recent research on carotenoids associated with lipid nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, liposomes, and micelles is reviewed. The focus was on collecting those nanomaterials that serve to improve the bioavailability and stability of carotenoids as natural antioxidants with photoprotective activity. "

"BACKGROUND: Tofacitinib is an oral JAK inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The clinical efficacy and safety of an administered tofacitinib, either monotherapy or in combination with conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, mainly methotrexate (MTX), have been evaluated. The high plasma concentration with delayed medicine clearance may affect the liver and/or kidney functions. In this study, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC- MS/MS) method for the quantitative analysis of methotrexate, tofacitinib, and metabolite M9 in plasma of Sprague Dawley (SD) rats was developed, and its effectiveness was validated as well. METHODS: Methotrexate, tofacitinib, M9 and fedratinib (internal standard, IS) were separated by gradient elution. The chromatography was performed on an Acquity BEH C18 (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 1.7 μm) column with the mobile phases of acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution with different proportions at the flow rate of 0.30 mL/min. In the positive ionization mode, the analyzes were detected using a Xevo TQ-S triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer, with the following mass transition pairs:  RESULTS: The obtained results manifested good calibration linearity over the ranges of tofacitinib at 0.1-100 ng/mL, M9 at 0.05-100 ng/mL, and methotrexate at 0.05-100 ng/mL. The lower limit of quantifications (LLOQs) of methotrexate, tofacitinib and M9 were 0.05 ng/mL, 0.1 ng/mL and 0.05 ng/mL, respectively. Intra-day and inter-day accuracy values were confirmed with a range of -6.3% to 12.7%, while intra-day and inter-- day precision values were ≤14.4%. Additionally, recoveries were greater than 86.5% for each compound without significant matrix effects. CONCLUSION: The currently established analytical method exhibited great potential for the evaluation of plasma concentrations of methotrexate, tofacitinib and M9 simultaneously, greatly reducing the detection time, which would serve as a supplementary role in formulating dose decisions to achieve personalized treatment, identify drugs that cause adverse reactions and finally, to assess drug-drug interactions on clinical studies.

"BACKGROUND: Corticosteroid-containing medications are widely accessible in various forms, including topical, injectable, and inhaled formulations. Due to uncertain safety profiles, healthcare providers, including pharmacists, often express apprehension when dispensing these drugs. This cross-sectional study assesses the knowledge, attitudes, and phobia of Jordanian pharmacists regarding corticosteroid-containing medications. METHODS: Conducted through a self-administered online questionnaire. RESULTS: the study reveals that dermatological conditions and respiratory disorders are the primary indications for prescribing corticosteroid-containing drugs. The most reported side effects among pharmacists' patients include increased appetite, diabetes, and skin thinning. Pharmacists generally exhibit acceptable knowledge, with a median score of 9.0 out of 11.0 (IQR = 3.0). Over two-thirds of pharmacists (69.9%) achieve a high knowledge score (Bloom's cut-off point ≥ 8.8). However, only 55.7% are aware that corticosteroids may induce mood changes. High phobia scores, particularly concerning increased blood pressure and osteoporosis risks, indicate pharmacist reservations in corticosteroid dispensing. Interestingly, pharmacists in rural areas display lower knowledge scores, while those working outside community pharmacies exhibit lower phobia scores compared to their counterparts in urban areas and community pharmacies, respectively. CONCLUSION: Despite generally good knowledge levels, the study underscores high phobia scores among Jordanian pharmacists regarding corticosteroid dispensing, particularly due to concerns about blood pressure elevation and osteoporosis risks. This suggests a potential need for targeted educational interventions and support systems to enhance pharmacist confidence and optimize corticosteroid usage while minimizing associated risks. "

"Abstract: One of the major threats to skin aging and the risk of developing skin cancer is excessive exposure to the sun's ultraviolet radiation (UVR). The use of sunscreens containing different synthetic, organic, and inorganic UVR filters is one of the most widespread defensive measures. However, increasing evidence suggests that some of these compounds are potentially eco-toxic, causing subtle damage to the environment and to marine ecosystems. Resorting to natural products produced in a wide range of marine species to counteract UVR-mediated damage could be an alternative strategy. The present work investigates marine-inspired thiol compounds, derivatives of ovothiol A, isolated from marine invertebrates and known to exhibit unique antioxidant properties. However, their potential use as photoprotective molecules for biocompatible sunscreens and anti-photo aging formulations has not yet been investigated. Here, we report on the UVR absorption properties, photostability, and in vitro UVA shielding activities of two synthetic ovothiol derivatives, 5-thiohistidine and iso-ovothiol A, by spectrophotometric and fluorimetric analysis. We found that the UVA properties of these compounds increase upon exposure to UVA and that their absorption activity is able to screen UVA rays, thus reducing the oxidative damage induced to proteins and lipids. The results of this work demonstrate that these novel marine-inspired compounds could represent an alternative eco-friendly approach for UVR skin protection. "
"Abstract: Bleomycin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) are widely used in various dermatological disorders. Both drugs are well-recognized as antineoplastic drugs and exert their effect by blocking the cell cycle. Topical and intralesional formulations are available and have been studied in both non-neoplastic and cancerous lesions. However, data comparing the effect of bleomycin and 5-FU in the dermatological disorders are limited. This review outlines the action mechanisms of both drugs and compares their clinical efficacies in a wide range of dermatologic diseases including hypertrophic scar, wart, skin cancer, vascular malformation, hemangioma, and vitiligo, and discusses the overall safety of the drugs. Intralesional bleomycin treatment is effective in hypertrophic scars and warts, but intralesional 5-FU may also be considered since it is cheaper and less painful. Moreover, intralesional 5-FU and bleomycin injection is a viable option for premalignant lesions (i.e., actinic keratosis) and inoperable skin cancers. Both bleomycin and 5-FU have been applied as treatment adjuncts for vitiligo, with 5-FU showing a slightly better outcome. Both agents have a good safety profile, and no serious side effects have been reported following their use in the field of dermatology. "
"BACKGROUND: Topical chlormethine (CL) is recommended as a first-line treatment for early-stage mycosis fungoides (MF) and in 2017, the European Medicines Agency approved the CL gel formulation to treat adult patients. More recently, to increase patient compliance and adherence, clinicians have developed flexible protocols that allow the concomitant use of CL gel with topical corticosteroids in daily practice regimens. Therefore, sharing real-life data on CL gel use and side effects management may help improve the use of this agent. OBJECTIVES: To expand knowledge about the actual use of CL gel in patients with MF, the present study assessed the improvement of MF skin lesions after CL gel treatment and provided information on the management of cutaneous adverse events (AEs) in a real-life setting. METHODS: This was an Italian retrospective study conducted among six dermatology referral centers. Patients ≥18 years affected by MF and in treatment with CL gel (160 µ/g), alone or in combination according to routine clinical practice, between December 2019 and December 2021 were considered. The study's primary aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of CL gel in terms of overall response rate (ORR) after 3 months of treatment. RESULTS: A total of 79 patients (61% male) with different stages of MF (84% early stage) were included. CL gel was prescribed mainly in association with topical corticosteroids (66% of patients). ORR after 3 months of treatment was 42%, with no differences between early- and advanced-stage MF. Response rates improved over time up to 97% after 18 months of treatment. Overall, 66 AEs were reported in 67% of patients; most were hyperpigmentation (45%) and irritant contact dermatitis (37%). Six AEs led to treatment discontinuation, and five out of six (83%) patients who reported these events resumed treatment after interruption. No AEs were classified as severe. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations support the use of CL gel in patients with early- and advanced-stage MF, making it a valuable treatment option. "
"PURPOSE: This study evaluates the use, benefit-risk profile, and economic impact of generic immunosuppressants (tacrolimus-TAC, cyclosporine-CsA, and mycophenolate-MYC) in kidney and liver transplant recipients compared to brand-name drugs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective multicentre observational study, involving four Italian regions, was conducted based on the national transplant Information system and regional healthcare claims data. The analysis focused on incident patients who received kidney and liver transplants between 2013 and 2019 and evaluated the use of generic of CsA, TAC, and MYC during the 30-day period following discharge. For each type of transplant and immunosuppressive agent, the benefit-risk profile of generic vs branded drugs in a two-year window was estimated by multivariate Cox models (HR; 95% CI). Furthermore, the potential cost savings per person associated with one year of treatment using generics were calculated. RESULTS: The utilization of generic drugs showed a significant increase; over the study years, the proportion of users among kidney recipients ranged from 14.2% to 40.5% for TAC, from 36.9% to 56.7% for MYC, and from 18.2% to 94.7% for CsA. A great variability in generic uptake for region was found. A comparable risk-benefit profile between generic and branded formulations was shown for all immunosuppressors considered. Choosing generic immunosuppressants during maintenance could result in yearly savings of around 2000 euros per person for each therapy ingredient. CONCLUSION: The study shows an increasing proportion of patients using generic immunosuppressive drugs over time suggesting a growing acceptance of generics within the transplant community and reveals comparable risk-benefit profiles between the generic and branded formulations of TAC, CsA, and MYC. A significant variability in the use of generics immunosuppressive agents was found both at the regional level and among transplant centers and future research should delve into regional prescribing variations.

"BACKGROUND: Microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) have become a growing concern in dermatology due to their widespread presence in cosmetic formulations and the environment. These minuscule synthetic polymer particles prompt an essential exploration of their potential impact on dermatological homeostasis. AIMS: This study aims to investigate the effects of MPs and NPs on the integumentary system. Specifically, it seeks to understand the potential cutaneous alterations, inflammatory responses, and disruptions to the skin's physiological functions caused by these synthetic particles. PATIENTS/METHODS: The investigation involves a comprehensive analysis of emerging research on MPs and NPs. This includes their presence in cosmetic formulations and environmental pervasiveness. The study delves into their capacity to breach the cutaneous barrier, raising concerns about the implications of prolonged exposure. RESULTS: Evidence suggests that MPs and NPs may indeed incite cutaneous alterations, provoke inflammatory responses, and disturb the homeostasis of the skin's physiological functions. Their small dimensions enhance their capability to breach the cutaneous barrier, further emphasizing the apprehensions associated with prolonged exposure. CONCLUSIONS: While a precise understanding of the implications of MPs and NPs on dermatological health remains an ongoing scientific endeavor, this study underscores the growing significance of these synthetic particles. The findings emphasize the need for proactive measures to safeguard both individual well-being and environmental preservation in the context of dermatological health. "
"INTRODUCTION: The biosimilar CT-P13, the first and only subcutaneous (SC) infliximab formulation, is recommended for patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and can be administered as a maintenance treatment, to be started 4 weeks after the induction treatment with 2 intravenous (IV) infliximab infusions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate treatment with SC infliximab without prior IV infusion induction to meet patient needs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After approval by the ethics review board and based on the schedule approved for rheumatoid arthritis, SC induction was performed with infliximab CT-P13 120 mg weekly for 4 weeks, followed by an injection of 120 mg every 2 weeks. RESULTS: After 4 months of therapy, joint symptoms were resolved, inflammation parameters were normalized (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) reduced from 42 to 16 mm/h, and C-reactive protein from 1.74 to 0.43 mg/dL), and clinical assessment parameters were improved. After 9 months of therapy, the clinical data remained stable, with no adverse events or local side effects. CONCLUSION: SC infliximab was successfully used without previous IV infusion induction. Although, to date, the induction of PsA treatment via the SC route is not foreseen, the known pharmacokinetic properties and the outcome improvements observed in our patient show that subcutaneous treatment induction, as is already done in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, is also possible.

"Abstract: UV filters (organic or mineral) present in sunscreen products are emerging contaminants of coastal aquatic environments. There is an urgent need to understand marine organisms responses to these compounds. In this study, we investigated the effect of exposure to dilutions of commercial sunscreen formulations on bacterial communities of mullet (Chelon sp.). The gut and skin mucus microbial communities were characterized using a metabarcoding approach targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Our results revealed that mullets had its own bacterial communities that differ from their surrounding habitats and specific to tissue. The dilutions of commercial sunscreens modified the relative abundance of Actinobacteroita, Bacteriodota and Proteobacteria for both gut and skin microbiota. They also allowed to bacteria affiliated to Mycobacterium, Nocardia and Tenacibaculum genera, known to house pathogenic species, to colonize the epithelium which may have implications for fish host health.

"Abstract: Cyclosporine (CsA) is a potent immunosuppressant agent that has been used since 1980 for the treatment of various autoimmune diseases and is extensively used to enhance the survival rate of patients and grafts following organ transplant surgeries. CsA is a poorly soluble drug with a narrow therapeutic window and inter-subject variability, which can lead to graft rejection, nephrotoxicity and other severe adverse effects. This study explores a novel method that combines solubility enhancement of CsA using SNEDDS formulation and personalized dosage delivery using 3D printing technology. The oil phase was chosen as a combination of caproyl 90 and octanoic acid while the Smix phase was chosen as a combination of cremophore El and PEG 400. The optimized liquid SNEDDS was solidified using PEG 6000. An FDM printer was used to print a capsular shell with an oval base that ascends to form a dome with an opening at the top. This opening is used to fill the molten CsA-loaded SNEDDS formulation using a pipette or syringe. The CsA-loaded SNEDDS formulation was characterized by FTIR, DSC and SEM/EDX. The in-vitro release of CsA showed complete release within sixty minutes and followed Korsmeyer-Peppas release kinetics. The drug release was not affected by either the shell opening size or the amount of the loaded formulation. This novel method is simple and straightforward for personalized dosage delivery of drug-loaded SNEDDS formulations. "
"Abstract: Disorders of hyperpigmentation, such as melasma and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, disproportionately affect skin of color and have a profound impact on quality of life. Exposure to ultraviolet light (UVL) is a well-documented factor in these disorders. However, recent studies show that visible light (VL) is a significant and underrecognized contributor to hyperpigmentation, especially in skin of color. Our objective is to review the role of VL in disorders of hyperpigmentation and that of tinted sunscreens in protecting against VL. Tinted sunscreens containing iron oxides should be recommended over nontinted sunscreens for patients prone to disorders of hyperpigmentation, as iron oxides protect against VL in addition to UVL. Tinted sunscreens are more effective than nontinted sunscreens in preventing melasma relapses and reducing hyperpigmentation, and they may also enhance the depigmenting efficacy of topical hydroquinone. In the search for an ideal tinted sunscreen for a particular patient, several factors must be considered, including a broad spectrum with adequate coverage of both UVL and VL, tint, formulation texture, active ingredients, and cost. VL is increasingly recognized as a major contributor of hyperpigmentation, and adequate treatment for disorders of hyperpigmentation should include protection against VL. Tinted sunscreens are ideal but require consideration of cosmesis, efficacy, and affordability. "
"BACKGROUND: Long wavelength ultraviolet-A1 in combination with visible light induces hyperpigmentation, particularly in dark-skin phototypes. This study evaluated the efficacy of four sunscreen formulations in protecting against VL + UVA1 (370-700 nm). METHODS: The test products (A-D) were applied to the back of 12 volunteers, then irradiated with 320 J/cm RESULTS: Product D, containing titanium dioxide 11%, iron oxides 1%, and antioxidants, provided the highest and most consistent protection. Compared with unprotected irradiated control, it had statistically significantly less erythema on IGA, DRS (Δoxyhemoglobin), and colorimetry (Δa*) at Day 0; less pigmentation on IGA at all time points, on DRS (relative dyschromia) at Days 7 and 14, and on colorimetry (ΔITA) at Day 0. Product B, containing zinc oxide 12% plus organic UV filters, iron oxides 4%, and antioxidants, also showed some efficacy. CONCLUSION: Of the sunscreens tested, the tinted products provided better protection against VL + UVA1 than the non-tinted products. Since the product with 1% iron oxides was superior to the product with 4% iron oxides, further studies are needed to evaluate whether iron oxide content correlates with better protection. "
"Abstract: The goal of the current study was to explore the potential benefits of Tretinoin (Tre) fatty acid vesicles (Tre-FAV) as a prospective antipsoriatic topical delivery system. This promising system can counteract the drug challenges in terms of its extremely low aqueous solubility, instability, skin irritation, and serious systemic adverse effects. Tre-loaded fatty acid vesicles were successfully developed and entirely characterised. The selected formulation was investigated for in vitro release, ex vivo skin retention and psoriasis efficacy studies. The characterisation results of Tre-FAV showed it has a globular shape with a particle size of 126.37 ± 1.290 nm (0.188 ± 0.019 PDI). The entrapment efficiency and zeta potential were discovered to be 84.26 ± 0.816% and -28.9 ± 1.92 mV, respectively. Encapsulation of the drug in the fatty acid vesicles was also strengthened by differential scanning calorimetric and powder FTIR diffraction studies. In vitro release results showed that Tre-FAV significantly increased skin absorption and retention in comparison to the Tre solution. The topical application of Tre-FAV to a mouse model confirmed that it has superior in vivo antipsoriatic properties in terms of well-demarcated papules, erythema and reduced epidermal thickness in comparison to other treatments. The weight of the spleen and the levels of the cytokines IL-17 and IL-6 decreased after treatment. In conclusion, FAV dramatically increased the water solubility and skin permeability of Tre and its anti-psoriasis activity. "
"BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is a folic acid antagonist that is widely used to treat osteosarcoma, leukemia, breast cancer, and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The most important concerns with MTX are its poor solubility and high toxicity, particularly in liver cells. To enhance its solubility and to minimize its toxicity, we encapsulated MTX in niosomes and investigated its hepatotoxicity mechanisms using genetic biomarkers. METHODS: Niosomes were successfully prepared using a modified thin film method, and the prepared monodisperse smallsized formulation was subsequently characterized. In vitro cytotoxicity studies were performed both in hepatocarcinoma (HEP3G) and healthy liver (AML12) cell lines. Specifically, immunofluorescence assay and evaluation of the expression levels of apoptotic, antioxidant, heat shock protein, and oxidative stress genes were performed. RESULTS: The formulation had a particle size of 117.1 ± 33 nm, a surface charge of -38.41 ± 0.7 mV, and an encapsulation efficiency of 59.7% ± 2.3%. The results showed that the niosomal formulation exhibited significantly higher cytotoxic effects in HEP3G than in AML12. The immunofluorescence and genetic analyses showed that the increased cytotoxicity of niosomes resulted mainly from oxidative stress and slight apoptosis. DISCUSSION: These results demonstrated that niosomal drug delivery systems could be a new potential formulation for minimizing MTX-related hepatotoxicity. "

"BACKGROUND: Hyaluronic acid (HA) is mainly used to treat xerosis. It also exerts wound-healing, moisturizing, and antiaging effects. Although HA is considered an effective and safe ingredient in cosmetics, there is a constant demand for a more money-saving and effective formulation. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel hydrogel-based moisturizer containing HA cross-linked with silicone polymers, produced solely through irradiation without the use of cross-linking agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A safety study enrolled 30 participants with healthy skin to perform patch and photopatch tests while recording adverse events. For the efficacy study, 30 participants with xerosis were compared before and after using the novel hydrogel, evaluating the cutaneous barrier function, xerosis severity scale (XSS) score, participant's satisfaction, and Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA). Furthermore, the efficacy of the novel hydrogel-based moisturizer was evaluated by comparing it with a conventional moisturizer, Physiogel, in another 30 participants with xerosis. RESULTS: In the safety study, no serious adverse events were observed. In the efficacy study before and after use, skin hydration and skin surface lipid increased (p < 0.05) whereas the XSS scores decreased (p < 0.05) with time. In the comparative efficacy study with Physiogel, skin hydration increased whereas the XSS scores decreased (p < 0.05) over time in both groups. Furthermore, IGA improved in 100% of participants in both groups. Also, 100% and 93% of participants were satisfied with the novel hydrogel-based moisturizer and Physiogel, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The novel hydrogel-based moisturizer proved to be safe and effective for xerosis, showing comparable results to the conventional moisturizer. "
"BACKGROUND: Zinc oxide eugenol (ZOE) cement is a popular dental material due mainly to its analgesic, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. The formulation of ZOE cement from nano particle-sized zinc oxide (ZnO) has the potential to increase these properties as well as reduce its adverse effects to the surrounding tissues. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the subcutaneous tissue response towards nano ZOE cements (ZOE-A and ZOE-B) in comparison to conventional ZOE (ZOE-K). METHODS: Test materials were implanted into 15 New Zealand white rabbits. Tissue samples were obtained after 7, 14, and 30 days (n = 5 per period) for histopathological evaluation of inflammatory cell infiltrate, fibrous tissue condensation, and abscess formation. RESULTS: ZOE-A showed the lowest score for the variable macrophage and lymphocyte at day 7. Both ZOE-A and ZOE-B presented lower fibrous tissue condensation and abscess formation compared to conventional ZOE-K. By day 30, ZOE-A exhibited less lymphocytic and neutrophilic infiltrate compared to the other materials, while ZOE-B had the lowest score for macrophages. ZOE-K exerted higher inflammatory cell response at almost all of the experimental periods. All of the materials resulted in thin fiber condensation after 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: Rabbit tissue implanted with ZOE-A and ZOE-B showed better response compared to ZOE-K. "
"BACKGROUND: Alopecia is a dermatological condition affecting genders, negatively impacting their personality and quality of life (QoL). The current approved entities are limited, inconsistently effective, and associated with negative side effects. To alleviate this issue, ayurvedic herbs such as Ashwagandha have being explored. As a result, this study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ashwagandha (root extract) topical formulation (serum) on hair health in healthy adults. METHODS: In this prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, two arm, parallel, comparative study, the effects of topical Ashwagandha on the hair health was evaluated. Healthy adults between 18 and 45 years with mild to moderate hair loss were randomized to either Ashwagandha (topical) or Placebo (topical) treatment. The participants were assessed at Day-1 and Day-75 for change in efficacy parameters, which included 60 Seconds Hair Comb, Trichoscan analysis, Hair Pull test, Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) and QoL using Hair-specific Skindex-29. RESULTS: In the per protocol analysis of 61 participants, Ashwagandha group demonstrated significant reduction in hair shedding in the 60 Seconds Hair Comb test compared to Placebo at day 75. Similarly, Ashwagandha substantially enhanced hair density, growth, and thickness compared to the Placebo group (density = 7.3 vs. 2.8, P < 0.001; growth = 21.7 vs. 4.2, P < 0.001; thickness = 1.8 vs. 0.9, P < 0.001). In addition, Ashwagandha significantly improved QOL compared to placebo (Score = -17.3 vs. -6.1, P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: The study found that topical Ashwagandha (serum) improved hair growth and hair health indicators. Thus, it can be an effective and safer alternative for alopecia.

"Abstract: Organelle-targeted photosensitizers (PSs) for photodynamic therapy (PDT) are considered as an effective therapeutic strategy for the development of next generation PSs with the least side effects and high therapeutic efficacy. However, multiorganelle targeted PSs eliciting PDT via both type I and type II mechanisms are scarce. Herein, a series of cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes were formulated [Ir(C "
"Abstract: The growing concern regarding the adverse effects of synthetic UV filters found in sunscreens has spurred significant attention due to their potential harm to aquatic ecosystems and human health. To address this, the present study aimed to extract and microencapsulate sensitive bioactive compounds derived from by-product onion peel (OP) by molecular inclusion using β-cyclodextrin as the wall material. Identification and quantification of bioactive compounds within the extract were conducted through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-DAD) analysis, revealing quercetin and resveratrol as the primary constituents. The photoprotection capacity, evaluated by the sun protection factor (SPF), revealed a protection factor comparable to the value for a synthetic UV filter. The produced microparticles presented high antioxidant capacity, significant photoprotection capacity, encapsulation efficiency of 91.8%, mean diameter of 31 μm, and polydispersity of 2.09. Furthermore, to comprehensively evaluate the performance of OP extract and its potential as a natural UV filter, five O/W emulsions were produced. Results demonstrated that microparticles displayed superior ability in maintaining SPF values over a five-week period. Photoprotection evaluation-skin reactivity tests revealed that both extract and microparticles absorb UV radiation in other regions of UV radiation, revealing their potential to be used as a natural UV filter to produce a sustainable and eco-friendly value-added sunscreen.

"BACKGROUND: Orismilast is a novel oral phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) B/D inhibitor being investigated as a potential treatment for moderate-to-severe psoriasis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of orismilast modified-release formulation in moderate-to-severe psoriasis. METHODS: This multicenter, randomized (1:1:1:1 to 20, 30, 40 mg orismilast or placebo, twice daily), double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 2b, 16-week, dose-ranging study evaluated orismilast in adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (NCT05190419). Efficacy end points were analyzed using multiple imputation. RESULTS: Of 202 randomized patients, baseline characteristics were balanced across arms, except greater severe disease proportions for orismilast vs placebo. Orismilast showed significant improvements in the primary end point, percentage change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), from baseline to week 16 (orismilast -52.6% to -63.7% and placebo, -17.3%; all P <.001). Greater proportions receiving orismilast achieved PASI75 (39.5%-49.0%; P <.05) and PASI90 (22.0%-28.3%; P <.05 for 20 and 40 mg) vs placebo (PASI75, 16.5% and PASI90, 8.3%) at week 16. Safety findings were as expected with PDE4 inhibition; dose-dependent tolerability effects observed. LIMITATIONS: Small sample size, disease severity imbalance between groups, limited duration and diversity in study population. CONCLUSION: Orismilast demonstrated greater efficacy vs placebo and a safety profile in line with PDE4 inhibition. "
"BACKGROUND: Dyschromia is one of the most common reasons for patients to seek dermatological care, especially among individuals with skin of color. Most cases present as melasma or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH); both are chronic issues requiring long-term treatment. While many pharmaceutical (topical or systemic) or procedural (lasers/chemical peels) options are available, some treatments are not safe/tolerable for long-term use or can induce/exacerbate PIH.&nbsp; Methods: This qualitative review provides an overview of topical treatments for melasma and PIH, including recent data from an investigator-initiated trial of the retinoid tazarotene.&nbsp; Results: Topical hydroquinone (HQ) in the form of triple combination HQ 4%/tretinoin 0.05%/fluocinolone acetonide 0.01% cream is the gold-standard treatment for melasma and PIH but should not be used long-term due to safety concerns. Efficacy data for OTC/cosmeceutical products are limited or lacking. Topical retinoids are efficacious and safe, though dose and formulation differences may affect tolerability. Tazarotene 0.045% polymeric emulsion lotion demonstrated good efficacy, safety, and tolerability over 24 weeks in adult female patients with moderate-to-severe melasma and/or PIH. CONCLUSIONS: There are multiple topical treatments available for dyspigmentation. However, many are lacking efficacy data and others are limited by tolerability or safety concerns. Retinoids, such as tazarotene, may be an efficacious and safe treatment for melasma or PIH. J Drugs Dermatol. 2023;22(11):1118-1123&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; doi:10.36849/JDD.7754. "
"Abstract: Photosensitization with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) combined with photodynamic therapy (PDT) is approved in the United States for the treatment of actinic keratosis (AK) and is used off-label for other indications including acne treatment and photo rejuvenation. However, pain, particularly during the initial illumination period, limits the utility of this highly efficacious therapy. Although modifications to conventional ALA-PDT protocols that improve tolerability without diminishing efficacy have been identified, few have been evaluated in randomized, controlled trials, and the number of variables involved in ALA incubation (eg, duration, occlusion, ALA formulation, and strength) and PDT illumination (eg, light source, fluence rate, irradiance, and duration) confounds standardization.&nbsp; Perhaps the most promising modifications to date involve continuous activation of low levels of protoporphyrin IX, the photoactive metabolite of ALA, as well as using shorter incubation times (with or without prolongation of illumination), lower irradiance, and daylight or combined (daylight and conventional) PDT. However, reimbursement of PDT with alternative light sources in the US is hampered by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling, which specifies the blue or red light devices approved for use with corresponding marketed ALA 20% solution and 10% gel, respectively. This review summarizes the existing evidence with respect to pain control in patients undergoing ALA-PDT, recommendations from clinical experience, and goals for future research.&nbsp;J Drugs Dermatol. 2023;22(11):1082-1087 &nbsp; doi:10.36849/JDD.7637.

"Abstract: Prolonged skin exposure to UV radiation may result in sunburn, with possible inflammatory and oxidative stress to the skin, skin photoaging, photocarcinogenesis, even DNA damage, and apoptosis if sunscreen protection is not used. Due to the advantages that they offer, high encapsulation capability, increased stability of encapsulated bioactive agents, and release control, nanoparticulate materials have been used in sunscreens despite the hazard that they present: their capacity to penetrate the skin causing toxic side effects (especially the chemical sunscreens). The present study reports the preparation of nanoparticulate composites containing only GRAS substances and using an eco-friendly, inexpensive procedure. The ingredients used have properties that are beneficial to the skin. Zein (Z), a prolamin-rich protein from corn, is biodegradable and biocompatible, is a moisture attractor, and shows effective absorption by cells. Lupulone (L), extracted from hops, is an antibacterial and antioxidant agent that has a stimulating effect on the collagen production in the body due to its content of phytohormones. Gum arabic (GA) is a natural glycoprotein used in beverages and cosmetics as an emulsifier/stabilizer. Composite matrices containing Z/GA/L were prepared using a simple method (antisolvent), which replaces the flammable solvent ethanol with aqueous propylene glycol. The nanocomposites were characterized by FTIR, composition, encapsulation efficiency, and loading capacity for L, size, zeta potential, and morphology (SEM). Their biological activity was investigated as well. The zein-based nanoparticles showed antioxidant and antimicrobial effects (even some synergistic, unexpected behavior) and modulatory activity on the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-1. Due to their properties, the nanoparticles discussed herein show potential for use in formulations for the skin, especially for mature skin, replacing chemical substances with potential side effects used typically in topical delivery systems.

"OBJECTIVE: Catheter-related sepsis (CRS) is a major complication with significant morbidity and mortality. Evidence is lacking regarding the most appropriate antiseptic for skin disinfection before percutaneous central venous catheter (PCVC) insertion in preterm neonates. To inform the feasibility and design of a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) of two antiseptic formulations, we conducted the Antiseptic Randomised Controlled Trial for Insertion of Catheters (ARCTIC) feasibility study to assess catheter colonisation, sepsis, and skin morbidity. DESIGN: Feasibility RCT. SETTING: Two UK tertiary-level neonatal intensive care units. PATIENTS: Preterm infants born <34 weeks' gestation scheduled to undergo PCVC insertion. INTERVENTIONS: Skin disinfection with either 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG)-aqueous or 2% CHG-70% isopropyl alcohol (IPA) before PCVC insertion and at removal. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Proportion in the 2% CHG-70% IPA arm with a colonised catheter at removal. MAIN FEASIBILITY OUTCOMES: Rates of: (1) CRS, catheter-associated sepsis (CAS), and CRS/CAS per 1,000 PCVC days; (2) recruitment and retention; (3) data completeness. SAFETY OUTCOMES: Daily skin morbidity scores recorded from catheter insertion until 48 hours post-removal. RESULTS: 116 babies were randomised. Primary outcome incidence was 4.1% (95% confidence interval: 0.9% to 11.5%). Overall catheter colonisation rate was 5.2% (5/97); CRS 2.3/1000 catheter days; CAS 14.8/1000 catheter days. Recruitment, retention and data completeness were good. No major antiseptic-related skin injury was reported. CONCLUSIONS: A definitive comparative efficacy trial is feasible, but the very low catheter colonisation rate would make a large-scale RCT challenging due to the very large sample size required. ARCTIC provides preliminary reassurance supporting potential safe use of 2% CHG-70% IPA and 2% CHG-aqueous in preterm neonates. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN82571474. "
"Abstract: Hymenoptera venom (HV) is injected into the skin during a sting by Hymenoptera such as bees or wasps. Some components of HV are potential allergens and can cause large local and/or systemic allergic reactions (SAR) in sensitized individuals. During their lifetime, ~ 3% of the general population will develop SAR following a Hymenoptera sting. This guideline presents the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to SAR following Hymenoptera stings. Symptomatic therapy is usually required after a severe local reaction, but specific diagnosis or allergen immunotherapy (AIT) with HV (VIT) is not necessary. When taking a patient's medical history after SAR, clinicians should discuss possible risk factors for more frequent stings and more severe anaphylactic reactions. The most important risk factors for more severe SAR are mast cell disease and, especially in children, uncontrolled asthma. Therefore, if the SAR extends beyond the skin (according to the Ring and Messmer classification: grade > I), the baseline serum tryptase concentration shall be measured and the skin shall be examined for possible mastocytosis. The medical history should also include questions specific to asthma symptoms. To demonstrate sensitization to HV, allergists shall determine concentrations of specific IgE antibodies (sIgE) to bee and/or vespid venoms, their constituents and other venoms as appropriate. If the results are negative less than 2 weeks after the sting, the tests shall be repeated (at least 4 - 6 weeks after the sting). If only sIgE to the total venom extracts have been determined, if there is double sensitization, or if the results are implausible, allergists shall determine sIgE to the different venom components. Skin testing may be omitted if in-vitro methods have provided a definitive diagnosis. If neither laboratory diagnosis nor skin testing has led to conclusive results, additional cellular testing can be performed. Therapy for HV allergy includes prophylaxis of reexposure, patient self treatment measures (including use of rescue medication) in the event of re-stings, and VIT. Following a grade I SAR and in the absence of other risk factors for repeated sting exposure or more severe anaphylaxis, it is not necessary to prescribe an adrenaline auto-injector (AAI) or to administer VIT. Under certain conditions, VIT can be administered even in the presence of previous grade I anaphylaxis, e.g., if there are additional risk factors or if quality of life would be reduced without VIT. Physicians should be aware of the contraindications to VIT, although they can be overridden in justified individual cases after weighing benefits and risks. The use of β-blockers and ACE inhibitors is not a contraindication to VIT. Patients should be informed about possible interactions. For VIT, the venom extract shall be used that, according to the patient's history and the results of the allergy diagnostics, was the trigger of the disease. If, in the case of double sensitization and an unclear history regarding the trigger, it is not possible to determine the culprit venom even with additional diagnostic procedures, VIT shall be performed with both venom extracts. The standard maintenance dose of VIT is 100 µg HV. In adult patients with bee venom allergy and an increased risk of sting exposure or particularly severe anaphylaxis, a maintenance dose of 200 µg can be considered from the start of VIT. Administration of a non-sedating H1-blocking antihistamine can be considered to reduce side effects. The maintenance dose should be given at 4-weekly intervals during the first year and, following the manufacturer's instructions, every 5 - 6 weeks from the second year, depending on the preparation used; if a depot preparation is used, the interval can be extended to 8 weeks from the third year onwards. If significant recurrent systemic reactions occur during VIT, clinicians shall identify and as possible eliminate co-factors that promote these reactions. If this is not possible or if there are no such co-factors, if prophylactic administration of an H1-blocking antihistamine is not effective, and if a higher dose of VIT has not led to tolerability of VIT, physicians should should consider additional treatment with an anti IgE antibody such as omalizumab as off lable use. For practical reasons, only a small number of patients are able to undergo sting challenge tests to check the success of the therapy, which requires in-hospital monitoring and emergency standby. To perform such a provocation test, patients must have tolerated VIT at the planned maintenance dose. In the event of treatment failure while on treatment with an ACE inhibitor, physicians should consider discontinuing the ACE inhibitor. In the absence of tolerance induction, physicians shall increase the maintenance dose (200 µg to a maximum of 400 µg in adults, maximum of 200 µg HV in children). If increasing the maintenance dose does not provide adequate protection and there are risk factors for a severe anaphylactic reaction, physicians should consider a co-medication based on an anti-IgE antibody (omalizumab; off-label use) during the insect flight season. In patients without specific risk factors, VIT can be discontinued after 3 - 5 years if maintenance therapy has been tolerated without recurrent anaphylactic events. Prolonged or permanent VIT can be considered in patients with mastocytosis, a history of cardiovascular or respiratory arrest due to Hymenoptera sting (severity grade IV), or other specific constellations associated with an increased individual risk of recurrent and/or severe SAR (e.g., hereditary α-tryptasemia). In cases of strongly increased, unavoidable insect exposure, adults may receive VIT until the end of intense contact. The prescription of an AAI can be omitted in patients with a history of SAR grade I and II when the maintenance dose of VIT has been reached and tolerated, provided that there are no additional risk factors. The same holds true once the VIT has been terminated after the regular treatment period. Patients with a history of SAR grade ≥ III reaction, or grade II reaction combined with additional factors that increase the risk of non response or repeated severe sting reactions, should carry an emergency kit, including an AAI, during VIT and after regular termination of the VIT.

"Abstract: Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated disorder that commonly affects adults and children. In recent years, pediatric psoriasis has increased in prevalence and the disease is often associated with various comorbidities and psychological distress. The conventional topical treatments for psoriasis, such as corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, vitamin D analogs, anthralin, and coal tar, are often limited by their side effects, tolerability, and/or efficacy, particularly for use in children and on sensitive and intertriginous areas. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration approved two new topical non-steroidal agents for treating psoriasis that target different pathogenic pathways than the conventional treatments. Roflumilast is a phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor approved for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in patients aged 12 years and older. Tapinarof is a novel aryl hydrocarbon receptor modulator approved for adult psoriasis and currently undergoing studies for pediatric psoriasis. Ongoing efforts are also being made to optimize conventional treatments, for instance, a new foam formulation of halobetasol propionate was recently approved for pediatric psoriasis. Clinical trials of various new drugs targeting one or multiple pathogenic pathways of psoriasis, such as Janus kinase inhibitors, different formulations of phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitors, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor modulators have also been explored. The recent emergence of novel topical agents provides promising new options for managing pediatric psoriasis with the potential to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life. In this article, we review the mechanism of action, efficacy, and safety profile of novel topical agents and discuss their potential roles in the management of pediatric psoriasis. "
"INTRODUCTION: As of May 2023, 19 and 18 biosimilars have been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) respectively. AREA COVERED: Pharmacokinetic results of phase 1 studies of approved biosimilars were reviewed by systematic literature search. The impact of immunogenicity on the pharmacokinetic data and clinical response was assessed, and the potential benefit of monitoring serum concentrations of biologic drugs is discussed. The advantage of subcutaneous CT-P13 (an infliximab biosimilar) in clinical practice is reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: Biosimilars are approved based on the totality of evidence including comparable physiochemical properties, PK / PD profiles, and clinical efficacy and safety to the originator. To utilize biosimilars more effectively, physicians should be aware of the utility of combination DMARD therapy to reduce immunogenicity and maintain efficacy and PK profile. PK monitoring, however, is not currently recommended in clinical practice. CT-P13 subcutaneous (SC) is the first SC infliximab used for treatment of RA patients. Based on data from clinical studies and the real world, SC-infliximab is an attractive therapeutic option compared to IV formulations of infliximab based on its efficacy, pharmacokinetics, patient-reported outcomes, and safety profile.

"PURPOSE: Topical minoxidil (MNX) 2%-5% and oral finasteride (F) 1 mg/day are the only two pharmacological treatments authorized for androgenetic alopecia (AGA). Recently, a 2.2 mg/mL topical formulation of F was developed to minimize the systemic adverse effects associated with the oral formula. MNX and F act through different mechanisms; therefore, their association could improve clinical efficacy. To evaluate the efficacy of the association of 5% MNX and 0.25% topical F compared to their use in monotherapy, a 6-month, prospective, randomized, assessor-blinded trial was conducted. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-two males, mean age 24 ± 3 years, with AGA (I-VII of Norwood-Hamilton Grading Scale), treatment naive or free from any therapy for at least 6 months, were enrolled and randomly assigned to three arm treatment groups (2:1:1): group A (n = 19, the subjects applied 5% MNX in the morning and F spray in the evening), group B (n = 12, the subjects applied F spray in the evening), and group C (n = 11, the subjects applied 5% MNX twice daily). The efficacy of treatments was evaluated at baseline and after 3 and 6 months using a global photography score (GPAS; from -3 to +3) and trichoscopy evaluation and assessed by an investigator unaware of treatment allocation. At baseline and after treatments, the serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), and testosterone were also evaluated. RESULTS: All treatments resulted in an increase in hair density compared to baseline. However, this improvement was significant only for group A (MNX + F), both at three (+56 density/cm CONCLUSION: The association of 5% MNX lotion and 0.25% F in spray formulation in patients with AGA showed a significantly higher clinical and instrumental efficacy compared to the monotherapies, with comparable tolerability and safety profile.

"Abstract: Diet-induced obesity and hyperlipidemia are a growing public health concern leading to various metabolic disorders. Capsaicin, a major bioactive compound obtained from natural chili peppers, has demonstrated its numerous beneficial roles in treating obesity and weight loss. Current treatment involves either administration of antiobesity drugs or surgical procedures such as Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy, both of which are associated with serious side effects and poor patient acceptance. Capsaicin, a pungent molecule, has low oral bioavailability. Therefore, there is a need for the development of site-specific drug delivery system for capsaicin. The present study is aimed at preparing and characterizing 3D-printed capsaicin-loaded rod-shaped implants by thermoplastic extrusion-based 3D printing technology. The implants were printed with capsaicin-loaded into a biodegradable polymer, polycaprolactone, at different drug loadings and infill densities. The surface morphology revealed a smooth and uniform external surface without any capsaicin crystals. DSC thermograms showed no significant changes/exothermic events among the blends suggesting no drug polymer interactions. The in vitro release studies showed a biphasic release profile for capsaicin, and the release was sustained for more than three months (~ 85% released) irrespective of drug loading and infill densities. The HPLC method was stability-indicating and showed good resolution for its analogs, dihydrocapsaicin and nordihydrocapsaicin. The implants were stable for three months at accelerated conditions (40°C) without any significant decrease in the assay of capsaicin. Therefore, capsaicin-loaded implants can serve as a long-acting injectable formulation for targeting the adipose tissue region in obese patients. "
"Abstract: Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated cow's milk allergy (CMA) is a common food reaction resulting from the consumption of cow's milk protein (CMP). The clinical manifestations of CMA include mild to severe urticaria, skin-manifested hypersensitivity reactions, and anaphylaxis. Food allergies may affect 8% of children and 10% of adults. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) requires that the label of a food must declare the presence of a ""major food allergen"" (MFA) contained in the food or ingredient. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) generally regards milk protein concentrate (MPC) as safe for human consumption and use. The increasing use of MPC in formulations raises the need for its revelation in prescription and on labels of over-the-counter drugs. This review investigates oral and topical (including mucosal) preparations containing MPC for dermatologic and other uses and their therapeutic impact. Our findings suggest that for the adult population, the risk of serious cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) from medications is minimal. "
"Abstract: Sunscreen products constitute two distinct categories. Recreational sunscreens protect against high-intensity, episodic sun exposure, often applied over the entire body. In contrast, facial sunscreen products are designed for sub-erythemal, low-intensity daily sun exposure. Such different exposures necessitate distinctive product safety assessments. Building on earlier methods for predicting dermal disposition, a mechanistic model was developed to simulate plasma concentrations of seven organic sunscreen active ingredients: avobenzone, ensulizole, homosalate, octinoxate, octisalate, octocrylene, and oxybenzone, following facial application. In vitro permeation testing (IVPT) was performed with two different vehicles using a subset of the UV filters. These IVPT results, in addition to previously published IVPT data and published in vivo Maximal Usage Trial (MUsT) data for the UV filters, were used to train the mechanistic dermal model via a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. An external validation of the trained model with real-world in vivo datasets demonstrated that the model's predicted UV filter plasma concentrations align well with experimental measurements and capture the observed inter-individual variability. Predictions of steady-state UV filter plasma concentrations under facial application scenarios at 5% concentration and at the maximal allowable concentrations were then generated by the trained model. Oxybenzone had the greatest predicted plasma concentration following facial application. Homosalate and octisalate predictions had high uncertainty associated with the absence of data. Several application scenarios pertaining to avobenzone, ensulizole, octocrylene and octinoxate were identified in which median plasma concentration levels were at 0.5 ng/ml or below when applied in the recreational or facial product. Model limitations include uncertainty in vehicle/water partitioning, formulation metamorphosis, and UV filter systemic clearance, all of which can be refined with additional data. For UV filters, limiting exposure to facial application reduces human safety concerns based on FDA established thresholds. "
"Abstract: The use of nanotechnology strategies is a current hot topic, and research in this field has been growing significantly in the cosmetics industry. Inorganic nanoparticles stand out in this context for their distinctive physicochemical properties, leading in particular to an increased refractive index and absorption capacity giving them a broad potential for cutaneous applications and making them of special interest in research for dermopharmaceutical and cosmetic purposes. This performance is responsible for its heavy inclusion in the manufacture of skin health products such as sunscreens, lotions, beauty creams, skin ointments, makeup, and others. In particular, their suitable bandgap energy characteristics allow them to be used as photocatalytic semiconductors. They provide excellent UV absorption, commonly known as UV filters, and are responsible for their wide worldwide use in sunscreen formulations without the undesirable white residue after consumer application. In addition, cosmetics based on inorganic nanoparticles have several additional characteristics relevant to formulation development, such as being less expensive compared to other nanomaterials, having greater stability, and ensuring less irritation, itching, and propensity for skin allergies. This review will address in detail the main inorganic nanoparticles used in dermopharmaceutical and cosmetic products, such as titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, silicon dioxide, silver, gold, copper, and aluminum nanoparticles, nanocrystals, and quantum dots, reporting their physicochemical characteristics, but also their additional intrinsic properties that contribute to their use in this type of formulations. Safety issues regarding inorganic nanoparticles, based on toxicity studies, both to humans and the environment, as well as regulatory affairs associated with their use in dermopharmaceuticals and cosmetics, will be addressed.

"BACKGROUND: Furosemide is a mainstay of treatment in congestive heart failure (CHF) and is widely prescribed to dogs and cats by several formulations, including the subcutaneous one. In canine and human medicine, dermatologic adverse effects of subcutaneous furosemide (SF) have been documented; conversely, no prior case has been published describing skin reactions to this therapeutic protocol in cats. In this report, we describe, for the first time in feline medicine, a suspected dermatologic adverse effect after SF in a cat. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 2-year-old domestic shorthair cat was presented for CHF associated with lung edema and pleural effusion. Echocardiography revealed asymmetric left ventricular myocardial thickening and severe left atrial dilation. The cat was hospitalized and initially treated with oxygen, intravenous furosemide, and clopidogrel. After discharge, the route of administration of furosemide was switched from intravenous to oral. Within the following 2 weeks, the cat experienced two relapses of lung edema despite the progressive increase of the furosemide dose, the addition of spironolactone and adherence to the therapeutic protocol by the owners. The dose of furosemide was further increased and its route of administration at home was switched from oral to parental. As the owner was not able to administrate intramuscular injections, SF was prescribed. This allowed the prevention of further episodes of lung edema. However, although the cat had never presented skin problems before, multiple well-defined circular, crusted ulcerative cutaneous lesions associated with alopecia developed at the sites of furosemide injections 2 weeks later. After ruling out several differential diagnoses for these lesions, a rare side effect of furosemide, not yet described in cats but already known in canine and human medicine, was strongly suspected as the possible cause. Therefore, the ongoing injectable formulation of furosemide was interrupted and substituted with an alternative brand, maintaining the same dose and route of administration. Thanks to this change, the dermal ulcerations disappeared within 1 month. Subsequently, the cat experienced neither further skin problems nor a recurrence of lung edema. CONCLUSION: Although SF is sometimes prescribed in small animal practice, it should be noticed that this may lead to dermatologic adverse reactions in the cat. "
"Abstract: The phototoxicity of photosensitizers (PSs) pre and post photodynamic therapy (PDT), and the hypoxic tumor microenvironment are two major problems limiting the application of PDT. While activatable PSs can successfully address the PS phototoxicity pre PDT, and type I PS can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) effectively in hypoxic environment, very limited approaches are available for addressing the phototoxicity post PDT. There is virtually no solution available to address all these issues using a single design. Herein, we propose a proof-of-concept on-demand switchable photosensitizer with quenched photosensitization pre and post PDT, which could be activated only in tumor hypoxic environment. Particularly, a hypoxia-normoxia cycling responsive type I PS TPFN-AzoCF "
"Abstract: E-selectin, which is highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells near tumor and get involved in the all tumor growth steps: occurrence, proliferation and metastasis, is considered as a promise targeted protein for antitumor drug discovery. Herein, we would like to report the design, preparation and the anticancer evaluation of the peptide-PEG-podophyllotoxin conjugate(PEG-Pep-PODO), in which the short peptide (CIELLQAR) was used as the E-selectin ligand for the targeting purpose and the PEG portion the molecule got the conjugate self-assembled to form a water soluble nanoparticle. In vitro release study showed that the conjugated and entrapped PODO could be released simultaneously in the presence of GSH (highly expressed in tumor environmental conditions) and the GSH would catalyze the break of the disufur bond which linked of the PODO and the peptide-PEG portion of the conjugate. Cell adhesion test of the PEG-Pep-PODO indicated that E-selectin ligand peptide CIELLQAR could get specifically and efficiently binding to the E-selectin expressing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). In vitro cytotoxicity assay further revealed that PEG-Pep-PODO significantly improved the selectivity of PEG-Pep-PODO for killing the tumor cells and normal cells compared with PODO solution formulation. More importantly, the in vivo experiment demonstrated that the conjugate would accumulate of the PODO payload in tumor through targeting endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment, which resulted in the much improved in vivo inhibition of tumor growth, intratumoral microvessel density, and decreased systemic toxicity of this nanoparticle over the free PODO. Furthermore, this water soluble conjugate greatly improved the pharmacokinetic properties of the mother molecule. "
"BACKGROUND: Single-agent chemotherapy using methotrexate or actinomycin D is the first-line treatment for patients with low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Various methotrexate-based and actinomycin D-based single-agent regimens can be used. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine the superior regimen. To guide doctors in selecting a single-agent chemotherapy regimen for patients with low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, we will compare two regimens. METHODS: We will conduct a multicentre, randomized, prospective clinical trial. Selected low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia patients (FIGO score 0-4) will be randomized 1:1 to a biweekly single-dose actinomycin D group or a multiday methotrexate therapy group. The actinomycin D group will receive IV pulse actinomycin D (1.25 mg/m DISCUSSION: Previous clinical trials comparing biweekly single-dose actinomycin D with multiday methotrexate therapy for treating low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia patients failed to meet the expected case number. Through this multicentre study, the complete remission ratio and efficacy difference between biweekly single-dose actinomycin D and multiday methotrexate therapy will be obtained. This study will also provide the basis for formulating a preferred regimen for treating patients with low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04562558, Registered on 13 September 2020 (Protocol version 2020-9-24, version 1.0). "
"Abstract: Calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus are immunosuppressant drugs that are known to induce tremors. Non-calcineurin inhibitors such as sirolimus and everolimus have also reportedly been accompanied by tremors, albeit less likely. However, the prevalence rates reported in the literature are notably wide, and the risk profiles for these drug-induced tremors are less understood. We searched PubMed to extract data on the risk of tremors with these drugs when prescribed for various transplant and non-transplant indications. We ascertained whether the risk of drug-induced tremor is influenced by the underlying diagnosis, dosing formulations, drug concentrations, and blood monitoring. We extracted data on treatment strategies and outcomes for tremors. Articles were primarily screened based on English language publications, abstracts, and studies with n ≥ 5, which included case series, retrospective studies, case-controlled studies, and prospective studies. We found 81 eligible studies comprising 33 cyclosporine, 43 tacrolimus, 6 sirolimus, and 1 everolimus that discussed tremor as an adverse event. In the pooled analysis of studies with n > 100, the incidence of tremor was 17% with cyclosporine, 21.5% with tacrolimus, and 7.8% with sirolimus and everolimus together. Regarding the underlying diagnosis, tremor was more frequently reported in kidney transplant (cyclosporine 28%, tacrolimus 30.1%) and bone marrow transplant (cyclosporine 40%, tacrolimus 41.9%) patients compared with liver transplant (cyclosporine 9%, tacrolimus 11.5%) and nontransplant indications (cyclosporine 21.5%, tacrolimus 11.3%). Most studies did not report whether the risk of tremors correlated with drug concentrations in the blood. The prevalence of tremors when using the twice-daily formulation of tacrolimus was nearly the same as the once-daily formulation (17% vs 18%). Data on individual-level risk factors for tremors were lacking. Except for three studies that found some benefit to maintaining magnesium levels, there were minimal data on treatments and outcomes. A large body of data supports a substantive and wide prevalence of tremor resulting from tacrolimus use followed by cyclosporine, especially in patients receiving a kidney transplant. However, there is little reporting on the patient-related risk factors for tremor, risk relationship with drug concentrations, treatment strategies, and outcomes. "
"BACKGROUND: In the present study, we aimed to develop a novel isotretinoin delivery model for treating skin diseases, revealing its potential advantages in drug delivery and targeted therapy. Using a self-assembly strategy, we grafted a dendrimer, based on a well-defined branched structure for nanomedical devices, with a well-defined nanoarchitecture, yielding spherical, highly homogeneous molecules with multiple surface functionalities. Accordingly, a self-assembled dendrimer-conjugated system was developed to achieve the transdermal delivery of isotretinoin (13cRA-D). RESULTS: Herein, 13cRA-D showed remarkable controlled release, characterized by slow release in normal tissues but accelerated release in tissues with low pH, such as sites of inflammation. These release characteristics could abrogate the nonteratogenic side effects of isotretinoin and allow efficient skin permeation. Moreover, 13cRA-D exhibited high therapeutic efficacy in acne models. Based on in vitro and in vivo experimental results, 13cRA-D afforded better skin penetration than isotretinoin and allowed lesion targeting. Additionally, 13cRA-D induced minimal skin irritation. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that 13cRA-D is a safe and effective isotretinoin formulation for treating patients with skin disorders. "
"Abstract: Exposure to airborne substances such as gases, vapours, and particles remains a relevant health risk in many workplaces. A current topic and cause for discussion is the investigation of the health effects of particles containing zinc oxide (ZnO). Among other data, those collected from our study on human exposure data of ZnO in 2018 prompted the National Research Centre for the Working Environment 2021 to formulate a new, sharply lowered proposed occupational exposure limit (OEL) for zinc in workplaces. Since the publication of the Danish report, further studies have been conducted with ZnO. In the following text, all arguments for deriving this new limit value for zinc from the report are discussed, extended with the more recent data since 2018. It should be noted that especially the application of time extrapolation factors needs further discussion and harmonization between regulatory authorities. From our point of view, the data situation can justify a higher OEL for zinc than that proposed by the Danish National Research Centre for the Working Environment. "
"Abstract: Sunscreen products are composed of ultraviolet (UV) filters and formulated to reduce exposure to sunlight thereby lessening skin damage. Concerns have been raised regarding the toxicity and potential endocrine disrupting (ED) effects of UV filters. The ToxCast/Tox21 program, that is, CompTox, is a high-throughput in vitro screening database of chemicals that identify adverse outcome pathways, key events, and ED potential of chemicals. Using the ToxCast/Tox21 database, octisalate, homosalate, octocrylene, oxybenzone, octinoxate, and avobenzone, 6 commonly used organic UV filters, were found to have been evaluated. These UV filters showed low potency in these bioassays with most activity detected above the range of the cytotoxic burst. The pathways that were most affected were the cell cycle and the nuclear receptor pathways. Most activity was observed in liver and kidney-based bioassays. These organic filters and their metabolites showed relatively weak ED activity when tested in bioassays measuring estrogen receptor (ER), androgen receptor (AR), thyroid receptor, and steroidogenesis activity. Except for oxybenzone, all activity in the endocrine assays occurred at concentrations greater than the cytotoxic burst. Moreover, except for oxybenzone, plasma concentrations (Cmax) measured in humans were at least 100× lower than bioactive (AC50/ACC) concentrations that produced a response in ToxCast/Tox21 assays. These data are consistent with in vivo animal/human studies showing weak or negligible endocrine activity. In sum, when considered as part of a weight-of-evidence assessment and compared with measured plasma concentrations, the results show these organic UV filters have low intrinsic biological activity and risk of toxicity including endocrine disruption in humans. "
"Abstract: Atopic dermatitis is one of the most widespread chronic inflammatory skin conditions that can occur at any age, though the prevalence is highest in children. The purpose of the current study was to prepare and optimize the azelaic acid (AzA) loaded SNEDDS using Pseudo ternary phase diagram, which was subsequently incorporated into the Carbopol 940 hydrogel for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. The composition was evaluated for size, entrapment efficiency, in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies. The polydispersity index of the optimized preparation was found to be less than 0.5, and the size of the distributed globules was found to be 151.20 ± 3.67 nm. The SNEDDS hydrogel was characterized for pH, viscosity, spreadability, and texture analysis. When compared to the marketed formulation, SNEDDS hydrogel was found to have a higher rate of permeation through the rat skin. In addition, a skin irritation test carried out on experimental animals showed that the SNEDDS formulation did not exhibit any erythematous symptoms after a 24-h exposure. In conclusion, the topical delivery of AzA through the skin using SNEDDS hydrogel could prove to be an effective approach for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. "
"Abstract: Most patients with plaque psoriasis exhibit mild-to-moderate disease and topical therapies remain the mainstay treatment option for these patients. The use of topical steroids in combination with vitamin D analogs can produce synergistic effects and minimize adverse effects. However, due to the incompatible pH ranges of topical steroids and vitamin D analogs, combination formulations can be difficult to manufacture. Until recently, only anhydrous formulations of these 2 agents were developed as foam, gel/suspension, and ointment. However, anhydrous vehicles can often result in greasy or oily skin, thus limiting treatment adherence. Recently, Polyaphron Dispersion (PAD) technology presents a new, more cosmetically appealing vehicle that allows for both topical steroids and vitamin D analogs to coexist in an aqueous environment, such as a cream formulation. The calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate (CAL/BDP) cream enhances drug delivery by reducing the greasy and oily side effects of anhydrous formulations. Phase 3 clinical trials have demonstrated CAL/BDP cream&rsquo;s superior efficacy in treating psoriasis over gel/suspension, and the clinical trials have also shown significantly improved patient satisfaction with the cream formulation.&nbsp; &nbsp.

"PURPOSE: Bovine serum albumin (BSA) nanoparticles (BSA-MTX-CUR-NPs) encapsulating methotrexate (MTX) and curcumin (CUR) was developed with an aim to co-deliver the drugs at the inflamed joint so as to maximize the therapeutic efficacy and alleviate toxic side effects associated with MTX. METHODS: Nanoparticle albumin-bound technology was used to formulate nanoparticles, followed by characterization for its particle size, polydispersity index, encapsulation efficiency, zeta potential, surface morphology,  RESULTS: BSA-MTX-CUR-NPs exhibited particle size of 163.05 ± 1.708 nm, polydispersity index of 0.195 ± 0.0024 and % encapsulation efficiency of 68.23 ± 0.640% for MTX and 75.71 ± 0.216% for CUR with controlled release pattern for both the drugs. The scanning electron microscopy revealed nanoparticles exhibited a spherical shape. DSC study confirmed the absence of incompatibility between the drugs and the excipients. Half-life and area under the curve were significantly higher for MTX in the nanoparticulate form in comparison to free MTX. Pharmacodynamic studies revealed that BSA-MTX-CUR-NPs possessed better disease-modifying effects in comparison to free MTX. CONCLUSION: Hence, it can be concluded that albumin nanoparticles constitute a viable method for delivering MTX and CUR to inflamed joints simultaneously, because of the strong affinity of albumin and enhanced permeability and retention effect at the inflamed joint. This combinational therapy of MTX & CUR in nanoparticulate form has the potential for the holistic management of rheumatoid arthritis. "
"Abstract: Methotrexate (MTX) and diacerein (DIA) are two of the most potent disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). DIA has reflected some GIT and hepatobiliary manifestations in numerous cases. It undergoes biotransformation in the liver into the active metabolite rhein (RH) which is characterized by its excellent anti-inflammatory activity and lower side effects. However, RH's hydrophobic nature and low bioavailability do not encourage its use in RA. The current study aims to use RH in combination with MTX in targeted solid lipid nanoparticles (RH-MTX-SLNs) for better effectiveness and shadowing light on its possible mechanistic pathways. RH-MTX-SLNs were prepared and assessed for their quality attributes. The effect of the formulation was assessed in-vivo in an adjuvant arthritis animal model investigating the role of the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-induced apoptosis. Results revealed that RH-MTX-SLNs were in the suitable nanosized range with high negative zeta potential indicating good stability. In-vivo, RH-MTX-SLNs significantly improved all measured inflammatory and arthritic markers, confirmed by electron microscopy and histology examination of the joints. Besides, the formulation was able to alter the ERS-mediated apoptosis. In conclusion, RH-MTX-SLNs can represent a promising therapeutic approach for RA showing significant anti-arthritic activity. "
"OBJECTIVE: The use of biological drugs to treat ulcerative colitis (UC) represents a clear added value; nevertheless, many patients do not have a sustained response to these drugs. Small molecules were recently approved for the treatment of UC in Portugal. This network meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of the different therapies, including biological and small molecules, in patients prior exposed to biological treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed on January 6, 2022, identifying all the relevant reports about the efficacy and safety of biologics (adalimumab, golimumab, infliximab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab) and small molecules (upadacitinib, filgotinib, tofacitinib) in the treatment of UC in Portugal. Network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. Results were presented in median Odds Ratio and Surface Under the Cumulative RAnking (SUCRA) score for each treatment. RESULTS: Treatment of UC is divided into two phases: induction and maintenance. Upadacitinib 45 mg was the most efficacious therapy in achieving clinical remission and response and endoscopic improvement in the induction phase. Concerning the maintenance phase, upadacitinib 30 mg performed better than ustekinumab formulations in clinical remission and response, and endoscopic improvement. Regarding safety, there were no significant differences between all the drugs included in the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This network meta-analysis showed that upadacitinib reflects better efficacy compared to the available treatments for bio-exposed patients with moderate to severe UC. The safety profile is comparable to the other drugs. "
"Abstract: Sunscreens cover the big market ratio in terms of cosmetic applications, but the therapeutic necessity of sunscreen still needs to be uncovered in the clinical context. Clinically, sunscreens are being employed more often nowadays as a result of the rising consequences of skin malignancies and the photodamaging effects of UV radiation. Sunscreens are essential to prevent aging by shielding the skin from the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Over the recent decades, there has been a significant evolution in the usage of sunscreens as photo protectants. The demand for sunscreen formulations will inevitably rise as more people become aware of the protection that sunscreens provide against tanning, photoaging, non-melanoma skin cancers, premalignant skin lesions, and skin melanomas. The novel contemporary formulation techniques are also beneficial in enhancing the product's aesthetic look and quality. Recently, regulatory agencies have also started paying attention to the regulation of the clinical application, efficacy, and safety parameters related to sunscreen. This review underlines the pathophysiological response of UV exposure with the therapeutic applications of sunscreen in various dermatological conditions and the recent formulation advancements in the development of sunscreen.

"BACKGROUND: Facial angiofibromas (FAs) are a major feature of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Topical rapamycin can successfully treat FAs. A new stabilized cream formulation that protects rapamycin from oxidation has been developed in 0.5% and 1% concentrations. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of a novel, stabilized topical rapamycin cream formulation. METHODS: This multicentre double-blind randomized placebo-controlled dose-response phase II/III study with a parallel design included participants aged 6-65 years with FAs of mild or moderate severity according to the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scale. Participants were randomized to one of three treatment arms: topical rapamycin 0.5%, topical rapamycin 1% or placebo. Treatment was applied once daily for 26 weeks. Safety and efficacy measures were assessed at days 14, 56, 98, 140 and 182. The primary endpoint was the percentage of participants achieving IGA scores of 'clear' or 'almost clear' after 26 weeks of treatment. Secondary measures included Facial Angiofibroma Severity Index (FASI) and participant- and clinician-reported percentage-based improvement. Safety measures included the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events and blood rapamycin concentration changes over time. RESULTS: Participants (n = 107) were randomized to receive either rapamycin 1% (n = 33), rapamycin 0.5% (n = 36) or placebo (n = 38). All treated participants were included in the final analysis. The percentage of participants with a two-grade IGA improvement was greater in the rapamycin 0.5% treatment group (11%) and rapamycin 1% group (9%) than in the placebo group (5%). However, this was not statistically significant [rapamycin 0.5%: odds ratio (OR) 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-8.18 (P = 0.50); rapamycin 1%: OR 1.68, 95% CI 0.33-8.40 (P = 0.53)]. There was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of participants treated with rapamycin cream that achieved at least a one-grade improvement in IGA [rapamycin 0.5%: 56% (OR 4.73, 95% CI 1.59-14.10; P = 0.005); rapamycin 1%: 61% (OR 5.14, 95% CI 1.70-15.57; P = 0.004); placebo: 24%]. Skin adverse reactions were more common in patients following rapamycin application (64%) vs. placebo (29%). CONCLUSIONS: Both rapamycin cream formulations (0.5% and 1%) were well tolerated, and either strength could lead to clinical benefit in the treatment of FA. "
"Abstract: None Abstract: Painful diabetic neuropathy (DPN) is a serious and common problem affecting those suffering from diabetes. Current treatments of DPN include medications that act on the CNS, rather than the distally affected nerves. Topical capsaicin patches and creams offer potential as alternative treatments to centrally acting neuropathy medications. Topical capsaicin depletes the neurotransmitter for pain signaling at the distally affected nerves. Topical capsaicin in all formulations has been shown to be beneficial in reduction of DPN. However, capsaicin treatments are often irritating to the skin, causing burning and redness at the application site. "
"BACKGROUND: The fixed dose combination of calcipotriene (CAL) and betamethasone dipropionate (BDP) is a well-established topical treatment option for psoriasis based on strong scientific rationale for the single agents having complementary efficacy and safety. CAL/BDP PAD-cream is an easily spreadable cream based on PAD Technology™, an innovative formulation and drug delivery system. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: A Phase 3, multicentre, randomized, investigator-blind, active and vehicle-controlled trial enrolling 490 patients with mild to moderate psoriasis according to the Physician Global Assessment (PGA) scale was conducted in three European countries. Products were applied once daily for 8 weeks. The aim of the trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CAL/BDP PAD-cream as well as treatment acceptability compared to CAL/BDP gel and PAD-cream vehicle. Primary endpoint was percentage change in modified Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (mPASI) from baseline to Week 8. RESULTS: The percentage mean change from baseline to Week 8 in mPASI for CAL/BDP PAD-cream (67.5%) was superior compared to PAD-cream vehicle (11.7%; p < 0.0001) and non-inferior to CAL/BDP gel (63.5%). The proportion of patients achieving PGA treatment success (at least two-step improvement to clear or almost clear) after 8 weeks was superior for CAL/BDP PAD-cream (50.7%) compared to PAD-cream vehicle (6.1%, p < 0.0001) and statistically significantly greater than CAL/BDP gel (42.7%, p = 0.0442). Patient-reported psoriasis treatment convenience score (PTCS) for CAL/BDP PAD-cream was rated superior to CAL/BDP gel at Week 8 (p < 0.0001) and the mean change in DLQI from baseline to Week 8 improved statistically significantly more in the CAL/BDP PAD-cream group compared to both PAD-cream vehicle (p < 0.0001) and CAL/BDP gel (p = 0.0110). Safety assessments during the trial demonstrated that CAL/BDP PAD-cream was well-tolerated. CONCLUSION: CAL/BDP PAD-cream is a novel topical treatment of psoriasis that has a high efficacy and a favourable safety profile combined with a superior patient-reported treatment convenience. "
"Abstract: Anabolic therapies, recommended for patients at very high fracture risk, are administered subcutaneously (SC). The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the abaloparatide microstructured transdermal system (abaloparatide-sMTS) as an alternative to the SC formulation. This phase 3, noninferiority study (NCT04064411) randomly assigned postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (N = 511) 1:1 to open-label abaloparatide administered daily via abaloparatide-sMTS or SC injection for 12 months. The primary comparison between treatment groups was the percentage change in lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) at 12 months, with a noninferiority margin of 2.0%. Secondary endpoints included percentage change in total hip and femoral neck BMD, bone turnover markers, dermatologic safety, and new clinical fracture incidence. At 12 months, percentage increase from baseline in lumbar spine BMD was 7.14% (SE: 0.46%) for abaloparatide-sMTS and 10.86% (SE: 0.48%) for abaloparatide-SC (treatment difference: -3.72% [95% confidence interval: -5.01%, -2.43%]). Percentage change in total hip BMD was 1.97% for abaloparatide-sMTS and 3.70% for abaloparatide-SC. Median changes from baseline at 12 months in serum procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (s-PINP) were 52.6% for abaloparatide-sMTS and 74.5% for abaloparatide-SC. Administration site reactions were the most frequently reported adverse events (abaloparatide-sMTS, 94.4%; abaloparatide-SC, 70.5%). Incidence of serious adverse events was similar between groups. Mild or moderate skin reactions occurred with abaloparatide-sMTS with no identifiable risk factors for sensitization reactions. Few new clinical fractures occurred in either group. Noninferiority of abaloparatide-sMTS to abaloparatide-SC for percentage change in spine BMD at 12 months was not demonstrated; however, clinically meaningful increases from baseline in lumbar spine and total hip BMD were observed in both treatment groups. © 2023 Radius Health, Inc and The Authors.

"BACKGROUND: Benzoyl peroxide and tretinoin are commonly prescribed acne treatments. Historically, they have been difficult to combine in a single formulation due to chemical instability, and both medications are potentially irritating. Microencapsulation helps overcome these challenges. OBJECTIVE: Examine efficacy, safety, and tolerability of encapsulated BPO/encapsulated tretinoin (E-BPO/T) cream, 3%/0.1%. METHODS: Subjects ≥9 years old with moderate to severe acne were enrolled in 2 multicenter, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel trials and randomized (2:1) to 12 weeks of once-daily E-BPO/T (n = 571) or vehicle cream (n = 287). RESULTS: E-BPO/T was significantly superior to vehicle in both studies, with more subjects achieving IGA success with E-BPO/T (38.5%/25.4%) versus vehicle (11.5%/14.7%; P < .001/P = .017). The change from baseline in inflammatory lesion count for E-BPO/T was -21.6 versus -14.8 for vehicle (P < .001) in study 1 and -16.2 versus -14.1 (P = .018) in study 2. The changes from baseline in noninflammatory lesions for E-BPO/T were -29.7 versus -19.8 for vehicle (P < .001) and -24.2 and -17.4 (P < .001) in studies 1 and 2, respectively. E-BPO/T was well tolerated in both studies. LIMITATIONS: Long-term data are not available. CONCLUSION: E-BPO/T provided statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in IGA and inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts and was well tolerated in subjects with moderate to severe acne.

"Abstract: Over the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the use of sunscreens. Consequently, the occurrence in aquatic environments of ultraviolet filters has also increased. The present study aims to evaluate the toxicity of two commercial sunscreens to the aquatic snail Biomphalaria glabrata. Acute assays were performed with adult snails exposed to solutions of the two products in synthetic soft water. Reproduction and development assays were carried out, involving individual adult and egg masses exposure to assess fertility and embryonic development. Sunscreen A showed a LC "
"Abstract: An oral galactosylated carboxymethyl chitosan polymeric nanomicelles (Gal-N-CMCS NPs) embedded in chitosan-alginate hydrogel (CA-Gel) was developed to load cyclosporine A (CyA) as therapeutic agents against ulcerative colitis (UC). Galactose modified CMCS with macrophage targeting characteristic and CyA via a simple ultrasonication method to form Gal-N-CMCS/CyA NPs, and mixed CA-Gel to acquire the final formulation (Gal-N-CMCS/CyA Gel). The generated Gal-N-CMCS/CyA NPs displayed a desirable particle size (206.8 nm), negative surface charge (-19.5 mV), and high encapsulating efficiency (89.6 %). The morphology and release profiles were also charactered by transmission electron microscope [1] and dialysis method, respectively. Strikingly, the mucus penetration of Gal-N-CMCS/CyA NPs exceeded 90 % within 90 min. The Gal-N-CMCS NPs internalized by macrophages were 3.3-fold higher than CMCS-N NPs, thereby, enhancing the anti-inflammatory activities of NPs. Meanwhile, these NPs exhibited excellent biocompatibility, reduced the toxic effect of CyA, and targeting ability on inflammatory macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. Most importantly, in vivo studies revealed that CyA NPs could efficiently target the inflamed colon, remarkably alleviate inflammation, repair mucosal and reconstructed colonic epithelial barriers in UC mice induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) via Toll-like receptor 4 -Nuclear factor kappa-B (TLR4-NF-κB) pathway. Our findings suggest that these high-performance and facilely fabricated Gal-N-CMCS/CyA NPs could be developed as a promising drug carrier for oral UC treatment. "
"Abstract: Numerous adverse effects on human health have been reported in epidemiological studies of oleoresin capsicum (OC) and other riot control agents (RCAs). Importantly, the daunting risk of such RCAs can be neutralized by optimizing the desired concentration of such agents for mob dispersal. Hence, a nonlethal riot control combinational formulation (NCF) was prepared for dispersing rioters without imparting fatal outcomes. However, for desired utilization of NCF, it is essential to recognize its extent of potential toxicity. Therefore, the current investigation evaluated the dermal toxicity of NCF using experimental animals in compliance with the OECD guidelines. Additionally, few essential metal ions were analyzed and found non -significantly different in the test rats as compared to control rats. Moreover, abnormal dermal morphology and lesions ultrastructural tissue defects were not noticed as evinced by different studies like ultrasonography, histology, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) respectively. Further, Doppler ultrasonography exhibited non-significantly different blood flow velocity in both groups, whereas miles test demonstrated a significantly increased Evans blue concentration in test rats compared to the control rats, which might be due to an initial increase in blood flow via an instant action of the NCF at the cutaneous sensory nerve endings. However, our results demonstrated NCF can produce initial skin irritating and sensitizing effects in guinea pigs and rabbits without the antecedence of acute toxicity (≤2000 mg/kg) in Wistar rats. "
"Abstract: Over the years, extensive research has been carried out to develop new chemical entities for hair loss treatment. Despite these efforts, the newly developed topical and oral treatments have not proven to be curative. Hair loss can result from underlying mechanisms, such as inflammation and apoptosis around hair follicles. We have developed a nanoemulsion based on Pemulen gel for topical application, tentatively addressing both mechanisms. The novel formulation contains two well-known molecules: Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressant calcineurin inhibitor, and Tempol, a potent antioxidant. The in vitro permeation study on human skin revealed that the CsA-Tempol gel formulation effectively delivered CsA into the skin's inner target layer, the dermis. The effects of the CsA-Tempol gel on hair regrowth were further demonstrated in the in vivo well-established androgenetic model induced in female C57BL/6 mice. The beneficial outcome was statistically confirmed by quantitative analysis of hair regrowth, measured by color density. The results were further supported by histology analysis. Our findings revealed a topical synergy effect, resulting in lower therapeutic concentrations of both actives unlikely to cause systemic side effects. Overall, our research suggests that the CsA-Tempol gel is a highly promising platform for treating alopecia. "
"Abstract: Major challenges in current cancer chemotherapy include drug resistance, low efficacy and non-selectivity, resulting in undesirable side effects. In this study, we demonstrate a solution to these challenges that involves a dual targeting approach for tumors that overexpress CD44 receptors. The approach employs a nano-formulation (tHAC-MTX nano assembly), fabricated from hyaluronic acid (HA), the natural ligand for CD44, conjugated with methotrexate (MTX) and complexed with the thermoresponsive polymer 6-O-carboxymethylchitosan (6-OCMC) graft poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) [6-OCMC-g-PNIPAAm]. The thermoresponsive component was designed to have a lower critical solution temperature of 39 °C (the temperature of tumor tissues). In-vitro drug release studies reveal faster release of the drug at the higher temperatures of the tumor tissue likely due to the conformation changes in the thermoresponsive component of the nano assembly. Drug release was also enhanced in the presence of hyaluronidase enzyme. Higher cellular uptake and greater cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles were demonstrated in cancer cells that overexpress CD44 receptors suggesting a receptor binding and cellular uptake mechanism. Such nano-assemblies which incorporate multiple targeting mechanisms have the potential to improve efficacy and decrease side effects of cancer chemotherapy. "
"Abstract: Acne is a prevalent chronic inflammatory disease that can cause severe psychiatric effects and physical scarring of the skin. Historically, although systemic antiandrogen acne medications have been effective in women, the utility of these systemic medications has been limited due to potential systemic side effects in men and pregnant women. Therefore, research has been focused on developing topical formulations of antiandrogen therapy for acne. Topical clascoterone cream 1% is the first topical anti-androgen medication approved for the treatment of acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older and represents a breakthrough in acne treatment. Clascoterone, or cortexolone-17&alpha; propionate, is an androgen receptor inhibitor with highly localized activity. Thismedication is thought to compete with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for androgen receptors located in pilosebaceous units, thus inhibiting the acnegenic downstream effects of DHT such as lipid synthesis and inflammatory cytokine production in a dose-dependent manner. Two phase III clinical trials have been conducted thus far; both trials have shown clascoterone 1% cream applied BID to be significantly more effective than placebo cream at treating acne vulgaris in patients ages 12 and older with moderate-to-severe acne. Clascoterone has also been shown to have a similar safety profile to that of placebo cream in clinical studies, without any systemic antiandrogenic effects observed in the clinical setting. Due to its novel mechanism of action and activity limited to the skin, clascoterone presents an exciting opportunity for dermatologists to further optimize care for eligible acne patients, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other anti-acne medications.

"Abstract: Novel nanomaterial-based pesticide formulations are increasingly perceived as promising aids in the transition to more efficient agricultural production systems. The current understanding of potential unintended (eco)toxicological impacts of nano-formulated pesticides is scarce, in particular with regard to (non-target) aquatic organisms and ecosystems. The present study reports the results of a long-term freshwater mesocosm experiment which assessed responses of individual zooplankton taxa and communities to a novel TiO "
"Abstract: Personal care products have various organic ultraviolet filters (UV filters) in their composition to increase protection against ultraviolet radiation. Some of these products also contain insect repellents in their formulations. Consequently, these compounds reach freshwater ecosystems, exposing aquatic organisms to a cocktail of anthropogenic contaminants. In this study, the joint effects of two most frequently detected UV filters (Benzophenone - 3 (BP3) and Enzacamene (4-MBC)) and joint effects of BP3 combined with an insect repellent (N, N diethyl-3-methylbenzamide - DEET) were evaluated using life-history traits of the aquatic midge Chironomus riparius such as emergence rate, time to emergence and imagoes body weight. The results showed synergistic effects between BP3 and 4-MBC for C. riparius emergence rate. Regarding the effects of BP3 and DEET mixture, our analysis suggests synergism in the case of males but antagonism in the case of females' time to emergence. Our results imply that the effects of UV filters present in sediments within chemical mixtures are complex and that the evaluation of effects using different life-history traits can yield different patterns of responses. This study demonstrates the importance of assessing the combined effects of pollutants used/found concomitantly in aquatic systems for a more accurate risk assessment, as individual chemical testing can underestimate the toxicity of organic UV filters.

"BACKGROUND: After decades of use, methotrexate displays an established safety and efficacy profile in both in-hospital and outpatient settings. Despite its widespread use, there is surprisingly little clinical evidence to guide daily practice with methotrexate in dermatology. OBJECTIVES: To provide guidance for clinicians in daily practice for areas in which there is limited guidance. METHODS: A Delphi consensus exercise on 23 statements was carried out on the use of methotrexate in dermatological routine settings. RESULTS: Consensus was reached on statements that cover six main areas: (1) pre-screening exams and monitoring of therapy; (2) dosing and administration in patients naïve to methotrexate; (3) optimal strategy for patients in remission; (4) use of folic acid; (5) safety; and (6) predictors of toxicity and efficacy. Specific recommendations are provided for all 23 statements. CONCLUSIONS: In order to optimize methotrexate efficacy, it is essential to optimize treatment using appropriate dosages, carrying out a rapid drug-based step-up on a treat-to-target strategy and preferably using the subcutaneous formulation. To manage safety aspects appropriately, it is essential to evaluate patients' risk factors and carry out proper monitoring during the course of treatment. "
"Abstract: The present study evaluates the biocompatibility of silver and zinc oxide nanoparticles with various effective microorganisms (EM), like beneficial microbial formulations. The respective nanoparticle was synthesised by chemical reduction of metal precursor with reducer via simple route green technology principles. The synthesised nanoparticles were characterised by UV visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies, revealing highly stable, nanoscale particles with marked crystallinity. EM-like beneficial cultures composed of viable cells of Lactobacillus lactis, Streptomyces sp, Candida lipolytica, and Aspergillus oryzae were formulated with rice bran, sugarcane syrup, and groundnut cake. The respective formulation was inoculated into the nanoparticles amalgamated pots raised with green gram seedlings. Biocompatibility was determined by measuring plant growth parameters of a green gram at pre-determined periods associated with enzymatic antioxidants like catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione S transferase (GST) levels. Most significantly, the expression level of these enzymatic antioxidants level was also investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The impact of the soil conditioning effect on soil nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, organic carbon, soil enzymes glucosidases, and β-xylosidases activity was also studied. Among the formulation, rice bran-groundnut cake-sugar syrup formulation recorded the best biocompatibility. This formulation showed high growth promotion, soil conditioning effect and no impact on the oxidative stress enzymes genes that revealed the best compatibility of nanoparticles. This study concluded that biocompatible, eco-friendly formulations of microbial inoculants could be used for the desirable agro active properties that show extreme tolerance or biocompatibility to the nanoparticles. This present study also suggests the utilisation of the above said beneficial microbial formulation and metal-based nanoparticles with desirable agro active properties in a synergistic manner due to their high tolerance or compatibility towards the metal or metal oxide nanoparticles.

"Abstract: It is well known that the prolonged exposure to UV radiation from sunlight can compromise human health and is particularly damaging to the skin, leading to sunburn, photo-aging and skin cancer. Sunscreen formulations containing UV-filters present a barrier against solar UV and help to mitigate the harmful effects however, concern about their safety for both human and environmental health is still a much-debated topic. EC regulations classify UV-filters depending on their chemical nature, particle size, and mechanism of action. Furthermore, it regulates their use in cosmetic products with specific limitations in terms of concentration (organic UV filters) and particle size and surface modification to reduce their photo-activity (mineral UV filters). The regulations have prompted researchers to identify new materials that show promise for use in sunscreens. In this work, biomimetic hybrid materials composed of titanium-doped hydroxyapatite (TiHA) grown on two different organic templates, derived from animal (gelatin - from pig skin) and vegetable (alginate - from algae) sources. These novel materials were developed and characterized to obtain sustainable UV-filters as a safer alternative for both human and ecosystem health. This 'biomineralization' process yielded TiHA nanoparticles that demonstrated high UV reflectance, low photoactivity, good biocompatibility and an aggregate morphology which prevents dermal penetration. The materials are safe for topical application and for the marine environment; moreover, they can protect organic sunscreen components from photodegradation and yield long-lasting protection. "

"Abstract: This audience segmentation of visitors at coastal parks in Hawaii and North Carolina addresses an emergent natural resource management concern and risk to aquatic ecosystems: sunscreen chemical pollution. Four audiences were identified that correspond to different behavioral profiles: sunscreen protection tourists, multimodal sun protection tourists, in-state frequent park visitors, and frequent beachgoers who skip sunscreen. The second-largest audience, sunscreen protection tourists, represents 29% of visitors at Cape Lookout National Seashore and 25% at Kaloko-Honokōhau National Historical Park. This group ranks of most concern for chemical pollution because they use sunscreen, but not typically mineral formulations or other methods such as protective clothing, and they have lower levels of sunscreen chemical issue awareness. The identification of similar audience segments across regions with differing cultural characteristics and sunscreen regulation status suggests the robustness of the model and its indicator variables, with implications for both environmental protection and public health. Further, coastal visitors' interest in enacting pro-environmental sun protection behaviors during their next park or beach visit indicates the potential for natural resource managers to holistically address risks in both domains through targeted interventions with audiences of most concern.

"Abstract: Although the efficacy of Cyclosporine A (CsA) in the management of ocular inflammation is well-demonstrated, ocular delivery remains challenging due to its hydrophobic nature. The semifluorinated alkane, perfluorobutylpentane (F4H5) has previously been suggested as an efficient vehicle for preparation of CsA eyedrops. Here we evaluated the influence of drop volume and the formulation aid, ethanol (EtOH), on ocular penetration of CsA and compared it to that of the commercial eyedrop, Ikervis, ex vivo and in vivo. Moreover, conjunctival and corneal tolerability after EtOH addition were evaluated ex vivo. The F4H5/EtOH vehicle was well tolerated and resulted in better corneal CsA penetration (AUC "
"Abstract: Hair loss or alopecia is a common dermatological condition affecting up to 2% of the world population. It is often caused by hereditary factors, such as male or female pattern baldness, but it can also result from various environmental factors, an unbalanced diet, or chronic illness. While hair loss is not life-threatening, it can cause significant anxiety, depression, and other psychological problems, ultimately impacting an individual's quality of life. Various treatments for hair loss, including both synthetic drugs, such as minoxidil and finasteride, or medicinal herbs, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Despite synthetic drugs' effectiveness, they may come with potential side effects. Natural remedies have been proposed as a viable option for treating hair loss because many chronic disorders can cause alopecia. As such, this review focuses on identifying alternative, efficient treatment agents with limited side effects. Specifically, it looks into medicinal plants as potential healing agents for treating hair loss. To gather relevant information for the study, multiple databases were searched, including Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar. A comprehensive search was conducted using a range of search terms, such as ""hair loss"", ""alopecia"", ""natural remedies for hair loss"", ""herbal treatments for hair loss"", and others to extract relevant scientific articles. Many medicinal plants and natural compounds have shown potential in reducing hair loss, thanks to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and the ability to improve local metabolism when applied externally. According to existing literature, herbal extracts and formulations derived from plants, such as  "
"INTRODUCTION: Methotrexate shows high efficiency in the treatment of Rheumatoid arthritis, but its adverse effects cannot be tolerated by many patients. Additionally, Methotrexate suffers from rapid clearance from blood. Polymeric nanoparticles were used to solve these problems including chitosan. METHODS: Herein, a new nanoparticulate system to deliver Methotrexate (MTX) using chitosan nanoparticles (CS NPs) was developed to be used transdermally. CS NPs were prepared and characterized. The drug release was studied  RESULTS: The results showed that CS NPs were monodispersed, and spherical with a size of 279.9 nm and a charge above ± 30mV. Further, 88.02% of MTX was entrapped in the NPs. CS NPs prolonged MTX release and enhanced its permeation (apparent permeability ⁓35.00cm/h) and retention (retention capacity ⁓12.01%) through rats' skin. The transdermal delivery of MTX-CS NPs improves the progress of the disease compared to free MTX, as reflected by the lower arthritic index values, lower proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6), and higher anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) in the synovial fluid. Further, the oxidative stress activities were significantly higher in the group treated with the MTX-CS NPs, as indicated by GSH. Finally, MTX-CS NPs were more effective in reducing lipid peroxidation in synovial fluid. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, loading Methotrexate in chitosan nanoparticles controlled its release and enhance its effectiveness against rheumatoid when applied dermally. "
"AIMS: In this work, CS NPs were prepared by the ionic gelation method and encapsulated with MTX to treat psoriasis dermally. BACKGROUND: A major drawback of using MTX to treat psoriasis is its limited diffusion through the skin, which may cause insufficient penetration of MTX into the basal layer of the epidermis, where psoriatic cells are generated. OBJECTIVE: Nanoparticles have been used to enhance MTX diffusion through the skin. The system prepared in this work is expected to direct the drug to psoriasis cells by enhancing the drug diffusion through the skin, which will increase the amount of the drug reaching the epidermis. This is expected to enhance the effectiveness of the drug and to decrease its systemic side effects. METHODS: Five formulations of Chitosan nanoparticles were prepared and loaded with Methotrexate using the ionic gelation technique. Particle size, dispersity, charge, loading capacity and encapsulation efficacy were measured. Characterization of prepared nanoparticles was conducted to confirm the formation of CS-NPs, successful encapsulation of MTX and its compatibility with other formulation components.  RESULTS: The results showed that the sizes ranged from 132.13 ± 0.70 to 300.60 ± 4.81 nm, where SEM demonstrated the spherical and uniform distribution of the NPs. The surface charge of all NPs was highly positive and ranged from 20.22 ± 1.10 to 30.90 ± 0.70 mV. Further, the EE% and LC% of the nanoparticles were in the range of 77.72%-92.70% and 17.90%-21.81%, respectively.  CONCLUSION: In conclusion, MTX-CS NPs can be used to enhance the treatment of psoriasis topically. "
"Abstract: Human skin needs additional protection from damaging ultraviolet radiation (UVR: 280-400 nm). Harmful UVR exposure leads to DNA damage and the development of skin cancer. Available sunscreens offer chemical protection from detrimental sun radiation to a certain extent. However, many synthetic sunscreens do not provide sufficient UVR protection due to the lack of photostability of their UV-absorbing active ingredients and/or the lack of ability to prevent the formation of free radicals, inevitably leading to skin damage. In addition, synthetic sunscreens may negatively affect human skin, causing irritation, accelerating skin aging and even resulting in allergic reactions. Beyond the potential negative effect on human health, some synthetic sunscreens have been shown to have a harmful impact on the environment. Consequently, identifying photostable, biodegradable, non-toxic, and renewable natural UV filters is imperative to address human health needs and provide a sustainable environmental solution. In nature, marine, freshwater, and terrestrial organisms are protected from harmful UVR through several important photoprotective mechanisms, including the synthesis of UV-absorbing compounds such as mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs). Beyond MAAs, several other promising, natural UV-absorbing products could be considered for the future development of natural sunscreens. This review investigates the damaging impact of UVR on human health and the necessity of using sunscreens for UV protection, specifically UV-absorbing natural products that are more environmentally friendly than synthetic UV filters. Critical challenges and limitations related to using MAAs in sunscreen formulations are also evaluated. Furthermore, we explain how the genetic diversity of MAA biosynthetic pathways may be linked to their bioactivities and assess MAAs' potential for applications in human health. "
"BACKGROUND: The recent removal of hydroquinone from the over-the-counter market has created a need for modern skin lightening formulations. An effective pigment lightening formulation must be non-irritating to prevent skin darkening from post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, penetration enhanced to reach the epidermal/dermal junction, contain anti-inflammatory ingredients, and address multiple mechanisms of pigment production. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research was to demonstrate the efficacy of a topical multimodal pigment lightening preparation containing tranexamic acid, niacinamide, and licorice. METHODS: Fifty female subjects 18+ years of all Fitzpatrick skin types with mild to moderate facial dyspigmentation were enrolled. Subjects were provided with the study product for twice daily use on the entire face and an SPF50 sunscreen with evaluations occurring at Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week 16. The investigator used a face map to identify a pigmented target site on the face for dermaspectrophotometer (DSP) measurement. The dermatologist investigator completed a baseline facial efficacy and tolerability assessment. The subjects completed a tolerability assessment. RESULTS: 48/50 subjects completed the study without tolerability issues. The DSP readings demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in target spot pigmentation at Week 16. The investigator assessed a 37% decrease in pigment intensity, a 31% decrease in pigment extent, a 30% decrease in pigment homogeneity, a 45% improvement in brightness, a 42% improvement in clarity, and a 32% improvement in overall facial skin dyspigmentation at Week 16. CONCLUSION: The combination of penetration enhanced tranexamic acid, niacinamide, and licorice was effective in inducing facial pigment lightening. "
"AIM: The aim of the study is to evaluate the embryonic toxicology of ginger- and clove-mediated titanium oxide (TiO MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dental varnish was formulated using ginger, clove extract, and titanium dioxide NPs followed by the introduction of this test solution at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 µL along with a control group with medium zebrafish embryos into a 6-well culture plate. After 2 hours of incubation, the embryos of zebrafish were tested and analyzed for hatchability and mortality rate using one-way ANOVA and  RESULTS: The hatching rate of zebrafish embryos was greatest at 1 µL in a declining order when compared to the control group, whereas the mortality rate was greatest at 16 µL compared to the control group. On intergroup comparisons, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) has revealed a significance ( CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of the study, the zebrafish embryos exposed acutely to TiO CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Research and development of new formulations of various dental products is an ongoing process. One such segment is dental varnishes, wherein herbal resources and NPs mediated for improved efficacy against dental caries is an emerging alternative aiming to counteract the limitations posed by the traditional agents. To develop a new formulation of dental varnish, which is herbal resourced and NPs mediated, for an improved efficacy against dental caries. "
"INTRODUCTION: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common disease with an important impact on the quality of life and very high management costs. In many patients, the poor control of rhinitis symptoms often requires the use of different drugs, and polytherapy tends to reduce therapeutic adherence. According to the latest version of ARIA guidelines, the currently recommended drugs for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AR are second-generation antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids, and their combination, even in a single nasal spray device. A single medication with a rapid onset of action, acting on breakthrough symptoms too, would be advantageous, also in terms of patient compliance. AREAS COVERED: GSP301 (olopatadine 600 µg - mometasone furoate 25 µg) is a novel intranasal formulation, combining the second-generation antihistamine olopatadine hydrochloride with mometasone furoate. Here, we review the evidence for GSP301, especially concerning the efficacy and safety profile of this intranasal combination in the treatment of AR. EXPERT OPINION: The evidence provided in the current review clearly supports the use of GSP301 as a novel intranasal corticosteroid/antihistamine combination with a well-documented efficacy and safety profile in terms of rapid symptom relief and good tolerability. "
"Abstract: Flavored electronic cigarettes (ECs) present a serious health challenge globally. Currently, it is unknown whether the addition of highly popular menthol flavoring to e-liquid is associated with changes in the number of aerosolized particles generated or altered lung function. Here, we first performed preclinical studies using our novel robotic platform Human Vaping Mimetic Real-Time Particle Analyzer (HUMITIPAA). HUMITIPAA generates fresh aerosols for any desired EC in a very controlled and user-definable manner and utilizes an optical sensing system to quantitate and analyze sub-micron and microparticles from every puff over the course of vaping session in real-time while emulating clinically relevant breathing mechanics and vaping topography. We discovered that addition of menthol flavoring to freshly prepared e-liquid base propylene glycol-vegetable glycerin leads to enhanced particle counts in all tested size fractions, similar to the effect of adding vitamin E acetate to e-liquid we previously reported. Similarly, we found that menthol vs. non-menthol (tobacco) flavored pods from commercially available ECs leads to generation of significantly higher quantities of 1-10 µm particles upon inhalation. We then retrospectively analyzed data from the COPDGene study and identified an association between the use of menthol flavored ECs and reduced FEV1% predicted and FEV1/FVC independent of age, gender, race, pack-years of smoking, and use of nicotine or cannabis-containing vaping products. Our results reveal an association between enhanced inhaled particle due to menthol addition to ECs and worse lung function indices. Detailed causal relation remains to be demonstrated in future large-scale prospective clinical studies. Importantly, here we demonstrate utility of the HUMITIPAA as a predictive enabling technology to identify inhalation toxicological potential of emerging ECs as the chemical formulation of e-liquid gets modified.

"BACKGROUND: Lasers require several sessions to achieve significant results and may lead to adverse reactions. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy is a good adjuvant to laser therapies; however, repeated blood extractions and invasive injections are needed. A 100% autologous topical formulation based on the patient's proteins has been recently developed, known as Endoret-Serum (ES). Unlike other PRPs, ES provides a home care, storable, and topical needle-free application. OBJECTIVE: Preliminarily assess the clinical performance of a single session of the combined therapy with nonablative laser and ES in the management of cutaneous pigmented and vasculature lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine patients with clinical signs of skin aging received a single session of nonablative laser. ES was topically applied twice daily. They were clinically assessed after 1 and 8 weeks. VISIA-CR System was used for high-resolution topographic analysis. Subjects were asked to complete a self-assessment questionnaire and an impression of improvement survey. An investigator's global assessment scale was fulfilled. RESULTS: The combined treatment improved cutaneous spots, wrinkles, and texture after 8 weeks, whereas significant pore reduction was observable at 1 week. Ultraviolet (UV) spots and porphyrins decreased at 1 week, whereas red area improvement was noticeable after 8 weeks. Overall wrinkle amelioration, periorbital hyperpigmentation decrease, softened skin, and tone recovery was observed. Patients referred to be very satisfied and felt that their cutaneous condition was much better. At the end of the study, subjects presented minimal dermatological symptoms like pigmented lesions, redness, or capillaries. No side effects were reported. CONCLUSION: Results presented herein suggest that one session of laser in combination with ES provides a good clinical outcome. "
"OBJECTIVE: There is an urgent need for safe and targeted interventions to mitigate post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP). Calcineurin inhibitors (CnIs) offer therapeutic promise as calcineurin signaling within acinar cells is a key initiating event in PEP. In previous proof-of-concept studies using experimental models, we showed that concurrent intra-pancreatic ductal administration of the CnIs, tacrolimus (Tac) or cyclosporine A (CsA) with the ERCP radiocontrast agent (RC) prevented PEP. To translate this finding clinically, we investigated potential toxic effects of intraductal delivery of a single-dose RC-CnI formulation on endocrine pancreas function and systemic toxicities in a preclinical PEP model. METHODS: C57BL/6J mice underwent ductal cannulation and received a single, intra-pancreatic ductal infusion of RC or RC with Tac or CsA (treatment groups) or underwent ductal cannulation without infusion ('sham' group). To assess endocrine function, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) was performed at two days before infusion and on day 2 and 14 post-surgery. To evaluate off-target tissue toxicities, renal and hepatic function-related parameters including blood urea nitrogen, plasma creatinine, potassium, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin were measured at the same time-points as IPGTT. Histological and biochemical indicators of pancreas injury and inflammation were also evaluated. RESULTS: No abnormalities in glucose metabolism, hepatic or renal function were observed on day 2 or 14 in mice administered with intraductal RC or RC with Tac or CsA. CONCLUSION: Intraductal delivery of RC-CnI formulation was safe and well-tolerated with no significant acute or subacute endocrine or systemic toxicities, underscoring its clinical utility to prevent PEP.

"PURPOSE: There has been a growing interest in the use of probiotics and their products for skin care, over the last decade. LactoSporin is the extracellular metabolite of a spore-forming probiotic  PATIENTS AND METHODS: The anti-skin-aging potential of LactoSporin was evaluated in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in healthy female participants (70 screened and 56 randomized). The participants applied either LactoSporin or matched placebo formulation (N=28 in each group) for 10 weeks, and the effects were assessed by dermatological, and non-invasive instrument-based evaluation using Antera, Cutometer, Corneometer, and Tewameter. All the 56 participants completed the study and were included for the analysis. RESULTS: The regular use of LactoSporin cream for 10 weeks showed a significant reduction in visibility of wrinkles around crow's feet, nasolabial folds, frown lines, and facial fine lines compared to baseline and placebo by dermatological and Antera assessments. LactoSporin showed improvement in skin elasticity and hydration by dermatological assessments, but the effect was not significantly different from placebo when assessed by Cutometer, Corneometer, and Tewameter. No adverse events or skin irritation was observed in any participants during the study. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that LactoSporin could be a safe natural ingredient to reduce wrinkles and fine lines in cosmetic formulations. "
"BACKGROUND: Methotrexate is an anticancer drug from the antimetabolite class. It is also used in gynecology and obstetrics for the medical treatment of ectopic pregnancies. Low-dose methotrexate-induced adverse toxic effects are rare. We report a case of toxic effect associated with severe renal insufficiency induced by LD-MTX (Low-Dose Methotrexate) for ectopic pregnancy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old Chinese woman was in an operation for an ectopic pregnancy of tubal interstitial pregnancy. The embryo villus was so little that we were not sure if it was evacuated, then it was followed with 50 mg methotrexate injection of intramuscular adjacent the uterine horn in the operation. 48 hour later after injection the patient presented with renal failure. The personalized genetic testing showed that MTHFR (677C > T) and ABCB1 (3435T > C) were detected. Gradually, the symptoms improved after calcium leucovorin (CF) rescue, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), promoting blood system regeneration, and multiple supportive treatments. CONCLUSIONS: When toxic effects are suspected, detecting the polymorphisms of an MTHFR gene and monitoring MTX concentration in blood could assist us to formulate individualized and active treatments. The management should be multidisciplinary and as much as possible within an intensive care unit. "
"Abstract: Excessive UV radiation exposure is harmful to skin cells since sunburn is accompanied by oxidative burst, leading to a rapid increase in skin cancer. However, the insufficient UV photoprotection of approved sunscreens and the negative impact of their compositions on ecosystems and human health makes the utility of sunscreen a questionable recommendation. Therefore, discovering UV filters with significant antioxidant activity and improved topical performance and photostability is an urgent need. Recently, the use of nanosized natural molecules incorporated in sunscreens has been a scientific hot topic, as it has been suggested that they provide a synergistic effect with synthetic UV filters, improving overall SPF and antioxidant activity, higher retention on the epidermis, and less toxicity. The aim of this review was to verify the usefulness of sunscreens incorporating flavonoid-loaded nanoparticles. A literature review was performed, where original and review articles published in the last 6 years were analyzed. Formulations containing nanosized flavonoids with improved UVA photoprotection and safer toxicological profiles, associated or not with synthetic filters, are promising sunscreens and more clinical investigation must be performed to validate these findings.

"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Topical clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/benzoyl peroxide 3.1%/adapalene 0.15% gel (IDP-126) is the first fixed-dose triple-combination formulation in development for acne. This post hoc analysis investigated efficacy and safety of IDP-126 in children and adolescents with moderate-to-severe acne. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind phase 2 study (NCT03170388), participants ≥9 years of age with moderate-to-severe acne were eligible for randomization (1:1:1:1:1) to once-daily IDP-126, one of three dyad combination gels, or vehicle gel for 12 weeks. This post hoc analysis of pediatric participants (n = 394) included children and adolescents up to 17 years of age. Assessments included treatment success, inflammatory/noninflammatory lesion counts, Acne-Specific Quality of Life (Acne-QoL) questionnaire, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and cutaneous safety/tolerability. RESULTS: At Week 12, treatment success rates were significantly greater with IDP-126 (55.8%) than with vehicle (5.7%; p < .001) or any of the dyad combinations (range: 30.8%-33.9%; p < .01, all). Lesion reductions with IDP-126 were also significantly greater than with vehicle (inflammatory: 78.3% vs. 45.1%; noninflammatory: 70.0% vs. 37.6%; p < .001, both) and 9.2%-16.6% greater than with any of the dyad combinations. Increases (improvements) from baseline in Acne-QoL domain scores were generally greater with IDP-126 than in any other treatment group. The most common treatment-related TEAEs across treatment groups were application site pain and dryness. Most treatment-related TEAEs were of mild-to-moderate severity. CONCLUSION: IDP-126 gel-a novel fixed-dose, triple-combination topical formulation for acne-demonstrated superior efficacy to vehicle and three dyad component gels and was well tolerated in children and adolescents with moderate-to-severe acne.

"BACKGROUND: Acne pathophysiology includes a complex interaction among inflammatory mediators, hyperseborrhea, alteration of keratinization and follicular colonization by Propionibacterium acnes. AIMS: To describe the impact of the exposome on acne and how photoprotection can improve outcomes. METHODS: A narrative review of the literature was carried out; searches with Google Scholar and Pubmed from January 1992 to November 2022 were performed. The keywords used were ""acne,"" ""sunscreens,"" ""photoprotection,"" ""cosmetics,"" ""cosmeceuticals,"" ""pathogenesis,"" ""etiology,"" ""exposome,"" ""sunlight,"" ""stress,"" ""lack of sleep,"" ""diet,"" ""postinflammatory hyperpigmentation,"" ""pollution,"" ""exposome,"" ""ultraviolet radiation,"" and ""visible light."" RESULTS: Environmental factors such as solar radiation, air pollution, tobacco consumption, psychological stress, diverse microorganisms, nutrition, among others, can trigger or worsen acne. Solar radiation can temporarily improve lesions. However, it can induce proinflammatory and profibrotic responses, and produce post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and/or post-inflammatory erythema. While photoprotection is widely recommended to acne patients, only four relevant studies were found. Sunscreens can significantly improve symptomatology or enhance treatment and can prevent post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Furthermore, they can provide camouflage and improve quality of life. Based on acne pathogenesis, optimal sunscreens should have emollient, antioxidant and sebum controlling properties. CONCLUSIONS: The exposome and solar radiation can trigger or worsen acne. UV light can induce post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation/erythema, and can initiate flares. The use of specifically formulated sunscreens could enhance adherence to topical or systemic therapy, camouflage lesions (tinted sunscreens), decrease inflammation, and reduce the incidence of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation/erythema.

"BACKGROUND: Emollients and keratolytics are frequently used to manage symptoms of congenital ichthyosis (CI). Systemic retinoid treatment is complicated by teratogenicity and dose-limiting adverse effects. OBJECTIVES: This analysis from the randomized Phase IIb CONTROL study investigated the characteristics of participants who responded to treatment with TMB-001, a novel topical isotretinoin ointment formulation. METHODS: Participants ≥ 9 years of age with genetically confirmed CI and ≥ 2 (out of 4) Visual Index for Ichthyosis Severity (VIIS) assessment areas with ≥ 3 scaling score were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to TMB-001 0.05%, TMB-001 0.1% or vehicle, twice daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy endpoints included the proportion of participants with ≥ 50% reduction in VIIS-scaling (VIIS-50) compared with baseline and ≥ 2-grade reduction in Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA)-scaling score compared with baseline. Changes in body surface area (BSA) involvement, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores and Itch-Numeric Rating Scale (I-NRS) scores were assessed. RESULTS: Among the 33 participants (11 randomized to TMB-001 0.05%, 10 to TMB-001 0.1% and 12 to vehicle), median age was 29 years (range 9-80), and most were male (64%) and White (79%). Baseline demographics were generally similar among participants who did or did not achieve TMB-001 treatment success. Participants who had lower mean BSA involvement and higher DLQI and I-NRS scores at baseline were more likely to achieve VIIS-50. Similarly, higher baseline DLQI and I-NRS scores were associated with IGA response; BSA involvement was similar for IGA responders vs. nonresponders. CONCLUSIONS: Higher DLQI and I-NRS scores at baseline were associated with participants achieving treatment success by VIIS-50 and IGA response. Lower BSA involvement was associated with VIIS-50 success. "
"Abstract: Actinic keratosis (AK) is among the most commonly diagnosed skin diseases with potentially life-threatening repercussions if left untreated. Usage of pharmacologic agents represents one of many therapeutic strategies that can be used to help manage these lesions. Ongoing research into these compounds continues to change our clinical understanding as to which agents most benefit particular patient populations. Indeed, factors such as past personal medical history, lesion location and tolerability of therapy only represent a few considerations that clinicians must account for when prescribing appropriate treatment. This review focuses on specific drugs used in either the prevention or treatment of AKs. Nicotinamide, acitretin and topical 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) continue to be used with fidelity in the chemoprevention of actinic keratosis, although some uncertainty persists in regard to which agents should be used in immunocompetent vs. immunodeficient/immunosuppressed patients. Topical 5-FU, including combination formulations with either calcipotriol or salicylic acid, as well as imiquimod, diclofenac and photodynamic light therapy are all accepted treatment strategies employed to target and eliminate AKs. Five percent of 5-FU is regarded as the most effective therapy in the condition, although the literature has conflictingly shown that lower concentrations of the drug might also be as effective. Topical diclofenac (3%) appears to be less efficacious than 5% 5-FU, 3.75-5% imiquimod and photodynamic light therapy despite its favorable side effect profile. Finally, traditional photodynamic light therapy, while painful, appears to be of higher efficacy in comparison to its more tolerable counterpart, daylight phototherapy. "
"Abstract: Multidrug resistance in breast cancer and the associated side-effects of anticancer therapies are significant hurdles in chemotherapy-based treatment. Biodegradable polymeric nano-based targeted drug delivery technologies showed tremendous advantages in targeted local delivery with limited off-targeted side effects. Therefore, there is a persistent need to develop targeted nanomedicine systems for treatment of breast cancer. The current research attempted to develop poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles loaded with raloxifene by modified emulsification solvent diffusion evaporation method to improve oral bioavailability by using Taguchi design. It was observed that the optimized formulation (1:4 drug to polymer ratio) poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) showed a mean particle size and Polydispersity index of 218 ± 23.7 nm and 0.231 ± 0.04, respectively. The entrapment efficiency was found to be 82.30% ± 1.02%. In vitro drug delivery was found to be 92.5% ± 1.48% in 40 h. The nanoparticles were to remain stable at 2°C-8°C even after 30 days. Differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy characterization techniques showed that there was no interaction between the drug and excipient. Stability studies indicate that polymeric nanoparticles were stable at 2°C-8°C after 6 months. Raloxifene nanoparticles may be the most potent targeting moieties to treat highly invasive and metastatic MCF-7 breast cancer cells. "
"Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a systemic autoimmune disease that dramatically affects patients' quality of life. Given the intricacy of RA's pathophysiology, no single treatment can completely halt the disease progression. Here, we attempted to treat RA holistically and synergistically by co-delivering methotrexate (MTX), a standard slow-acting anti-rheumatic drug, and phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a bioactive phytochemical, using a sodium alginate (SA)-pluronic F127 (PF-127)  Abstract: A nanostructured dual-drug loaded smart hydrogel (DD NP HG) was successfully constructed for the intra-articular delivery of MTX and PEITC to the affected joints of RA.The fabrication of the nanoformulation of both MTX (MTX NP) and PEITC (PEITC NE) aided in mitigating the drawbacks and drug-related side effects of the free form of drugs.DD NP HG markedly suppressed joint inflammation and protect against bone destruction in arthritic rats.This combination approach of PEITC and MTX (DD NP HG) synergistically improved anti-arthritic activity and reduced the adverse side effects  "
"PURPOSE: Oxidative stress, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and adenosine signaling are factors associated with psoriatic inflammation. Topical delivery of methotrexate (MTX) has become an option to overcome the side effects caused by systemic therapy in psoriasis, leading to the suppression of NF-κB activation through boosting adenosine release. However, thickened psoriatic skin is the primary restriction against local drug delivery. METHODS: In this study, a ROS responsive MTX prodrug (MTX-TK-HA) was synthesized with the feature of CD44 mediated active targeting to hyperproliferative keratinocytes. MTX prodrug and PLA-mPEG were formulated by nano-precipitation method to develop the MTX-TK-HA/PLA-mPEG nanoassemblies. To achieve painless transdermal delivery, a dissolving microneedle was applied for direct loading of these nanoassemblies by micromolding technique. The particle size, zeta potential, ROS-responsiveness, permeability, and mechanical strength of nanoassemblies and microneedle arrays were determined, respectively. Then, MTT assay, immunoblot analysis, ELISA assay, flow cytometry, and histological staining were utilized to thoroughly evaluate the efficacy of nanoassemblies-loaded microneedles in an imiquimod-induced psoriatic mouse model. RESULTS: Nanoassemblies-loaded microneedle arrays were capable of significantly penetrating imiquimod-induced psoriatic epidermis in mice. The efficient topical delivery of these nanoassemblies was achieved by potent mechanical strength and hyaluronic acid as the dissolvable matrix for microneedle arrays. CD44-mediated endocytosis enabled the intracellular uptake of nanoassemblies in keratinocytes, and methotrexate was released from MTX-TK-HA with ROS stimuli, followed by suppressing the proliferation of epidermal cells via NF-κB pathway blockade. CONCLUSION: In a psoriatic mouse model, nanoassemblies loaded microneedle arrays relieve inflammatory skin disorders via regulation of adenosine and NF-κB signaling. Our study offered a rational design for the transdermal delivery of hydrophobic agents and defined an effective therapeutic option for psoriasis treatment. "
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Bilastine is a second-generation antihistamine approved for the symptomatic treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria. The present trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of a new bilastine 0.6% preservative-free eye drop formulation for the symptomatic treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. METHODS: This phase 3, multicenter, double-masked, randomized study compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of bilastine 0.6% ophthalmic solution with that of ketotifen 0.025% and vehicle. The primary efficacy endpoint was reduction in ocular itching. The Ora-CAC® Allergen Challenge Model was used to assess ocular and nasal symptoms at 15 minutes (onset of action) and 16 hours after treatment. RESULTS: Patients (N=228) were 59.6% male, and the mean (SD) age was 44.1 (13.4) years. Bilastine demonstrated efficacy in reducing ocular itching compared to vehicle at both onset of action and 16 hours after treatment (P<.001). Symptoms improved with ketotifen compared to vehicle 15 minutes after treatment (P<.001). Bilastine demonstrated statistical noninferiority to ketotifen for all 3 post-CAC timepoints at 15 minutes after instillation, based on an inferiority margin of 0.4. Compared with vehicle, bilastine improved in conjunctival redness, ciliary redness, episcleral redness, chemosis, eyelid swelling, tearing, rhinorrhea, ear and palate pruritus, and nasal congestion at 15 minutes after treatment (P<.05). Ophthalmic bilastine was safe and well tolerated. Mean drop comfort scores were significantly better for bilastine than for ketotifen immediately upon instillation (P<.05) and similar to those of vehicle. CONCLUSION: Ophthalmic bilastine effectively reduced ocular itching for 16 hours after administration, suggesting that it could be used as a once-daily treatment for the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.

"BACKGROUND: Benzophenone-3 (BP-3) and its major metabolite benzophenone-1 (BP-1) are widely used as UV filters in sunscreens and cosmetics to prevent sunburn and skin damage, or as stabilizers to prevent photodegradation in many commercial products. As a result, their presence is ubiquitous in the environment, wildlife and humans. Based on endocrine disruption concerns, international regulatory agencies are performing a closer evaluation. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: This work aimed to comprehensively review the available human relevant evidence for safety issues in MEDLINE/PubMed in order to create a structured database of studies, as well as to conduct an integrative analysis as part of the Human Biomonitoring for Europe (HBM4EU) Initiative. RESULTS: A total of 1,635 titles and abstracts were screened and 254 references were evaluated and tabulated in detail, and classified in different categories: i) exposure sources and predictors; ii) human biomonitoring (HBM) exposure levels to perform a meta-analysis; iii) toxicokinetic data in both experimental animals and humans; iv) in vitro and in vivo rodent toxicity studies; and v) human data on effect biomarkers and health outcomes. Our integrative analysis showed that internal peak BP-3 concentrations achieved after a single whole-body application of a commercially available sunscreen (4% w/w) may overlap with concentrations eliciting endocrine disrupting effects in vitro, and with internal concentrations causing in vivo adverse female reproductive effects in rodents that were supported by still limited human data. The adverse effects in rodents included prolonged estrous cycle, altered uterine estrogen receptor gene expression, endometrium hyperplasia and altered proliferation and histology of the mammary gland, while human data indicated menstrual cycle hormonal alterations and increased risk of uterine fibroids and endometriosis. Among the modes of action reported (estrogenic, anti-androgenic, thyroid, etc.), BP-3 and especially BP-1 showed estrogenic activity at human-relevant concentrations, in agreement with the observed alterations in female reproductive endpoints. The meta-analysis of HBM studies identified a higher concern for North Americans, showing urinary BP-3 concentrations on average 10 and 20 times higher than European and Asian populations, respectively. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our work supports that these benzophenones present endocrine disrupting properties, endorsing recent European regulatory efforts to limit human exposure. The reproducible and comprehensive database generated may constitute a point of departure in future risk assessments to support regulatory initiatives. Meanwhile, individuals should not refrain from sunscreen use. Commercially available formulations using inorganic UV filters that are practically not absorbed into systemic circulation may be recommended to susceptible populations. "
"Abstract: Despite specialists' efforts to find the best solutions for cancer diagnosis and therapy, this pathology remains the biggest health threat in the world. Global statistics concerning deaths associated with cancer are alarming; therefore, it is necessary to intensify interdisciplinary research in order to identify efficient strategies for cancer diagnosis and therapy, by using new molecules with optimal therapeutic potential and minimal adverse effects. This review focuses on studies of porphyrin macrocycles with regard to their structural and spectral profiles relevant to their applicability in efficient cancer diagnosis and therapy. Furthermore, we present a critical overview of the main commercial formulations, followed by short descriptions of some strategies approached in the development of third-generation photosensitizers.

"Abstract: Calcipotriol, a vitamin D analogue is widely used in the treatment of psoriasis. However, poor adherence to topical therapy has led to an ineffective use of the medication and built a barrier to the treatment's success. A water-free lipid-based formulation system has been developed to improve dosage and cosmetic properties along with patient compliance. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and cutaneous safety of water-free lipid-based formulations containing calcipotriol (50 &mu;g/g) as compared to their corresponding vehicles and marketed calcipotriol formulations in a psoriasis plaque test. In total, 24 subjects with chronic psoriasis vulgaris were enrolled in this single-center, randomized, vehicle, and comparator-controlled clinical trial and treated once daily over a 12-day period (10 applications). The anti-psoriatic effect was evaluated by sonographic measurement of psoriatic infiltrate and investigators' clinical efficacy assessments. The mean reduction in psoriatic infiltrate from baseline to day 12 (end of trial) with lipid-based calcipotriol formulations (-34% and -37%) was statistically significant (P&lt;0.0001) when compared to their corresponding vehicles (6% and -4%) but not when compared with marketed calcipotriol solution and cream (-34% and -49% respectively). Mean total clinical assessment scores of these lipid-based calcipotriol formulations (1.7 each) were between those of the two comparators - greater than marketed calcipotriol solution (1.3) but lower than cream (2.0). Overall, nine mild non-serious treatment-emergent adverse effects related to all calcipotriol formulations were reported in four subjects, but all recovered at the follow-up visit. Therefore, novel lipid-based formulations of calcipotriol were clearly more efficacious than their corresponding vehicles and considered as safe therapy against psoriasis vulgaris.

"Abstract: Protection against sunburn, skin damage and the carcinogenic effects of ultraviolet light are the primary health benefits associated with UV filters used in topical sunscreen drug products. Countries such as Europe have 30+ UV filters approved for sunscreen products while the US has about 10, greatly reducing the options to provide diverse, effective sun protection products. Bemotrizinol (BEMT) is the first new sunscreen active ingredient to be evaluated for inclusion in the Over-The-Counter (OTC) sunscreen monograph using FDA's new Generally Recognized as Safe and Effective (GRASE) testing guidelines. An in vitro skin permeation test (IVPT) and clinical pilot pharmacokinetic Maximum Usage Trial (MUsT) were completed to support the GRASE determination for 6% BEMT. IVPT results indicated an oil +10% ethanol as the model sunscreen intervention for the pilot MUsT. The open-label trial revealed: BEMT concentrations rarely exceeded FDA's defined threshold (0.5 ng/mL) in plasma; no evidence for BEMT accumulation or steady-state concentrations above threshold; only one moderate and few mild treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Therefore, maximal topical applications of 6% BEMT in a model sunscreen formulation did not contribute to meaningful systemic exposure. These results support the safety of BEMT 6% for human sunscreen use. "
"BACKGROUND: Patients suffering from eczematous dermatitis always required moisturizing cream as a background therapy with the aim to reduce flares and minimize steroids use. The term emollients plus (EP) refers to a topical formulations with vehicle-type substances and additional active, non-medicated substances. We have conducted a study with a topical emollient containing urea 10% and amino-inositole on 20 patients affected from chronic eczematous dermatitis. Primary outcomes were to evaluate effectiveness, in term of Investigator Global Assessment (IGA), and tolerability of EP. Secondary aims included the comparison of NRS (numerical rating scale) itch and NRS-pain, DLQI (Dermatological Life Quality Index) between day one and day 28 and to evaluate the characteristics of EP. METHODS: Subjects were instructed to apply the EP twice daily for 4 weeks on affected skin and use a soft soap while not to put any other topical or systemic product. Statistical analysis was conducted through the test t-Student by comparing IGA, itch-NRS, pain-NRS and DLQI at time 0 and day 28. RESULTS: High statistically significant difference (P=0.0038) between IGA value at T0 and T4 has been demonstrated as for itch and pain (respectively P=0.0203 and P=0.0146). Almost all the patients (89.5%) have declared a good or better tolerability of EP. Two patients did not complete the study. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with chronic eczema could often resolve the dermatitis with the correct choice of emollient without steroids use, especially if it is an EP. "
"Abstract: Lidocaine hydrochloride (LiH), an amide-type local anesthetic agent, is commonly used in dermatological procedures. LiH is categorized as a BCS (biopharmaceutics classification system) class III group, which has high solubility and poor permeability. It should be noted that, in this context, LiH is intended as a local anesthetic, so the level of LiH in systemic circulation should be minimized to avoid toxicity and unwanted side effects such as hypotension and bradycardia. This study aimed to formulate and evaluate LiH-loaded dissolving microneedles (DMNs) with different polymer bases. Moreover, an in vitro permeation study using Franz diffusion cells and in vivo study were also performed. LiH-loaded DMNs were prepared using polymer groups of poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP-K30) and hyaluronic acid (HA). DMNs were created using the micro-molding method with centrifugation. The formulations selected based on the evaluation were F3 (HA 10%) and F5 (PVP-K30 25%). Based on the in vitro permeation study, the amount of drug permeated and deposited in the skin at F3 (HA 10%) was 247.1 ± 41.85 and 98.35 ± 12.86 μg, respectively. On the other hand, the amount of drug permeated and deposited in the skin at F5 (PVP-K30 25%) was 277.7 ± 55.88 and 59.46 ± 9.25 μg, respectively. Our in vivo drug-permeation study showed that only one rat from the PVP-K30 polymer group-with a concentration of 150.32 ng/mL-was detected on rat plasma. Therefore, LiH can be formulated into a DMN and can be deposited in the skin with a safe concentration of the drug permeating into systemic circulation. "
"Abstract: Androgenic alopecia (AGA) is a genetically predetermined condition that occurs as a result of stepwise miniaturization of the dermal papilla. During this process, the hair follicle suffers from increasing malnutrition and eventually dies, causing progressive hair loss. We recently highlighted that HIF-1α modulation may counteract hair loss. Here, we aim to demonstrate the positive influence of Tomorrowlabs HIF strengthening factor [HSF] hair restoration technology on hair biology in a monocentric blinded clinical trial over a total period of 9 months. A trial with 20 subjects (4 female and 16 male) and once-daily application of [HSF] hair restoration technology to the scalp was conducted. To assess the tolerability and efficacy of [HSF], testing included dermatological assessment, determination of hair loss by counting after combing, macro images of the head and TrichoScan evaluation of hair density as well as the proportion of anagen hair versus telogen hair. The clinical data show Tomorrowlabs [HSF] hair restoration to be safe and effective to counteract AGA. The use of Tomorrowlabs [HSF] hair restoration resulted in improvements in the clinical parameters of hair quality such as thickness (+7.2%), hair density (+14.3%) and shine and elasticity (+20.3%) during the test period. The effectiveness of the test product was further determined by a significant reduction in hair loss of an average of 66.8% in treatment-responsive subjects after 6 months and an increase in hair growth reaching up to 32.5%, with an average percentage change of 8.4% in all participants and 10.8% in the responsive patients (85% of the study cohort) after 9 months on TrichoScan evaluation. The hair growth cycle was harmonized with the result of an average anagen hair percentage increase of +8.0% and telogen hair percentage reduction of -14.0% shown in the test area. Applicable for both sexes in an alcohol-free formulation, beneficial to scalp health and free of complications or side effects, this novel product provides objectively measurable results counteracting hair loss paired with an improved look and feel of the hair.

"Abstract: Temoporfin (mTHPC) is approved in Europe for the photodynamic treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Although it has a promising profile, its lipophilic character hampers the full exploitation of its potential due to high tendency of aggregation and a reduced ROS generation that compromise photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy. Moreover, for its clinical administration, mTHPC requires the presence of ethanol and propylene glycol as solvents, often causing adverse effects in the site of injection. In this paper we explored the efficiency of a new mTHPC formulation that uses human serum albumin (HSA) to disperse the photosensitizer in solution (mTHPC@HSA), investigating its anticancer potential in two HNSCC cell lines. Through a comprehensive characterization, we demonstrated that mTHPC@HSA is stable in physiological environment, does not aggregate, and is extremely efficient in PDT performance, due to its high singlet oxygen generation and the high dispersion as monomolecular form in HSA. This is supported by the computational identification of the specific binding pocket of mTHPC in HSA. Moreover, mTHPC@HSA-PDT induces cytotoxicity in both HNSCC cell lines, increasing intracellular ROS generation and the number of γ-H2AX foci, a cellular event involved in the global response to cellular stress. Taken together these results highlight the promising phototoxic profile of the complex, prompting further studies to assess its clinical potential. "
"BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease with a multifactorial genesis. Structural changes are encountered in psoriasis and skin barrier function is impaired. Tight junctions (TJs) play a key role in skin barrier dysfunction. Loss of profilaggrin or filaggrin leads to changes in the stratum corneum and consequent loss of water and the development of xerosis. METHODS: We carried out an observational study to evaluate the efficacy, skin acceptability and cosmetic qualities of a cream formulation, based on 40% urea and amino-inositol, in the treatment of mild psoriasis in the absence of other associated cosmetic/pharmacological treatments. All parameters were evaluated before (T0) and after 4 weeks (T4). Efficacy assessment was based on both clinical evaluation and photographic documentation. RESULTS: The results showed significant clinical improvement (-64.18% PASI, -57.11% BSA, -61.84% Plaque Score, -41.86% PGA and -76.34% VAS -77.5 DLQI) in 4 weeks of treatment. No significant side effects were reported. Similarly, the degree of satisfaction with the product and adherence to its use were particularly satisfactory among patients. CONCLUSIONS: The tested product was found to be a promising, effective adjuvant treatment in patients with mild psoriasis, and was also useful in reducing itchy symptoms, the impact on quality of life, as well as significantly reducing the clinical signs of psoriasis.

"Abstract: Herbicides are widely used in modern agricultural production for their advantages of high efficiency, convenience, and speed. However, there have been many problems caused by herbicide formulations, such as volatilization, leaching, and rain-washing loss in the process of agricultural application. Self-assembled nanotechnology is a promising strategy to solve these existing problems due to the environmentally friendly preparation process and high delivery efficiency. In this study, the stable fluorescent nanoparticles (AP NPs) based on co-assembly of acifluorfen (ACI) and poly(salicylic acid) (PSA) are constructed by using non-covalent bond interactions. The results indicate that the obtained nanoparticles with a stable fluorescence characteristic show improved physiochemical properties, such as uniform morphology, good thermal stability, low surface tension, and high retention on plants. The co-assembly can produce singlet oxygen to enhance the herbicidal activity under irradiation of light and reduce the leaching property of ACI to minimize the adverse impact on the aquatic environment. The safety evaluation of soybean seedlings indicates that AP NPs have no damage to non-target plants. In summary, the co-assembled herbicidal nano-formulation composed of ACI and PSA has high bioactivity and low environmental risks, which can be widely used in agricultural production. "
"Abstract: Topical tretinoin has historically been limited by poor tolerability and molecular instability. Research advances have enhanced its efficacy and tolerability, along with reducing oxidation and photodegradation. By overcoming historical limitations, tretinoin use can be extended to patient populations and clinical situations previously not suitable. This review discusses historical limitations of tretinoin, methods employed to overcome those limitations, use within clinical practice, and new formulations of tretinoin for the treatment of acne.

"Abstract: Chemoradiotherapy with controlled-release nanocarriers such as sono-sensitive nanodroplets (NDs) can enhance the anticancer activity of chemotherapy medicines and reduces normal tissue side effects. In this study, folic acid-functionalized methotrexate-loaded perfluorohexane NDs with alginate shell (FA-MTX/PFH@alginate NDs) were synthesized, characterized, and their potential for ultrasound-guided chemoradiotherapy of breast cancer was investigated in vitro and in vivo. The cancer cell (4T1) viabilities and surviving fractions after NDs and ultrasound treatments were significantly decreased. However, this reduction was much more significant for ultrasound in combination with X-ray irradiation. The in vitro and in vivo results confirmed that MTX-loaded NDs are highly biocompatible and they have no significant hemolytic activity and organ toxicity. Furthermore, the in vivo results indicated that the FA-MTX/PFH@alginate NDs were accumulated selectively in the tumor region. In conclusion, FA-functionalized MTX/PFH@alginate NDs have a great theranostic performance for ultrasound-controlled drug delivery in combination with radiotherapy of breast cancer. "
"BACKGROUND: Diclofenac diethylamine (DDEA) gel has demonstrated efficacy for treatment of ankle sprains in both the 1.16% four-times-daily (QID) and 2.32% twice-daily (BID) formulations. The objective of this study was to compare, for the first time, the efficacy of DDEA 2.32% gel BID and DDEA 1.16% gel QID. METHODS: This was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, active-controlled, parallel-group study conducted in China from October 2019 to November 2020, designed to determine the noninferiority of DDEA 2.32% gel BID relative to DDEA 1.16% gel QID for treatment of grade I-II ankle sprain. At study entry, patients must have had pain on movement (POM) ≥50 mm on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS), and not received any pain medication. The primary efficacy endpoint was the noninferiority of DDEA 2.32% gel BID vs DDEA 1.16% gel QID for POM as assessed by the patient using the 100-mm VAS, conducted on day 5. Secondary endpoints included measures of ankle tenderness, joint function, swelling, and patient-reported pain intensity and pain relief. RESULTS: A total of 302 patients were randomized and 95.4% completed the study. The mean (SD) change in POM from baseline to day 5 using the 100-mm VAS was - 42.8 mm (19.7 mm) with DDEA 2.32% gel BID and - 43.1 mm (18.1 mm) with DDEA 1.16% gel QID for the per-protocol population. The least squares mean difference (DDEA gel 2.32% - DDEA gel 1.16%) at this timepoint was 1.11 mm (95% CI - 3.00, 5.22; P = 0.595), and the upper limit (5.22 mm) of the 95% CI was less than the noninferiority margin of 13 mm, demonstrating that DDEA 2.32% gel BID was noninferior to DDEA 1.16% gel QID. Similar trends were seen for the secondary efficacy endpoints. There was no significant difference in the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events or adverse events adjudicated as being treatment related. All treatment-related adverse events were dermatological; one patient discontinued from the DDEA 2.32% gel BID arm due to application-site inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: DDEA 2.32% gel BID offers a convenient alternative to DDEA 1.16% gel QID, with similar pain reduction and relief, anti-inflammatory effects, and tolerability. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04052620. "

"Abstract: Methotrexate (MTX) is a conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug, which is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. However, insufficient responses to oral MTX at lower doses as well as increased variation of drug bioavailability and a deteriorated safety profile during dose escalation are regularly observed in patients. Some of its main side effects may be overcome by temporary drug hiatus or dose reduction or can be counterbalanced with folic acid. Especially gastrointestinal side effects are a major reason for permanent treatment discontinuation. Recent data suggest that MTX in a subcutaneous injection formulation can reduce gastrointestinal effects and thus may allow us to overcome oral intolerance and improve drug survival. Here, we review the currently available literature on the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous MTX in comparison to oral MTX in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Despite some inconsistency between data, an improvement in the efficacy and/or safety profile of subcutaneous MTX has been demonstrated. In the USA, subcutaneous MTX is an established second-line treatment already, while in European countries this formulation is even recommended as a first-line treatment. With the recent approval of subcutaneous MTX in Japan, another beneficial treatment option is now available for Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis. "
"Abstract: The inclusion of nanoparticles can increase the quality of certain products. One application is the inclusion of Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles in a glass coating matrix to produce a UV-absorbing coating for glass sheets. Yet, the question is whether the inclusion of ZnO in the matrix induces toxicity at low exposure levels. To test this, mice were given single intratracheal instillation of 1) ZnO powder (ZnO), 2) ZnO in a glass matrix coating in its liquid phase (ZnO-Matrix), and 3) the matrix with no ZnO (Matrix). Doses of ZnO were 0.23, 0.67, and 2 µg ZnO/mouse. ZnO Matrix doses had equal amounts of ZnO, while Matrix was adjusted to have an equal volume of matrix as ZnO Matrix. Post-exposure periods were 1, 3, or 28 d. Endpoints were pulmonary inflammation as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid cellularity, genotoxicity in lung and liver, measured by comet assay, histopathology of lung and liver, and global gene expression in lung using microarrays. Neutrophil numbers were increased to a similar extent with ZnO and ZnO-Matrix at 1 and 3 d. Only weak genotoxicity without dose-response effects was observed in the lung. Lung histology showed an earlier onset of inflammation in material-exposed groups as compared to controls. Microarray analysis showed a stronger response in terms of the number of differentially regulated genes in ZnO-Matrix exposed mice as compared to Matrix only. Activated canonical pathways included inflammatory and cardiovascular ones. In conclusion, the pulmonary toxicity of ZnO was not changed by formulation in a liquid matrix for glass coating. "
"Abstract: Topical therapies, in many cases over-the-counter (OTC) formulations, are available for the treatment of acne, including benzoyl peroxide (BPO), salicylic acid, and retinoids. While these agents provide therapeutic efficacy, combination regimens can offer improved outcomes due to their ability to address multiple pathways involved in acne formation, making them better suited to address the multiple factors involved in acne pathogenesis and the breadth of complexion issues associated with the condition. The present study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of a daily regimen comprised of topical low-dose (2.5%) BPO applied in the morning and topical retinol applied in the evening in 33 subjects with mild to moderate acne who completed the study. A significant reduction in global total acne count from baseline to week 12 (primary endpoint) was achieved, in addition to significant improvements in Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of acne severity and reductions in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions. Treatment also significantly improved acne-complexion graded efficacy parameters (tactile surface roughness, uneven skin tone, skin blotchiness, and lack of skin clarity), and was well-tolerated, with no statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) increases in objective or subjective facial irritation. Significant improvements from baseline to week 12 were observed for both self-assessment of facial skin conditions and quality of life (QoL) scores. No product-related adverse events (AEs) were observed in the study subjects. J Drugs Dermatol. 2022;21(12):1340-1346. doi:10.36849/JDD.6845. "
"Abstract: Photoprotection is a critical health prevention strategy to reduce the deleterious effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and visible light (VL). Methods of photoprotection are reviewed in this paper, with an emphasis on sunscreen. The most appropriate sunscreen formulation for personal use depends on several factors. Active sunscreen ingredients vary in their protective effect over the UVR and VL spectrum. There are dermatologic diseases that cause photosensitivity or that are aggravated by a particular action spectrum. In these situations, sunscreen suggestions can address the specific concern. Sunscreen does not represent a single entity. Appropriate personalized sunscreen selection is critical to improve compliance and clinical outcomes. Health care providers can facilitate informed product selection with awareness of evolving sunscreen formulations and counseling patients on appropriate use. This review aims to summarize different forms of photoprotection, discuss absorption of sunscreen ingredients, possible adverse effects, and disease-specific preferences for chemical, physical or oral agents that may decrease UVR and VL harmful effects.

"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Eugenia gracillima is widely used by the population in the manufacture of pulps and jellies, with popular reports of its use in the treatment of infections in the urinary system, respiratory and dermatological problems. A previous study reports that EO from E. gracillima leaves proved to be a promising antioxidant agent in combating the promastigote forms of protozoa. Despite this, this species has been little studied due to its pharmacological properties. STUDY OBJECTIVE: In this study, an essential oil extracted (EO) from Eugenia gracillima leaves was evaluated for its acute toxicity and anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive and behavioral effects in mice. METHODS: The EO was obtained by hydrodistillation, and the composition analysis was performed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Acute toxicity assessment was performed with observation of hematological parameters and histopathological evaluation, as well as tests to investigate antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory activities and behavioral effects. RESULTS: Chromatographic analysis showed D-germacrene (16.10%), γ-muurolene-g (15.60%) and bicyclogermacrene (8.53%) as the majority of compounds. In the toxicity evaluation, no death or physiological changes were observed in mice treated with a single oral dose of up to 5000 mg/kg, and it did not lyse erythrocytes in vitro. The hematological parameters evaluated were not changed after treatment; however, 5,000 mg/kg promoted an increase in transaminase levels. In the histopathological evaluation, only the animals that received the dose of 5000 mg/kg showed discrete leukocyte infiltration around the centrilobular vein in the liver. Antinociceptive activity was detected through tests of acetic acid-induced writhing, formalin, and tail flick, promoted in part by the opioid receptor pathway. In the evaluation of anti-inflammatory activity, a reduction in inflammation was observed in the paw edema test and a decrease in the migration of leukocytes and neutrophils in the peritonitis test. The open field and elevated plus maze tests showed that EO did not affect the animals' motor functions or exploratory activity. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that the essential oil of E. gracillima has potential for the development of pharmaceutical formulations with analgesic and anti-inflammatory actions in non-toxic concentrations.

"Abstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory, demyelinating and neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system. Disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) and subsequent adherence are crucial for preventing reversible episodes of neurological dysfunction and delayed onset of progressive accumulation of irreversible deficits. Yet, side effects may limit their usage in clinical practice. Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects are a significant limitation of the use of dimethyl fumarate (DMF), the most frequently prescribed oral DMD in MS worldwide. Diroximel fumarate (DRF) is a second-generation oral fumaric acid ester (FAE) that was developed as a formulation with better GI tolerability. The improved tolerability is assumed to be related to a lower synthesis of gut-irritating methanol. Other explanations for DRF's lower extent of GI irritation include a more modest off-target activity due to its chemical structure. The superior GI tolerability of DRF compared to DMF could be proven in clinical trials and lead to approval of DRF for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS/relapsing-remitting MS (United States Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, respectively). Here, we summarize the mode of action of oral FAE and compare the chemical and physiological characteristics of DMF and DRF. Moreover, we discuss the adverse effects of FAE and introduce the emerging preclinical and trial data leading to the approval of DRF in MS. This article additionally reviews our current understanding of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the efficacy of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination in people treated with FAE.

"BACKGROUND: Various products are available for lightening hair. There are no data on which applications are actually used in hairdressing, impeding proper estimation of actual exposure and necessary preventive measures. OBJECTIVES: To assess information about availability, usage and formulation of lightening preparations in the German hairdressing trade. METHODS: A market survey was conducted and hairdressers were surveyed by online questionnaires. RESULTS: Of 783 hairdressers clicking the link, 565 hairdressers (91.2% female, mean age of 40.2 ± 11.7 years) from all German states responded (response rate: 72.2%). The questionnaire survey has shown that available hair-lightening preparations in the German hairdressing trade are (multiple selection possible): dust-free (88.5%) and non-dust-free bleaching powders (22.1%), bleaching creams (41.9%), high-lifting hair colour creams (88.8%) and normal hair colour creams (58.4%). Five hundred eighteen (91.7%) hairdressers favour lightening hair with powder. The market survey revealed that bleaching powders and creams contain potassium persulfate, ammonium persulfate and sodium persulfate or combinations of these persulfate salts. CONCLUSIONS: Hairdressers are exposed to various hair-lightening applications containing different chemicals. Preventive measures need to address adverse skin and respiratory effects. Implementation of targeted health education already in early career stages (i.e., apprenticeship) seems advisable and can be maintained by refresher trainings. "
"Abstract: Inflammatory diseases are the focus of several clinical studies, due to limitations and serious side effects of available therapies. Plant-based drugs (e.g., salicylic acid, morphine) have become landmarks in the pharmaceutical field. Therefore, we investigated the immunomodulatory effects of flowers, leaves, and roots from  "
"BACKGROUND: A cosmeceutical topical formulation containing a non-hormonal estrogen receptor activator, Methyl Estradiolpropanoate (MEP), has been developed to address periorbital skin aging in post-menopausal women with estrogen-deficient skin (EDS). OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of Emepelle Eye Cream&reg; (Biopelle, Ferndale Pharma Group, Ferndale, MI, USA) for the rejuvenation of the periorbital skin areas in women EDS. The secondary objectives were to assess the tolerability and satisfaction with Emepelle Eye Cream as assessed by the clinical investigator and the participants. METHODS: Clinical improvement (ie, change from baseline visit) to the end of study topical application in the periorbital areas were assessed by the clinical investigator using the clinician-rated quality of periorbital skin area visual scoring scale and by the participant using the participant&rsquo;s self-evaluation of the quality of periorbital skin area questionnaire. Secondary objectives and endpoints were assessed using a subject Quality of Life (QoL) evaluation, a clinician- and a participant-evaluation of tolerability and side effects, and the C-GAIS and P-GAIS questionnaires. Baseline scores were compared to scores at the follow-up visits. RESULTS: Clinician evaluations included a Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) rating of periorbital skin areas using a 6-point rating scale as well as tolerability and side effects. The averaged clinical GAIS improvement for all subjects who completed the study improved by 21%. The mean clinician GAIS score at study completion was 2.7, and 26 of the 31 subjects who completed the study showed improvement. A clinician GAIS score of 1 (very much improved) was observed in 3 study subjects. The averaged subject improvement results included improvements in each category at the primary endpoint. The subjects reported that their satisfaction with their periorbital appearance improved by 47% as compared to before treatment. The product was well tolerated by all subjects and no significant side effects were reported. CONCLUSION: In an open label study of 31 female subjects who had been amenorrheic for at least one year, topical application of Emepelle Eye Cream for periorbital skin rejuvenation was effective and well-tolerated.

"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Artiri La Li Honey Pill (ALLHP) is a traditional medicinal formula that is widely used in Xinjiang, China, for the treatment of vitiligo. Since the cause of vitiligo has not been determined, no satisfactory treatment is available. Clinical interventions include pharmacological treatment with psoralen, usually in conjunction with ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation, but toxic side effects limit this application. Studies on the activity and mechanisms of ALLHP are scarce. AIM OF THE STUDY: To verify the therapeutic effect of ALLHP on vitiligo and determine its effectiveness as a theoretical and experimental basis for the development of innovative drugs with independent intellectual property rights and the effective use of local resources. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The experimental animal model of vitiligo was established by chemical decoloring. Rats were treated with gradient doses of ALLHP. The therapeutic effect was judged by gross observation. The contents of TYR, MAO, AchE and MDA in serum and skin tissue, the number of hair follicles containing melanin in skin tissue, the distribution of epidermal melanin, and the weight index of immune organs were detected, and the therapeutic effect of ALLHP on vitiligo was evaluated. In addition, certain monomer components in ALLHP were used to intervene in the zebrafish juvenile melanin suppression model, and the melanin-activating activities of some monomer components in ALLHP were screened by counting the melanin area ratio. RESULTS: ALLHP increased the number of melanin-containing hair follicles and the epidermal melanin content in the skin of experimental vitiligo animals, repaired the skin cell morphology to a certain extent, increased the content of TYR in serum and skin, and reduced the content of MDA, AchE and MAO. Carvone, Luteolin, Psoralen and Psoraleae phenol and Bakuchiol could increase the melanin area of experimental melanin inhibition in zebrafish. CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, ALLHP can increase the number of melanin-containing hair follicles and the epidermal melanin content in the skin of vitiligo animals and restore skin cell morphology to a certain extent by reducing oxidative stress in epidermal tissue. A wide range of active ingredients may promote melanogenesis with ALLHP. "
"PURPOSE: Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is emerging as a cancer treatment alternative with significant advantages over conventional therapies, including its minimally invasive and site-specific nature, its radical antitumour efficacy with minimal side effects, and its capacity to raise an antitumour immune response. The study explores the efficacy of SDT in combination with nanotechnology against pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: A nanoparticulate formulation (HPNP) based on a cathepsin B-degradable glutamate-tyrosine co-polymer that carries hematoporphyrin was used in this study for the SDT-based treatment of PDAC. Cathepsin B levels in BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cells were correlated to cellular uptake of HPNP. The HPNP efficiency to induce a sonodynamic effect at varying ultrasound parameters, and at different oxygenation and pH conditions, was investigated. The biodistribution, tumour accumulation profile, and antitumour efficacy of HPNP in SDT were examined in immunocompetent mice carrying bilateral ectopic murine pancreatic tumours. The immune response profile of excised tumour tissues was also examined. RESULTS: The HPNP formulation significantly improved cellular uptake of hematoporphyrin for both BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cells, while increase of cellular uptake was positively correlated in PANC-1 cells. There was a clear SDT-induced cytotoxicity at the ultrasound conditions tested, and the treatment impaired the capacity of both BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cells to form colonies. The overall acoustic energy and pulse length, rather than the power density, were key in eliciting the effects observed in vitro. The SDT treatment in combination with HPNP resulted in 21% and 27% reduction of the target and off-target tumour volumes, respectively, within 24 h. A single SDT treatment elicited an antitumour effect that was characterized by an SDT-induced decrease in immunosuppressive T cell phenotypes. CONCLUSION: SDT has significant potential to serve as a monotherapy or adjunctive treatment for inoperable or borderline resectable PDAC. "
"Abstract: Calcium phosphates (CaPs) have been recently proposed as a bio- and eco-compatible alternative to UV filters in sunscreens, which are in the spotlight for being associated with health risks for both people and the environment. Here, natural CaPs extracted from fish bones have been tested as a booster of the sun protection factor (SPF), that is, as material working in synergy with UV filters to increase sunscreen UV-shielding efficiency, in combination with three of the most used UV filters, namely, octocrylene (OCR), octinoxate, and padimate-O, at different concentrations (10.0 and 20.0 wt %). The material obtained by calcination at 800 °C (CaP-N) was also enriched with Zn (CaP-Zn) or Mn (CaP-Mn) in an attempt to increase its SPF-boosting abilities. CaP-N and CaP-Zn consisted of a biphasic mixture of hydroxyapatite and beta tricalcium phosphate, while CaP-Mn presented a small quantity of Mn oxides. CaP-N was the most effective at increasing the SPF of the final emulsions, doubling the SPF of the formulation containing 20.0 wt % of OCR from 40.6 to 80.8. The results show that these CaPs, produced according to a circular economy approach, can be used as effective SPF boosters to decrease the concentration of UV filters used in sunscreen, while retaining high SPF values.

"Abstract: Benzophenone-3 (BP3) is an organic UV filter widely used in the commercial formulations of various personal care products. It has been detected ubiquitously in the environment and human tissues. Recently, BP3-induced neurotoxicity has been identified as the main health risk to humans and aquatic organisms. However, most research has been focused on embryonic development, and few studies explore chronic lifetime exposure. In the present study, we evaluated the neurotoxicity of lifetime exposure to an environmentally relevant concentration of BP3 in zebrafish. Our findings revealed that continuous BP3 exposure at 10 μg/L (0.04 μM) from 6 h post fertilization (hpf) to adulthood at 5 months led to female-biased social behavioral deficits and learning and memory impairment. These neurobehavioral effects were characterized by decreased prosocial activities in the social preference test and mirror biting assay, and reduced learning and memory in a T-maze test. Furthermore, these effects were accompanied by female-specific decreases in brain weight and brain dopamine concentration, female-biased decrease of neurogenesis in the telencephalon as well as female-specific increases in apoptotic cells and expression levels of genes and proteins related to the apoptosis pathway in the brain. Our results suggest that BP3-induced social behavior and learning/memory deficits are correlated to the cell loss in the telencephalon region of the zebrafish brain. "
"Abstract: The principal actors in acne are the sebaceous gland, keratinocytes of the follicle and skin microbiome/innate immunity. Current acne treatments are frequently accompanied by side effects or may cause antibacterial resistance. New formulations and emerging treatments with novel mechanisms of action and improved formulations have recently been made available or are currently under development. This review provides an update on the most recent advances in topical or systemic acne therapy related to recent data on the pathophysiology of acne. A review of the most recent literature about new and emerging acne treatments since 2016 listed in the PubMed and Clinicaltrials.gov database was performed by a group of dermatologists interested in acne (GEA). Several novel treatments have been made available or are currently under development, including Clascosterone, Trifarotene and Sarecy-cline, as well as more effective and better tolerated formulations of existing compounds, such as Minocycline, Tretinoin, Tazarotene and Lidose-isotretinoin, and emerging acne therapies (including hyaluronic acid, cannabidiol, modulators of the skin microbiota, insulin-like growth factor, vaccines, bacteriophages, probiotics and antimicrobial peptides), targeting the sebaceous gland and its activity, inflammation or keratinocytes of the follicle and skin microbiome including Cutibacterium acnes. Recently, in addition to other fixed combinations, a fixed combination of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide that targets acne scars has been made available for the first time. The newly available products and other potentially emerging treatment options will increase the armamentarium of acne therapies and potentially reduce its prevalence worldwide. "
"Abstract: Cyclosporine A (CsA) is a selective and reversible immunosuppressant agent that is widely used as a medication for a wide spectrum of diseases in humans such as graft versus host disease, non-infectious uveitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis. Furthermore, the CsA is used to treat keratoconjunctivitis sicca, chronic superficial keratitis, immune-mediated keratitis and equine recurrent uveitis in animals. The selective activity of Cyclosporine A (CsA) was demonstrated to be an immunomodulation characteristic of T-lymphocyte proliferation and inhibits cytokine gene expression. Moreover, the lipophilic characteristics with poor bioavailability and low solubility in water, besides the side effects, force the need to develop new formulations and devices that will provide adequate penetration into the anterior and posterior segments of the eye. This review aims to summarize the effectiveness and safety of cyclosporine A delivery platforms in veterinary ophthalmology. "
"BACKGROUND: Dry eye disease (DED), arising from various etiologic factors, leads to tear film instability, ocular surface damage, and neurosensory changes. DED causes symptoms such as ocular dryness, burning, itching, pain, and visual impairment. Given their well-established anti-inflammatory effects, topical steroid preparations have been widely used as a short-term treatment option for DED. Because of potential risks of ocular hypertension, cataracts, and infections associated with the long-term use of topical steroids, published trials comparing the efficacy and safety of topical steroids (versus placebo) have mostly been of short duration (three to eight weeks). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of topical corticosteroids compared with no treatment, placebo, other steroidal or non-steroidal therapies, or a combination of therapies for DED. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2021, Issue 8); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), without restriction on language or year of publication. The date of the last search was 20 August 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which topical corticosteroids, alone or in combination with tobramycin, were compared with no treatment, artificial tears (AT), vehicles, AT plus tobramycin, or cyclosporine A (CsA). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We applied standard Cochrane methodology. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 22 RCTs conducted in the USA, Italy, Spain, China, South Korea, and India. These RCTs reported outcome data from a total of 4169 participants with DED.  Study characteristics and risk of bias All trials recruited adults aged 18 years or older, except one trial that enrolled children and adolescents aged between 3 and 14 years. Half of these trials involved predominantly female participants (median 79%, interquartile range [IQR] 76% to 80%). On average, each trial enrolled 86 participants (IQR 40 to 158). The treatment duration of topical steroids ranged between one week and three months; trial duration lasted between one week and six months. Eight trials were sponsored exclusively by industry, and four trials were co-sponsored by industry and institutional or governmental funds. We assessed the risk of bias of both subjective and objective outcomes using RoB 2, finding nearly half of the trials to be at high risk of bias associated with selective outcome reporting. Findings Of the 22 trials, 16 evaluated effects of topical steroids, alone or in combination with tobramycin, as compared with lubricants (AT, vehicle), AT plus tobramycin, or no treatment. Corticosteroids probably have a small to moderate effect on improving patient-reported symptoms by 0.29 standardized mean difference (SMD) (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.16 to 0.42) as compared with lubricants (moderate certainty evidence). Topical steroids also likely have a small to moderate effect on lowering corneal staining scores by 0.4 SMDs (95% CI 0.18 to 0.62) (moderate certainty evidence). However, steroids may increase tear film break-up time (TBUT) slightly (mean difference [MD] 0.70 s, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.34; low certainty evidence) but not tear osmolarity (MD 1.60 mOsm/kg, 95% CI -10.47 to 13.67; very low certainty evidence).  Six trials examined topical steroids, either alone or in combination with CsA, against CsA alone. Low certainty evidence indicates that steroid-based interventions may have a small to moderate effect on improving participants' symptoms (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.15), but little to no effect on corneal staining scores (SMD 0.05, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.35) as compared with CsA. The effect of topical steroids compared to CsA alone on TBUT (MD 0.37 s, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.87) or tear osmolarity (MD 5.80 mOsm/kg, 95% CI -0.94 to 12.54; loteprednol etabonate alone) is uncertain because the certainty of the evidence is low or very low. None of the included trials reported on quality of life scores. Adverse effects The evidence for adverse ocular effects of topical corticosteroids is very uncertain. Topical corticosteroids may increase participants' risk of intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation (risk ratio [RR] 5.96, 95% CI 1.30 to 27.38) as compared with lubricants. However, when compared with CsA, steroids alone or combined with CsA may decrease or increase IOP elevation (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 8.33). It is also uncertain whether topical steroids may increase risk of cataract formation when compared with lubricants (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.22), given the short-term use and study duration (four weeks or less) to observe longer-term adverse effects.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the evidence for the specified review outcomes was of moderate to very low certainty, mostly due to high risk of bias associated with selective results reporting. For dry eye patients whose symptoms require anti-inflammatory control, topical corticosteroids probably provide small to moderate degrees of symptom relief beyond lubricants, and may provide small to moderate degrees of symptom relief beyond CsA. However, the current evidence is less certain about the effects of steroids on improved tear film quality or quantity. The available evidence is also very uncertain regarding the adverse effects of topical corticosteroids on IOP elevation or cataract formation or progression. Future trials should generate high certainty evidence to inform physicians and patients of the optimal treatment strategies with topical corticosteroids in terms of regimen (types, formulations, dosages), duration, and its time-dependent adverse profile.

"Abstract: A small library of new angelicin derivatives was designed and synthesized with the aim of bypassing the side effects of trimethylangelicin (TMA), a promising agent for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. To prevent photoreactions with DNA, hindered substituents were inserted at the 4 and/or 6 positions. Unlike the parent TMA, none of the new derivatives exhibited significant cytotoxicity or mutagenic effects. Among the synthesized compounds, the 4-phenylderivative  "
"Abstract: Although having undergone decades of development, nanoparticulate drug delivery vehicles for efficient cancer therapy remain a challenge, confined by low drug loading, instability, and poor cancer tissue selectivity. A self-assembled prodrug, the combination of prodrug strategy and the self-assembly merits, represents a special chemical entity which spontaneously organizes into supramolecular composites with defined architecture, therefore also providing a strategy to develop new medications. Paclitaxel (PTX) is still among the most generally prescribed chemotherapeutics in oncology but is restricted by poor solubility. Although photodynamic therapy, with its noninvasive features and barely developed drug resistance, signifies an alternative tool to suppress life-threatening cancer, sole use hardly fulfills its potential. To this end, a reduction-activatable heterotetrameric prodrug with the photosensitizer is synthesized, then formulated into self-assembled nanoparticles (NPs) for tumor imaging and combined chemo- and photodynamic therapy. Coating the NPs with amphiphilic polymer distearylphosphatidylethanolamine-polyethylene glycol-arginine-glycine-aspartate (DSPE-PEG-RGD) offers high stability and enables cancer tissue targeting. The as-prepared NPs enlighten disease cells and reveal more potent cytotoxicity comparing to PTX and the photosensitizer alone. Furthermore, the NPs selectively accumulates into tumors and synergistically inhibits tumor proliferation with reduced side effects in mice. "
"BACKGROUND: Cosmetic procedures with lasers, nonenergy devices, and injectables are increasing in popularity among patients with skin of color. Published algorithms address measures to reduce side effects related to aesthetic procedures; however, none focus on reducing adverse events in skin of color. METHODS: An expert panel of dermatologists and plastic surgeons conducted face-to-face and online meetings to develop an algorithm for measures before, during, and after using aesthetic devices (energy and nonenergy-based) and injectable treatments based on the best available evidence for skin of color. Published algorithms and literature searches for aesthetic procedures provided guidance for the current algorithm. A modified Delphi method was used to reach a consensus to apply outcomes of literature searches, along with expert opinion, resulting in the current algorithm. RESULTS: The four sections of the algorithm outline an approach to optimize outcomes with specific before, during, and after procedure considerations. Pre-procedural consultation includes the development of a specific treatment plan based on individual patient goals and risk profile (including history and signs that may predict a higher risk for pigmentary or scarring complications). Before the procedure, sun avoidance and sunscreen use are emphasized; herpes simplex virus 1 prophylaxis and bleaching agents are administered if indicated. During the procedure, skin cleansing products are addressed, along with judicious techniques to minimize unintended cutaneous injury or inflammation. Post-procedural sunscreen and gentle skincare that may include skin-lightening agents or formulations designed to prevent infection and promote optimum healing are advised. CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm strives to optimize treatment outcomes for patients with skin of color by providing their physicians with guidance on measures before, during, and after office-based medical aesthetic procedures.

"BACKGROUND: The topical use of vitamin C has been explored for many decades due to its antioxidant potential, whitening action, and the essential role it plays in the synthesis and maintenance of collagen. As Ascorbic Acid (AA) is unstable, derivative molecules and stabilization strategies have been explored to facilitate its incorporation into dermatological products. Even though these molecules are already for sale, there is still a shortage of scientific data regarding efficacy studies of these assets, especially in vivo. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review was to investigate and discuss issues regarding the topical application of vitamin C and its most common derivatives, including the difficulties, biases, and prospects for future clinical studies to better elucidate its effects. METHODS: A literature review was carried out to select studies that evaluated the topical use of ascorbic acid and/or its derivatives. The studies which are ""fully available"", ""in vivo"" and ""in vitro"", were used as inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Due to the instability of Ascorbic Acid, it is essential to study derivative molecules that maintain or even improve their effectiveness in dermatological products. Despite this, the studies of these derivatives presented in the scientific literature are mostly in vitro. In recent years, it has been possible to observe an increase in in vivo efficacy tests, and this trend is expected to continue in the future. However, they present very different approaches and issues. CONCLUSION: Studies of stability, safety, adverse reactions, and especially in vivo efficacy studies with a relevant number of subjects and standardized parameters are essential for better elucidating the effects of the topical application of vitamin C derivatives in comparison to ascorbic acid formulations for the skin.

"Abstract: None Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease of the joints with no cure and treatment modalities only focus on reducing the symptoms. Methotrexate (MTX) is a primary drug used for its treatment but is associated with severe toxicity. The study aimed to use solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) as carriers for MTX to achieve improved efficacy in RA treatment at reduced doses, thus decreasing the potential toxicity of the drug, making SLNs suitable and safe drug carriers. MTX-loaded SLNs (MTX-SLNs) were formulated and coated with hyaluronic acid (HA; HA-MTX-SLNs) and were evaluated for their efficacy in a complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritic rat model. Both MTX-SLNs and HA-MTX-SLNs demonstrated a significant reduction in toxicity and enhanced the activity of the drug upon oral administration. The HA coating further enriched the antirheumatic activity of MTX, owing to its ability to improve the oral bioavailability and targeted drug delivery of the formulation. Thus, HA-MTX-SLNs can be considered efficient therapeutic agents for the treatment of RA. "
"Abstract: Sunscreen use has increased in recent years, as sunscreen products minimize the damaging effects of solar radiation. Active ingredients called ultraviolet (UV) filters or UV agents, either organic or inorganic, responsible for defending skin tissue against harmful UV rays, are incorporated in sunscreen formulations. UV agents have a serious impact on many members of bio communities, and they are transferred to the environment either directly or indirectly. Many organic UV filters are found to be accumulated in marine environments because of high values of the octanol/water partition coefficient. However, due to the fact that UV agents are not stable in water, unwanted by-products may be formed. Experimental studies or field observations have shown that organic UV filters tend to bioaccumulate in various aquatic animals, such as corals, algae, arthropods, mollusks, echinoderms, marine vertebrates. This review was conducted in order to understand the effects of UV agents on both the environment and marine biota. In vivo and in vitro studies of UV filters show a wide range of adverse effects on the environment and exposed organisms. Coral bleaching receives considerable attention, but the scientific data identify potential toxicities of endocrine, neurologic, neoplastic and developmental pathways. However, more controlled environmental studies and long-term human use data are limited. Several jurisdictions have prohibited specific UV filters, but this does not adequately address the dichotomy of the benefits of photoprotection vs lack of eco-friendly, safe, and approved alternatives.

"BACKGROUND: Alveolar osteitis (dry socket) is a complication of dental extractions more often involving mandibular molar teeth. It is associated with severe pain developing 2 to 3 days postoperatively with or without halitosis, a socket that may be partially or totally devoid of a blood clot, and increased postoperative visits. This is an update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2012.  OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of local interventions used for the prevention and treatment of alveolar osteitis (dry socket) following tooth extraction. SEARCH METHODS: An Information Specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 28 September 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials of adults over 18 years of age who were having permanent teeth extracted or who had developed dry socket postextraction. We included studies with any type of local intervention used for the prevention or treatment of dry socket, compared to a different local intervention, placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies reporting on systemic use of antibiotics or the use of surgical techniques because these interventions are evaluated in separate Cochrane Reviews. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We followed Cochrane statistical guidelines and reported dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and calculated 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effects models. For some of the split-mouth studies with sparse data, it was not possible to calculate RR so we calculated the exact odds ratio (OR) instead. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the body of evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We included 49 trials with 6771 participants; 39 trials (with 6219 participants) investigated prevention of dry socket and 10 studies (with 552 participants) looked at the treatment of dry socket. 16 studies were at high risk of bias, 30 studies at unclear risk of bias, and 3 studies at low risk of bias. Chlorhexidine in the prevention of dry socket When compared to placebo, rinsing with chlorhexidine mouthrinses (0.12% and 0.2% concentrations) both before and 24 hours after extraction(s) substantially reduced the risk of developing dry socket with an OR of 0.38 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.58; P < 0.00001; 6 trials, 1547 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The prevalence of dry socket varies from 1% to 5% in routine dental extractions to upwards of 30% in surgically extracted third molars. The number of patients needed to be treated (NNT) with chlorhexidine rinse to prevent one patient having dry socket was 162 (95% CI 155 to 240), 33 (95% CI 27 to 49), and 7 (95% CI 5 to 10) for control prevalence of dry socket 0.01, 0.05, and 0.30 respectively.  Compared to placebo, placing chlorhexidine gel intrasocket after extractions reduced the odds of developing a dry socket by 58% with an OR of 0.44 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.71; P = 0.0008; 7 trials, 753 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The NNT with chlorhexidine gel (0.2%) to prevent one patient developing dry socket was 180 (95% CI 137 to 347), 37 (95% CI 28 to 72), and 7 (95% CI 5 to 15) for control prevalence of dry socket of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.30 respectively. Compared to chlorhexidine rinse (0.12%), placing chlorhexidine gel (0.2%) intrasocket after extractions was not superior in reducing the risk of dry socket (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.20; P = 0.22; 2 trials, 383 participants; low-certainty evidence).  The present review found some evidence for the association of minor adverse reactions with use of 0.12%, 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthrinses (alteration in taste, staining of teeth, stomatitis) though most studies were not designed explicitly to detect the presence of hypersensitivity reactions to mouthwash as part of the study protocol. No adverse events were reported in relation to the use of 0.2% chlorhexidine gel placed directly into a socket. Platelet rich plasma in the prevention of dry socket  Compared to placebo, placing platelet rich plasma after extractions was not superior in reducing the risk of having a dry socket (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.33; P = 0.17; 2 studies, 127 participants; very low-certainty evidence).  A further 21 intrasocket interventions to prevent dry socket were each evaluated in single studies, and there is insufficient evidence to determine their effects. Zinc oxide eugenol versus Alvogyl in the treatment of dry socket Two studies, with 80 participants, showed that Alvogyl (old formulation) is more effective than zinc oxide eugenol at reducing pain at day 7 (mean difference (MD) -1.40, 95% CI -1.75 to -1.04; P < 0.00001; 2 studies, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence) A further nine interventions for the treatment of dry socket were evaluated in single studies, providing insufficient evidence to determine their effects. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Tooth extractions are generally undertaken by dentists for a variety of reasons, however, all but five studies included in the present review included participants undergoing extraction of third molars, most of which were undertaken by oral surgeons. There is moderate-certainty evidence that rinsing with chlorhexidine (0.12% and 0.2%) or placing chlorhexidine gel (0.2%) in the sockets of extracted teeth, probably results in a reduction in dry socket. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of the other 21 preventative interventions each evaluated in single studies. There was limited evidence of very low certainty that Alvogyl (old formulation) may reduce pain at day 7 in patients with dry socket when compared to zinc oxide eugenol. "
"Abstract: There is now unequivocal evidence that sunscreen can severely affect marine ecosystems. However, so far, most studies have focused on the impact of single sunscreen ingredients rather than on the whole sunscreen products, which are released into the marine environment. In the present work, we investigated the ecological impact of six formulations, which represent the ""new generation"" organic UV filters such as diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (DHHB), methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol (MBBT), ethylhexyl triazone (EHT), and bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (BEMT), which are progressively replacing the ""old generation"" organic UV filters (e.g., oxybenzone, octinoxate) banned in several countries of the world. The six formulations tested were characterized by a different combination of ingredients, on a model species particularly sensitive to environmental alterations: the sea urchin, Paracentrotus lividus. We investigated the sea urchin responses both in terms of gene expression and anomalies in embryonic development. We found that all sunscreen products containing only MBBT, DHHB, BEMT, and EHT as UV filters, are more eco-compatible than those also containing also ES, or other ingredients such as emollients and texturizing compounds, which may act synergistically causing molecular stress, morphological anomalies, and ultimately possible death. Overall, the results presented here provide new insights on the effects of sunscreen products based on ""new generation"" UV filters, and highlights the urgency of testing complete formulations, rather than just specific UV filters to ascertain the eco-compatibility of sunscreen products, to effectively minimize their impact on marine ecosystems.

"Abstract: Bladder cancer is the first cancer for which PDT was clinically approved in 1993. Unfortunately, it was unsuccessful due to side effects like bladder contraction. Here, we summarized the recent progress of PDT for bladder cancers, focusing on photosensitizers and formulations. General strategies to minimize side effects are intravesical administration of photosensitizers, use of targeting strategies for photosensitizers and better control of light. Non-muscle invasive bladder cancers are more suitable for PDT than muscle invasive and metastatic bladder cancers. In 2010, the FDA approved blue light cystoscopy, using PpIX fluorescence, for photodynamic diagnosis of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. PpIX produced from HAL was also used in PDT but was not successful due to low therapeutic efficacy. To enhance the efficacy of PpIX-PDT, we have been working on combining it with singlet oxygen-activatable prodrugs. The use of these prodrugs increases the therapeutic efficacy of the PpIX-PDT. It also improves tumor selectivity of the prodrugs due to the preferential formation of PpIX in cancer cells resulting in decreased off-target toxicity. Future challenges include improving prodrugs and light delivery across the bladder barrier to deeper tumor tissue and generating an effective therapeutic response in an In vivo setting without causing collateral damage to bladder function.

"Abstract: Skin disease treatment is a complex and time-consuming process due to the complex etiology, numerous side effects of conventional therapies, and difficulties in determining primary causes of the disease. Superficial wounds are often easy to treat. However, treatment of severe wounds caused by burn is challenging for clinicians. Optimum therapeutic benefits are based on the site-specific delivery of medicaments at the right time for a prolonged duration. Systemic toxicity and frequent dosing are the major challenges associated with the use of conventional therapeutics. Hydrogels are material of choice for drug delivery because of their high biocompatibility and ability to hold and release therapeutic agents. The number of hydrogels available for use in cosmetology and dermatology continues to grow during the past 1-2 decades. However, new hydrogel materials with high biocompatibility, antibacterial properties, and the ability to stimulate skin regeneration processes are in high demand. These are three-dimensional networks, which absorb a large amount of biological fluids and water. Hydrogels can be used as a biosensor, carrier systems for cells, drug delivery carriers especially for topical applications and in contact lenses. Hydrogels are highly porous carriers containing about 90% water. Stimuli-responsive hydrogels cause a change in network structure that is completely reversible in nature. The present review describes the applications of hydrogels in pharmaceutical formulations with a special emphasis on the treatment of dermatologic conditions such as acne, psoriasis, and mycosis. "
"Abstract: Melasma is acquired hyperpigmentation that mainly affects the face, can cause negative changes in self-esteem, and mostly affects women. Treatment is difficult, and different drugs can be used in mono or combination therapy. In this article, we present a brief overview of melasma, how to evaluate it, and a synthesis of the most commonly used topical therapies and their indications, including sunscreens, pharmacological agents, and plant extracts. Hydroquinone (4%) in monotherapy or combined with corticosteroids (dexamethasone and fluocinolone acetonide) and retinoids (tretinoin); arbutin (1%); methimazole (5%); kojic (2%), azelaic (20%), and tranexamic (5%) acids are the pharmacological agents that stand out. Correct application of these substances determines a variable improvement in melasma but often causes adverse reactions such as erythema, itching, and burning at the application site. Vitamin C can contribute to the reduction of melasma and have little or no adverse effects while sunscreens are normally used as coadjuvant therapies. In conclusion, we have compiled specific topical therapies for treating melasma and discussed those that are the most used currently. We consider it important that prescribers and researchers evaluate the best cost-benefit ratio of topical therapeutic options and develop new formulations, enabling efficacy in the treatment with safety and comfort during application, through the reduction of adverse effects.

"INTRODUCTION: The periorbital region is susceptible to premature skin aging and among the first areas to manifest age-related changes. Retinoids are highly effective but can be irritating, limiting use in this vulnerable area. A hydrating formulation comprised of a double-conjugated retinoid/alpha hydroxy acid (lactic acid; AHARet-EM) has been developed to address photoaging of the periorbital area. This study evaluated the efficacy, tolerability, and subject satisfaction of nightly application of AHARet-EM, and a regimen that included application of a peptide-rich eye cream (InF-E; AM) and AHARet-EM (PM). DESIGN: A 12-week, dual-center, open-label study evaluated nightly application of AHARet-EM in subjects 35 to 65 years of age with fine to moderate lines/wrinkles in the periorbital area (3-7 score based on the Fitzpatrick Classification Wrinkle Scale [FCWS]). A subset of subjects applied AHARet-EM (PM) and InF-E (AM). Investigator assessments at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12 were based on the 9-point FCWS for lines/wrinkles (1 [Fine Wrinkles] to 9 [Deep Wrinkles]) and a 6-point scale (0 [None] to 5 [Severe]) for texture, erythema, and under-eye darkness, puffiness, and dryness. Subject satisfaction and adverse events (AEs) were captured over 12 weeks. RESULTS: Twenty-six subjects, Fitzpatrick skin type III-VI, completed the study. Subjects applying AHARet-EM (n=16) demonstrated significant improvements from baseline at week 12 in the appearance of lines/wrinkles (33%; P&lt;.0001), texture (37%, P&lt;.0001), erythema (37%, P=.004), under-eye darkness (41%; P&lt;.001), puffiness (55%, P&lt;.0001) and dryness (94%, P&lt;.0001). Significant improvements from baseline were demonstrated in subjects using the AM/PM regimen (n=10) at week 12 in the appearance of texture (33%; P=.002), erythema (68%; P=.001), under-eye darkness (32%; P=.007), puffiness (64%; P=.01) and dryness (90%; P&lt;.0001). No AEs occurred related/possibly related to use of the study products. High levels of subject satisfaction were reported over 12 weeks. CONCLUSION: Nightly application of a hydrating, double-conjugated retinoid eye cream demonstrated significant improvements in the appearance of lines/wrinkles, under-eye darkness, puffiness, and dryness of the periorbital area at week 12. Morning application of a peptide-rich eye cream afforded additional benefits. The study products were non-irritating, and subjects reported high levels of satisfaction throughout the study.

"BACKGROUND: In the FULFIL trial, once-daily single-inhaler triple therapy with fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI) resulted in reduced moderate/severe exacerbation rates and conferred significant improvements in lung function and health status in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) versus twice-daily budesonide/formoterol (BUD/FOR) dual therapy. METHODS: FULFIL was a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study. Patients ≥40 years of age with symptomatic COPD were randomized 1:1 to FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 mcg or BUD/FOR 400/12 mcg. In this post hoc analysis, patients were categorized by exacerbation history in the year prior to study entry (≥1 moderate/severe exacerbation [recent exacerbation] versus no recent exacerbation). Endpoints included annual rate of on-treatment moderate/severe exacerbations up to Week 24, annual rate of on-treatment severe exacerbations up to Week 24, change from baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second at Week 24, and change from baseline in health status as measured by St George's respiratory questionnaire total score at Week 24. RESULTS: Of the 1810 patients in the intent-to-treat population, 1180 (65%) had one or more moderate/severe exacerbation in the year prior to entry, while 630 (35%) patients did not. FF/UMEC/VI versus BUD/FOR significantly reduced moderate/severe exacerbation rates in the recent exacerbation subgroup (mean annualized rate: 0.19 vs 0.29; rate ratio [95% confidence interval [CI]]: 0.64: [0.45, 0.91];  CONCLUSION: FF/UMEC/VI reduced moderate/severe and severe exacerbation rates and improved lung function and health status versus BUD/FOR in patients with symptomatic COPD, regardless of recent exacerbation history.

"Abstract: Octocrylene is an organic sunscreen whose main action is to absorb UVB radiation and short UVA wavelengths; it is used in various cosmetic products in order to provide an adequate sun-protection factor or to protect the cosmetic formulations themselves from UV radiation. This filter is believed to be a possible endocrine disruptor and is also questioned due to its allergic and/or photoallergic potential. However, it continues to be widely used, and it has been found in various environments, not least those of swimming pools, where it is evidently released by consumers, to the point that it is now considered an emerging micropollutant. The present investigation presents the possible chemical fate of octocrylene in the typical chlorination conditions of wastewater or swimming pools. A total of 11 disinfection byproducts were identified, and 6 were identified for the first time, and separated by HPLC. These products were identified through careful mass spectrometry studies and 1D and 2D NMR experiments. A formation mechanism has been proposed that justifies the chemical structures of all of the compounds identified. The ecotoxicological assessment of octocrylene and their products was carried out by employing  "
"Abstract: Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN) is one of the major complications of diabetes. Currently, centrally acting drugs and topical analgesics are used for treating PDPN. These drugs have adverse effects; some are ineffective, and treatment with opioids is associated with use dependence and addiction. Recent research indicates that transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) expressed in the peripheral sensory nerve terminals is an emerging target to treat pain associated with PDPN. Block of TRPV1 ion channel with specific antagonists, although effective as an analgesic, induced hyperthermia in clinical trials. However, TRPV1 agonists are useful to treat pain by virtue of their ability to cause Ca 2+ influx and subsequently leading to nerve terminal desensitization. Here, we report the effectiveness of an ultrapotent TRPV1 agonist, resiniferatoxin (RTX) nanoparticle, in a topical formulation (RTX-cream; RESINIZIN) that alleviates pain associated with DPN in animal models of diabetes. Resiniferatoxin causes nerve terminal depolarization block in the short term, which prevents pain during application and leading to nerve terminal desensitization/depletion in the long term resulting in long-lasting pain relief. Application of RTX cream to the hind limbs suppresses thermal hyperalgesia in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and mini pigs without any adverse effects as compared with capsaicin at therapeutic doses, which induces intense pain during application. Resiniferatoxin cream also decreases the expression of TRPV1 in the peripheral nerve endings and suppresses TRPV1-mediated calcitonin gene-related peptide release in the skin samples of diabetic rats and mini pigs. Our preclinical data confirm that RTX topical formulation is an effective treatment option for PDPN. "
"OBJECTIVE: To achieve an effective topical formulation of Methotrexate (MTX) as a first-line treatment of psoriasis, we formulated three MTX-loaded electrospun nanofibrous patches composed of polycaprolactone (PCL), Eudragit L100, and a mixture of them. SIGNIFICANCE: Topical delivery of MTX provides an appropriate therapeutic performance while circumventing the life-threatening side effects of systemic administration. METHODS: Three MTX-loaded electrospun nanofibrous patches were prepared and characterized in terms of size and morphology (using SEM), thermal behavior (by TGA and DSC), and crystalline structure (using XRD). Furthermore, the wettability and mechanical strength of samples were investigated through water contact angle and tensile strength tests. Also, the encapsulation efficiency of MTX was calculated. Subsequently,  RESULTS: All samples showed appropriate morphology, thermal behavior, and encapsulation efficiency. Also, XRD results showed that MTX is dispersed within the polymeric matrices in the amorphous state (with no crystalline region). Release studies demonstrated that MTX-loaded Eudragit L100-PCL formulation outperformed in terms of mechanical behavior and  CONCLUSION: The obtained controlled-release MTX-loaded electrospun patches seem promising to provide a long-acting topical treatment of psoriatic plaques with minimized systemic side effects.

"Abstract: The objectives of this review were to collect and summarise evidence on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of biopharmaceuticals in inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases and to inform the EULAR Task Force for the formulation of evidence-based points to consider. A systematic literature review (SLR) was performed, covering technical aspects and (clinical) utility of TDM, to answer 13 research questions. MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane were searched until July 2020. American College of Rheumatology and EULAR abstracts were also considered for inclusion. Data were extracted in evidence tables and risk of bias assessment was performed. For the search on technical aspects, 678 records were identified, of which 22 papers were selected. For the clinical utility search, 3846 records were identified, of which 108 papers were included. Patient-related factors associated with biopharmaceutical blood concentrations included body weight, methotrexate comedication and disease activity. The identification of a target range was hampered by study variability, mainly disease activity measures and study type. Evidence was inconsistent for multiple clinical situations in which TDM is currently applied. However, for some particular scenarios, including prediction of future treatment response, non-response to treatment, tapering and hypersensitivity reactions, robust evidence was found. There is currently no evidence for routine use of proactive TDM, in part because published cost-effectiveness analyses do not incorporate the current landscape of biopharmaceutical costs and usage. This SLR yields evidence in favour of TDM of biopharmaceuticals in some clinical scenarios, but evidence is insufficient to support implementation of routine use of TDM. "
"Abstract: Asiatic acid (AA), an aglycone of pentacyclic triterpene glycoside, obtained from the leaves of Centella asiatica exerts anticancer effects by inhibiting cellular proliferation and inducing apoptosis in a wide range of carcinogenic distresses. However, its chemotherapeutic efficacy is dampened by its low bioavailability. Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit therapeutic efficacy and compliance by improving tissue penetration and lowering toxicity. Thus, to increase the therapeutic effectiveness of AA in the treatment of breast cancer, AA-loaded poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) NPs (AA-PLGA NPs) have been formulated. The AA-PLGA NPs were characterized on the basis of their average particle size, zeta potential, electron microscopic imaging, drug loading, and entrapment efficiency. The NPs exhibited sustained drug release profile in vitro. Developed NPs exerted dose-dependent cytotoxicity to MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells without damaging normal cells. The pro-oxidant and pro-apoptotic properties of AA-PLGA NPs were determined by the study of the cellular levels of SOD, CAT, GSH-GSSG, MDA, protein carbonylation, ROS, mitochondrial membrane potential, and FACS analyses on MCF-7 cells. Immunoblotting showed that AA-PLGA NPs elicited an intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. In vivo studies on female BALB/c mice exhibited reduced volume of mammary pad tumor tissues and augmented expression of caspase-3 when administered with AA-PLGA NPs. No systemic adverse effect of AA-PLGA NPs was observed in our studies. Thus, AA-PLGA NPs can act as an efficient drug delivery system against breast cancer. "
"BACKGROUND: Topical retinoids like tretinoin are a mainstay of acne treatment but associated cutaneous irritation and drying may lead to poor adherence. As vehicle optimization can improve patient preference and adherence, tretinoin 0.05% lotion (Altreno&reg;) was formulated using polymeric emulsion technology for uniform delivery of micronized tretinoin and moisturizing/hydrating excipients. This study compared tolerability and participant preference of a branded tretinoin 0.05% lotion versus generic cream. METHODS: In this single-center, double-blind, split-face study, 25 adult females with acne were randomized to apply lotion and cream to opposite cheeks once daily for 2 weeks. Investigator-assessed skin irritation and appearance, as well as participant ratings of the products and skin sensations, were evaluated immediately after first use and after 2 weeks. RESULTS: At week 2, there was significantly greater erythema, scaling, and dryness (122%&ndash;144%; P&lt;0.01 each) and decreased skin softness, smoothness, radiance, and brightness (~40% difference; P&lt;0.01 each) on the cream-treated versus lotion-treated side of the face. More participants agreed that the lotion was gentle, comfortable/soothing, spreadable, absorbent, not sticky, and left minimal residue versus cream (range: 72%&ndash;92% vs 8%&ndash;36%). Agreement scores on skin sensations (eg, soft, not dry, less dull) were similarly higher for lotion versus cream. Overall, ~70% of participants preferred to take home the lotion over the cream. CONCLUSIONS: After 2 weeks of once-daily use, tretinoin 0.05% lotion was associated with less irritation and superior skin appearance/ sensation versus generic 0.05% cream, with most participants preferring the lotion over cream. These results demonstrate the importance of a well-designed vehicle formulation on tolerability and patient preference. J Drugs Dermatol. 2022;21(8): 875-880. doi:10.36849/JDD.6945. "
"Abstract: To assess and evaluate the efficacy and safety of nicotinamide 4% topical formulation for the treatment of mild to moderate psoriasis. This study was conducted on 60 patients aged 18-65 years, with mild to moderate psoriasis vulgaris. Nicotinamide 4% in a cold cream base was used twice daily for 12 weeks. Nicotinamide 4% topical treatment shows satisfactory results, more in males than in females. Some patients report disturbing irritation (burning, itching, and redness) upon the usage of topical nicotinamide treatment and were advised to wash out the treated area after 1 h of cream application, which solved the issue. No other adverse effects of treatment were reported by patients during the study period. Unicentral base, a limited amount of sample size, and 12 weeks duration of therapy and follow-up period, which may not be sufficient to demonstrate the complete therapeutic properties and side effects of using nicotinamide as a long-term treatment for psoriasis. This study reveals statistically reliable evidence of the positive impact of topical 4% nicotinamide preparation used alone on the treatment of psoriasis with minimal side effects. Thus, we can conclude that topical nicotinamide preparation may be a good adjuvant to the current treatment regimens used alone or alternate currently used topical therapeutical regimens if used in combination.

"Abstract: The burden of disease associated with acne vulgaris has continued to increase over time in the world population. This continued growth suggests that there is an unmet dermatologic need for this condition worldwide. Potential sequelae of acne, such as scarring, depigmentation, and marked emotional and psychological problems (e.g., low self-esteem), can lead to significant morbidity. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether dietary supplementation with magnesium, phosphate, omega 6 (linoleic acid calcium salt - C18:2 fatty acid Ca salt), and omega 7 (palmitoleic acid calcium salt - C16:1 fatty acid Ca salt) would help patients with acne vulgaris, and to compare with isotretinoin (13-cis retinoic acid). Magnesium has anti-inflammatory properties. Linoleic and palmitoleic acids have bactericidal activity against  "
"Abstract: Nanotechnological products have been used as strategies to optimize the therapy and minimize the side effects of topical corticoids. The objective of this study was to develop hydrogels by the addition of sclerotium gum to the suspensions of desonide-loaded açai oil-based nanocapsules and to study their biological effect using an animal model of acute skin inflammation. The hydrogels presented a pH compatible with topical application (4.4 to 5.0), nanometric mean diameter (131 to 165 nm), pseudoplastic behavior, and stability under room conditions during 30 days. The  "
"Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a therapeutic modality with high contributions in the treatment of cancer. This approach is based on photophysical principles, which presents as a less invasive strategy than conventional therapies. Combined with nanotechnology, the therapy becomes more efficient because nanoparticles (NPs) have advantageous characteristics such as biocompatibility, controlled, and targeted release, promoting solubility and decreasing the toxicity and side effects involved. In this work were developed nanoemulsions containing the methylene blue photosensitizer (MB) (MB/NE) and in the empty form (unloaded/NE). Subsequently, the mentioned nanomaterials were characterized by the measurement of dynamic light scattering (DLS). The MB/NE and unloaded/NE showed appropriate physical and chemical characteristics, with particle size ≤ 200 nm, polydispersity index close to 0.3, and zeta potential exhibiting negative charge, showing stable values during the analysis. The incorporation of the MB did not cause changes in the photophysical profile of the photosensitizer. The quantification performed showed an incorporation rate of 81.9%. Viability studies showed an absence of cytotoxicity for MB/NE in the concentrations of 10-75 µmol·L "
"Abstract: For decades, retinoids have been considered the gold standard of treatment for a variety of skin conditions.1,2 As the bioavailable form of vitamin A, retinoic acid has demonstrated the ability to reduce skin discoloration, stimulate collagen production, reduce rhytids, improve acne, and uneven skin texture.3,4 Retinoic acid is a potent drug with high bioavailability. Challenges with such a product include skin sensitivity and retinoid dermatitis.1,5 This potential irritation and discomfort may hinder patient compliance reducing visible results. The non-prescription vitamin A ingredient retinol is an effective and less irritating alternative, as it is converted into retinoic acid within the skin, causing little to no irritation when used topically. Intensive Age Refining Treatment: 0.5% pure retinol night by PCA SKIN&reg; contains 0.5% retinol, protected and delivered into the skin with a multi-layered liposomal delivery technology. This development addresses the inherent instability of retinol,1,2,3 as well as the mitigation of irritation with the goal of enhancing patient compliance and visible results. This formulation also features niacinamide and terminalia chebula to further support the anti-aging benefits of retinol. The 12-week in vivo use of this potent, yet non-irritating retinol topical demonstrates improved patient compliance and satisfaction due to tolerability and enhanced efficacy in the improvement in overall signs of healthy skin.

"BACKGROUND: Although truncal acne is thought to have the same pathophysiology as facial acne, treatment response may differ based on body area involvement. Traditionally, prescribers have relied on oral therapies for the management of truncal acne, possibly because oral therapy has been considered more convenient than topical application of medication to the chest and back. A lotion formulation may be particularly well-suited for the treatment of truncal acne. Tazarotene lotion, 0.045% is FDA approved for treatment of acne vulgaris in individuals 9 years of age or older. This pilot study was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of Arazlo lotion for the treatment of truncal acne. STUDY FINDINGS: A total of 19 subjects ranging in age from 12 to 58 years completed the 12-week study. There were significant reductions in truncal IGA (the primary endpoint) at each of the study follow-up visits. At week 12, 89% of subjects were clear or almost clear, as assessed by truncal IGA score. There were statistically significant reductions in inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total lesion counts from baseline to week 12. Treatment with tazarotene lotion 0.045% was well-tolerated, with erythema, dryness, peeling, oiliness, pruritis, and burning generally rated as trace or mild. Most subjects (64% or more) rated the lotion as &ldquo;Good&rdquo; or &ldquo;Excellent&rdquo; in general and in comparison to their prior medications. CONCLUSIONS: Tazarotene lotion, 0.045% is shown to be effective and well-tolerated for the management of truncal acne in this pilot study. Further studies with placebo control and larger populations are warranted. J Drugs Dermatol. 2022;21(7):713-716. doi:10.36849/JDD.6967. "
"Abstract: Retinoids are a mainstay of dermatologic therapy. Although prescription retinoids are more potent than over the counter retinoids, when properly formulated cosmetic retinoids offer consumers an easily accessible, reasonably priced therapeutic option. Retinol has been shown to improve fine lines and wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, skin roughness, and the appearance of photoaged skin. The efficacy and tolerability of retinol makes it preferable to prescription retinoids as many patients are intolerant of these more potent forms. In this review, we will discuss the pharmacokinetics of retinol and the clinical studies confirming its efficacy, tolerability, and safety with long-term use.

"Abstract: Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) are at increased risk for a more severe course of COVID-19, due to their pre-existing comorbidity and immunosuppression. Consensus protocols recommend lowering immunosuppression in KTRs with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, but the optimal combination remains unclear. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are cornerstone immunosuppressants used in KTRs and some have been reported to possess antiviral activity against RNA viruses, including coronaviruses. Here, we evaluated the effect of the CNIs tacrolimus, cyclosporin A, and voclosporin (VCS), as well as other immunosuppressants, on SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell-based assays. Unexpected, loss of compound due to plastic binding and interference of excipients in pharmaceutical formulations (false-positive results) complicated the determination of EC50 values of cyclophilin-dependent CNI's in our antiviral assays. Some issues could be circumvented by using exclusively glass lab ware with pure compounds. In these experiments, VCS reduced viral progeny yields in human Calu-3 cells at low micromolar concentrations and did so more effectively than cyclosporin A, tacrolimus or other immunosuppressants. Although, we cannot recommend a particular immunosuppressive regimen in KTRs with COVID-19, our data suggest a potential benefit of cyclophilin-dependent CNIs, in particular VCS in reducing viral progeny, which warrants further clinical evaluation in SARS-CoV-2-infected KTRs.

"Abstract: There is a risk of toxicological reactions due to systemic absorption and photo-instability of sunscreens. The study aimed to investigate the safety profile (cytotoxicity, phototoxicity, photostability, UV filter release profile, and skin irritation properties) of sunscreen (NLC-TRF sunscreen) produced from nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) and tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF). The cytotoxicity and phototoxicity of the sunscreen were evaluated on normal human dermal fibroblast (NHDF) and skin irritation properties was tested on skin model. Besides, the photoprotection in pre- and post-UV irradiation were analysed to determine the photostability. Additionally, the release profile for UV filters (diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (DHHB) and ethylhexyl triazone (EHT)) were evaluated. The NLC-TRF sunscreen demonstrated no cytotoxicity and skin irritation to cause cell death. It showed no phototoxic effect and high photostability up to 10 Minimal Erythema Dose (MED) to ensure high SPF value above 50 and broad-spectrum of UV absorption. The NLC-TRF sunscreen implies its safety for topical application with sustainable release profile for UV filter (cumulative release of 28% for DHHB and 40% for EHT after 8 h) due to the application of NLCs. The results suggest that the NLC-TRF sunscreen is an advanced formulation with improved stability and is safe for topical delivery. "
"Abstract: The Aron regimen is an unconventional therapy which entails frequent applications of an extemporaneously prepared three component system (a topical antibiotic, a corticosteroid and an emollient), with the intention of decolonising the skin of S. aureus whilst treating atopic dermatitis. The impact of heavily diluting these topical medicinal products, to differing extents, on formulation performance is not well understood thus was investigated in this study. Following a single application of a range of compounded Aron mixes (fusidic acid and betamethasone dipropionate diluted to varying extents in an emollient base), significant reductions in the expected drug flux across silicone membrane, ex vivo percutaneous absorption and skin retention of both drugs relative to the marketed products were observed. This was attributed to a number of complex formulation effects making such changes difficult to predict in a clinical setting. Further investigations are required to evaluate the impact of frequent applications of the Aron mix to widespread areas on clinical efficacy, antimicrobial resistance and long term side effects. "
"Abstract: This study aims to deliver Tazarotene (TZR) in a controlled manner to reduce adverse effects in the form of a microsponge-based gel. It adopts the methodology of a similar study by the undersigned authors with respect to the drug Clindamycin. Under both studies, the methodology used is emulsion solvent diffusion. Accordingly, we altered the concentrations of polymer and emulsifier to generate four formulations of TZR microsponges. Additionally, we used two types of emulsifiers and two types of solvents to develop two further microsponge formulations. We then studied the physical properties of each formulation, as well as drug-polymer interactions. Echoing findings from our prior study of Clindamycin, we found that microsponge formulations coded by T1 and T3 had superior production yield and entrapment efficiency, and their particle size was suitable for dermal application. As in the prior Clindamycin study, each of the T1 and T3 microsponge formulations were incorporated into a Carbopol gel and evaluated in vitro. The optimal formulation was found to be the microsponge formulation gel T8, which released 87.63% of TZR over 12 h. No significant interactions between the drug and excipients were found through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. "
"Abstract: Gel formulation of chlormethine (CG) has gained a preeminent role among therapies available for mycosis fungoides (MF). To evaluate the frequency of use of CG for MF treatment and to determine the limits and potentialities of CG in a real-world setting. A systematic review of articles published prior to October 2021 was performed. Articles were included in the review if a full-text English version was available. MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, and Web of Science were each queried from their date of inception with the following terms: ""mechlorethamine gel"", ""chlormethine gel"", and ""mycosis fungoides"". The reference lists of the studies retrieved were searched manually. Moreover, this study included all consecutive patients with different stages of MF (from IA to IIB) who started treatment with CG gel between July 2020 and May 2021. Data of the literature were compared to our single-center real-life experience. Of the surveyed literature, 11 publications were included in the final analysis describing a total of 548 patients with MF. Eleven patients with a median (standard deviation) age of 66 years (15.1) were enrolled and followed up, receiving CG (0.02% chlormethine HCl). Response to treatment resulted higher (90.1%) in our study population than in other real-world experiences published in literature. This systematic review supports the role of CG for MF treatment, showing its limits and potentialities. Our single-center real-life experience revealed an elevated percentage of clinical response with high safety and tolerance, demonstrating its versatile use with dose and application rate adaptability.

"Abstract: Accumulating evidence from numerous comprehensive studies has demonstrated that blue light, in particular high-energy visible light, can exert a range of harmful effects on skin cells. These forms of radiation are now known to be able to trigger oxidation reactions, DNA damage, erythema and pigmentary changes, and may also be associated with photoaging. Sunscreens protecting the skin from only ultraviolet (UV)-B and UVA rays can therefore no longer be regarded as sufficient to help prevent skin damage from sunlight, and products containing filters that can provide broad-spectrum photoprotection are required. To meet this need, a new sunscreen formulation that provides photoprotection against solar radiation with wavelengths ranging from UV to visible light has been developed, using an innovative organic sun filter with unique optical properties: phenylene bis diphenyltriazine (TriAsorB™). This article outlines the development and characteristics of this innovative filter and describes new key results from studies performed to assess the effectiveness and safety of the filter and the new sunscreen product. The studies conducted so far demonstrate that the filter has a good human and environmental safety profile. In addition, the sunscreen, which contains TriAsorB in combination with three other UV filters to offer broad-spectrum sun protection with a high sun protection factor (SPF50 "
"Abstract: Sunscreens containing broad-spectrum ultraviolet (UV) filters play an essential role in protecting the skin against the damage induced by sun overexposure. However, the widespread use of sunscreens and other personal care products containing these filters has led to these compounds being widely detected in the environment and being identified as emerging pollutants in marine waters. Concerns raised by laboratory studies investigating the potential impact of UV filters on coral communities have already led to bans on the use of some sunscreens in a few tourist hotspots. Although UV filter pollution may be just one of the many environmental factors impacting coral health worldwide, the media attention surrounding these studies and the legislative changes may lead patients to question dermatologists about the environmental safety of some sunscreen products. This review provides an overview of current knowledge on the impact of UV filters on marine ecosystems, concentrating on recent studies examining the effects of commonly used filters on organisms at low trophic levels and of how alternative approaches, such as metabolomics, can be used to further assess UV filter ecotoxicity. Current gaps in our knowledge are also discussed, most notably the need to increase our understanding of the longer-term fate and behaviour of UV filters in the marine environment, develop more adapted standardized ecotoxicity tests for a wider range of marine species, and evaluate the impact of UV filters on the marine food web. We then discuss future perspectives for the development of new, more environmentally friendly, filters that may enable the use of the most toxic compounds to be reduced without compromising the effectiveness of sunscreen formulations. Finally, we consider how dermatologists play a key role in educating patients on the need for a balanced approach to sun exposure, sun protection, and conservation of the marine environment. "
"OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of recently approved calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate (C-BD) cream. DATA SOURCES: A literature review was conducted using MEDLINE (PubMed) and ClinicalTrials.gov from 2002 to mid-May 2022. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles in English discussing the use of C-BD cream in the treatment of psoriasis were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: In 2 phase I trials, there was no phototoxic or photoallergic skin reaction at irradiated C-BD cream sites at baseline, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours postirradiation. In 2 phase III trials, after 8 weeks of treatment, more subjects treated with C-BD cream achieved Physician's Global Assessment treatment success (37.4%), compared to C-BD topical suspension (TS) (22.8%,  RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: Psoriasis has a multifactorial pathogenesis and topical treatments are considered first line. Poor adherence is a major hurdle in management; the combination of 2 separate first-line drugs may address this by decreasing the complexity of treatment regimens. A cream formulation can be preferred, and C-BD is now Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved as one. CONCLUSIONS: Newly FDA-approved C-BD cream with novel polyaphron dispersion (PAD) technology provides a safe efficacious combination therapy for mild-to-moderate psoriasis which may be preferred by some patients.

"Abstract: Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease characterized by erythematous, scaly patches on the skin. It can be effectively managed with topical therapies since they deliver drugs to target sites of disease efficiently and can minimize systemic side-effects while ensuring high patient compliance. However, conventional topical formulations are ineffective in treating psoriasis due to their poor percutaneous penetration and inability to reach deeper layers of the skin. Thus, it is important to explore new approaches for managing psoriasis safely and effectively while also maintaining patient compliance without compromising safety. Over the last few decades, a variety of nanocarriers have been extensively investigated as a new approach to delivering drugs to the skin that are effective against psoriasis. These nanocarriers are notable for their therapeutic effectiveness, increased localization of medication in the skin, and reduced side-effects. The purpose of this review is to explore the recent advances in polymer-based, lipid-based, metallic, and microneedle-based novel nanoformulations of antipsoriatic drugs. There have been detailed discussions about several nanocarrier systems including nanoemulsions, liposomes, nanostructured lipid carriers, ethosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, micelles, gold nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles, and microneedles. In a nutshell, nanoformulations are considered a promising avenue for psoriasis treatment since they offer better penetration, targeted delivery, and enhanced safety and efficacy. "
"Abstract: Acne vulgaris is a prevalent dermatological condition worldwide but is especially challenging to treat in individuals with skin of colour (SOC). Corresponding to Fitzpatrick skin phototypes III-VI, people of African, Asian, Middle Eastern and Hispanic ethnicity are considered to have SOC. With the additional risk of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) as a consequence of inflammatory acne or its respective treatment, managing acne in this population holds significant importance. PIH adversely impacts self-esteem and quality of life and, thus, is usually the patient's priority of treatment. Available acne treatments are similar for all skin types. However, some are more beneficial for individuals with SOC, in particular by targeting both active acne lesions and PIH. The acne treatment literature was searched for topical and systemic treatments that were specifically studied in the SOC population. These treatments included topical agents, such as retinoids and azelaic acid, in addition to topical antibiotics and benzoyl peroxide. Newer formulations and combined regimens reported effective in reducing lesions are less likely to induce PIH and may treat pre-existing PIH. Moisturiser use, titrating doses and patient education are strategies to minimize irritation and improve adherence. In addition, systemic therapies, including oral antibiotics, isotretinoin, oral contraceptives and spironolactone, are efficacious for refractory acne or more severe cases but specific studies in SOC are lacking. Chemical peels may improve acne and target PIH directly. Overall, based on limited evidence, topical and systemic therapies are well tolerated in the SOC population but efficacy should be balanced with the risk of adverse effects. This narrative review aims to highlight formulations and combination therapies that are effective and safe for treating acne and PIH in patients with SOC. "
"Abstract: Achieving effective treatments for various brain disorders due to the blood-brain barrier existence and the brain's complex structure has become a challenging goal. To overcome these challenges, one of the non-invasive strategies aimed at direct brain drug delivery is the use of the intranasal route. Novel drug delivery systems can be used to overcome the limitations in this administration route. This study suggested niosomal methotrexate (MTX) in situ gel formulation, which could be a suitable candidate for drug delivery to the brain. Here, niosomal MTX was prepared by a modified reverse-phase evaporation method, optimized with the aid of the design expert® software, and characterized. Optimum niosomal MTX with particle size, zeta potential, and entrapment efficiency (EE%), equal to 130.5 nm, -38.5 mV, and 91.39 %, respectively, were added into the temperature-sensitive in situ gel formulation composed of chitosan and Poloxamer 407. This study demonstrates that the simultaneous use of niosome and in situ gel formulations causes long-term persistence in the nasal cavity and helps us to have a more controlled drug release system with higher brain concentration, lower plasma concentration, higher Kp, and lower side effects compared to the free drug (MTX solution), MTX-gel (MTX-loaded in situ gel), and niosomal MTX formulations.

"Abstract: Recently, the delivery of pesticides through novel controlled-release (nano-)formulations has been proposed intending to reduce (incidental) pesticide translocation to non-target sites. Concerns have however been raised with regards to the potentially enhanced toxicity of controlled-release (nano-)formulations to non-target organisms and ecosystems. We evaluated long-term (i.e. 1 and 3 month-) impacts of a novel controlled-release pesticide formulation (nano-TiO "
"IMPORTANCE: Topical formulations of tretinoin precursors (retinol and its ester derivatives) are widely available over the counter and may offer similar clinical benefits to those of tretinoin for treatment of photoaging. However, which of the many purported molecular effects of retinoids most strongly drives clinical improvements in tretinoin-treated skin remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of topical tretinoin precursors (TTP) vs tretinoin (RA) in treating moderate to severe facial photodamage and to identify potential biomarkers that correlate with clinical efficacy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized, double-blind, single-center, parallel-arm study of 24 patients with moderate to severe facial photodamage was conducted at an academic referral center from November 2010 to December 2011, with data analysis performed from January 2012 to December 2021. INTERVENTIONS: Daily topical application of 0.02% RA or 1.1% TTP formulation containing retinol, retinyl acetate, and retinyl palmitate for 24 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Photoaging and tolerability were assessed by dermatologist evaluations and patient-reported outcomes. Target gene expression was assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction of biopsied tissue from treated areas. RESULTS: A total of 20 White women were ultimately analyzed (9 randomized to TTP, 11 randomized to RA). At week 24, there was no significant difference in Griffiths photoaging scores among patients receiving TTP vs RA (median, 4 vs 5) (TTP - RA difference: -1; 95% CI, -2 to 1; P = .27). Treatment with TTP was associated with erythema 6 times less frequently than RA (11% vs 64%) (TTP - RA difference: -0.53; 95% CI, -0.88 to -0.17; P = .01). Target gene analysis showed significant CRABP2 messenger RNA (mRNA) induction (confirming retinoic acid receptor signaling) but no significant changes in procollagen I or MMP1/3/9 mRNA in TTP-treated samples. Instead, MMP2 mRNA, which encodes a type IV collagenase, was significantly reduced in TTP-treated samples (week 24 - baseline mRNA difference: -5; 96% CI, -33 to 1.6; P = .02), and changes in MMP2 were strongly correlated with changes in fine wrinkles (r = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.80; P = .01). Interestingly, patients with severe baseline wrinkles exhibited greater improvements (r = -0.74; 95% CI, -0.89 to -0.43; P < .001). This trend was mirrored in MMP2 mRNA, with initial expression strongly predicting subsequent changes (r = -0.78; 95% CI, -0.89 to -0.43; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, there was no significant difference in efficacy between this particular formulation of TTP and tretinoin 0.02%. However, the results of these mechanistic studies highlight MMP2 as a possible mediator of retinoid efficacy in photoaging. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01283464. "
"Abstract: Visible light (VL) has been shown to increase tyrosinase activity and induce immediate erythema in light-skinned individuals and long-lasting pigmentation in dark-skinned individuals. Tinted sunscreens (TSs) formulated with iron oxides (IOs) and/or pigmentary titanium dioxide (PTD) provide functional and cosmetic benefits and are a safe, effective, and convenient way to protect against both UV and high-energy VL. We conducted an analysis of over-the-counter TSs with the objective of investigating the factors that influence consumer preference when choosing TS depending on underlying skin tone. Descriptive data for each product were collected from an online supplier that provides reviewer information. The top 10 most helpful reviews were analyzed and coded by a consensus qualitative coding scheme, which included positive and negative descriptors in 5 major categories. Most products provided only one color shade, and tone incompatibility was the most commonly cited negative feature, with the vast majority of these comments being from consumers of dark skin tones. Top recommended products corresponded with increased shade options, indicating the dearth of shade diversity in products to be a potential area of improvement in tinted sunscreen options. "
"Abstract: The antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of zinc oxide nanomaterials are popularly thought to be occurring due to zinc ion leaching, but the exact mechanism of cytotoxicity is controversial and not fully understood. Recent studies have shown that oxygen vacancy defects in the nanoscale zinc oxide can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) under dark conditions and may induce cytotoxicity. In this work, we show that the cytotoxicity of zinc oxide nanoparticles is directly correlated with oxygen vacancy defects that generate ROS under dark conditions. More specifically, we designed zinc oxide nanoparticles with controlled oxygen vacancy defects by controlled gallium doping and showed that the ROS generation property of zinc oxide nanoparticles under dark conditions is directly correlated with oxygen vacancy defects. Further studies show that superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide are the primary ROS that are produced under dark conditions. These colloidal nanoparticles are used for cell labeling and therapy  "
"BACKGROUND: A wide range of sunscreen products are available globally. Designed to meet various customer needs, they differ in formulations type, textures, ingredients, ultraviolet (UV) protection capabilities, and other properties. Knowing the factors influencing the purchase of sunscreens and the UV filters commonly used in each global region would be beneficial for dermatologists, consumers, and regulators. METHODS: Data on 50 best-selling sunscreens from each of 20 countries on 5 continents (1000 products in all) were retrieved from Amazon Marketplace during the period from January to July 2021. RESULTS: Among the 5 continents, Asia had the highest proportion of consumers (71.1%) choosing high sun protection factor (SPF) sunscreens (SPF ≥50). In contrast, Europe had the highest percentage (11.8%) purchasing <30 SPF sunscreens. The lack of standard UVA protection labeling was significantly highest in South America. The use of inorganic-based sunscreen was highest in North America, and across all continents, those products were significantly more expensive than organic-based sunscreens. Globally, lotions were the most favored formulation type. ""Nongreasy/dry touch"" (45.1%) and ""lightweight texture"" (40.4%) were the most common promotional terms used. The most common UV filters differed among regions. Iron oxide, which can function as a visible light filter, was most frequently found in sunscreens in South America (20%) and North America (19.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The regional factors influencing the purchase of sunscreen products differed. A considerable number of sunscreens may not provide adequate sun protection for consumers. Dermatologists should recommend sunscreens with sufficient UV protection that suit the skin of individual consumers. "
"Abstract: Acne vulgaris is a universal multifactorial human skin condition of the pilosebaceous units. Although acne majorly prevails in teenagers, it is neither restricted to age group nor gender. Multifarious causative factors like Propionibacterium acnes, dysregulated sebum secretion, and androgens play an integral role in the manifestation of acne. Though abundant new chemical entities are convenient for acne therapy, none can treat this condition without compromising patient compliance. Furthermore, accessible treatment prevents the ailment and alleviates signs and symptoms with no absolute cure. So presently, despite the variety of topical formulations, the current market demands an ideal remedy to fulfill the unmet need for acne management. Extensive research has proved the upper hand of novel carrier systems over conventional formulations by substantially improving efficacy and eliminating unpleasant side effects. Lipid-based vesicular and particulate systems are promising prospects due to their closeness to the intrinsic structure of the skin, which offer delivery of the actives in a more desirable approach. This review underlines the practicability and superiority of liposomes, niosomes, transfersomes, ethosomes, cubosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers over conventional therapies for acne. The review also highlights acne product market survey and available conventional as well as novel formulations portraying their scope in the market. In a nutshell, lipid-based vesicular and particulate systems prevail as a propitious modality for treating acne vulgaris as they conduce better penetrability, localized action, and reduce adverse effects. These systems have the ability to open a window of opportunities for effective acne alleviation. "
"BACKGROUND: We evaluated MK-4621, an oligonucleotide that binds and activates retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), as monotherapy (NCT03065023) and in combination with the anti-programmed death 1 antibody pembrolizumab (NCT03739138). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were ≥ 18 years with histologically/cytologically confirmed advanced/metastatic solid tumors with injectable lesions. MK-4621 (0.2‒0.8 mg) was administered intratumorally as a stable formulation with jetPEI™ twice weekly over a 4-week cycle as monotherapy and weekly in 3-week cycles for up to 6 cycles in combination with 200 mg pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles. Primary endpoints were dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), treatment-related adverse events (AEs), and treatment discontinuation due to AEs. RESULTS: Fifteen patients received MK-4621 monotherapy and 30 received MK-4621 plus pembrolizumab. The only DLT, grade 3 pleural effusion that subsequently resolved, occurred in a patient who received MK-4621/jetPEI™ 0.8 mg plus pembrolizumab. 93% of patients experienced ≥ 1 treatment-related AE with both monotherapy and combination therapy. No patients experienced an objective response per RECIST v1.1 with MK-4621 monotherapy; 4 (27%) had stable disease. Three (10%) patients who received combination therapy had a partial response. Serum and tumor biomarker analyses provided evidence that MK-4621 treatment induced an increase in gene expression of interferon signaling pathway members and associated chemokines and cytokines. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with MK-4621 monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab experienced tolerable safety and modest antitumor activity, and there was evidence that MK-4621 activated the RIG-I pathway. At the doses tested, MK-4621 did not confer meaningful clinical benefit. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03065023 and NCT03739138. "
"Abstract: Adequate treatment of pain arising from spinal surgery is a major clinical challenge. Opioids are the mainstay of current treatment methods, but the frequency and severity of their side effects display a clear need for opioid-free analgesia. Local anesthetics have been encapsulated into sustained-release drug delivery systems to provide postoperative pain relief. However, these formulations are limited by rapid diffusion out of the surgical site. To overcome this limitation, we synthesized ring-shaped hydrogels incorporating bupivacaine, designed to be co-implanted with pedicle screws during spinal surgery. Hydrogels were prepared by riboflavin-mediated crosslinking of gelatin functionalized with tyramine moieties. Additionally, oxidized β-cyclodextrin was introduced into the hydrogel formulation to form dynamic bonds with tyramine functionalities, which enables self-healing behavior and resistance to shear. Feasibility of hydrogel implantation combined with pedicle screws was qualitatively assessed in cadaveric sheep as a model for instrumented spinal surgery. The in-situ crystallization of bupivacaine within the hydrogel matrix provided a moderate burst decrease and sustained release that exceeded 72 hours in vitro. The use of bupivacaine crystals decreased drug-induced cytotoxicity in vitro compared to bupivacaine HCl. Thus, the presented robust hydrogel formulation provides promising properties to enable the stationary release of non-opioid analgesics following spinal surgery. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Currently, postoperative pain following spinal surgery is mainly treated with opioids. However, the use of opioids is associated with several side effects including addiction. Here we developed robust and cytocompatible gelatin hydrogels, prepared via riboflavin-mediated photocrosslinking, that can withstand orthopedic implantation. The implantability was confirmed in cadaveric instrumented spinal surgery. Further, hydrogels were loaded with bupivacaine crystals to provide sustained release beyond 72 hours in vitro. The use of crystallized bupivacaine decreased cytotoxicity compared to bupivacaine HCl. The present formulation can aid in enabling opioid-free analgesia following instrumented spinal surgery. "
"BACKGROUND: Adult female acne (AFA) nowadays is a very common skin condition affecting mainly women aged between 25 and 40. The treatment of AFA could be challenging. STUDY AIM: We evaluate and compare the efficacy and tolerability of a cream formulation containing two retinoid molecules (hydroxypinacolone/retinyl palmitate) combined with Iris Florentina root extract and a complex of three oligopeptides (C) applied twice a day (morning and evening) alone or in combination (C + O) with a food supplement containing a mixture of prebiotic molecules (FOS&GOS) zinc, lactoferrin, and niacinamide. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized, assessor-blinded, 12-week trial, we assessed the efficacy of these two regimens in the evolution of AFA lesions (non-inflammatory: NI-L; inflammatory: IL; and total number of lesions: TL). Additional efficacy endpoints were the evolution of the 6-point (from 0 to 5) GEA and Adult Female Acne Scoring Tool (AFAST) scores. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-four women (mean age 32 ± 6 years) with AFA agreed to participate after obtaining informed consent. They were randomized (2:1) to the topical product (n = 123) (Group C) or to the combination (n = 61) (Group C + O) treatment. All enrolled patients concluded the trial with no drop-out. At baseline, NI-L, IL, and TL acne lesion count were 15 ± 9, 9 ± 5, and 24 ± 14 in the Group C and 19 ± 8, 9 ± 4, and 29 ± 10 in Group C + O. In comparison with the number of the acne lesions at the baseline, both treatment regimens induced a significant reduction (p = 0.0001, ANOVA test) at Week 12 in NI-L, IL, and TL by -54%, -63%, and - 59% in Group C and by -55%, -73%, and - 61% in the Group C + O, respectively. At Week 12, the absolute IL count reduction vs. baseline was significantly (p = 0.0158) greater in Group C + O (-7.0) in comparison with Group C (-5.5). The GEA absolute score reduction in Group C + O group was significantly greater in comparison with Group C (-1.5 vs. -1.1; p = 0.0097). In the Group C + O, a greater percentage of success treatment (defined as a GEA score of 0/1 at Week 12) was observed in comparison with Group C (39% vs. 27%; p = 0.06). AFAST score at baseline was 2.4 ± 0.5 in group C and 2.8 ± 0.6 in group C + O. AFAST score was reduced by 21% and by 51% after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment in group C and by 22% and 55% in group C + O, respectively. Both treatment regimens were well tolerated. Not relevant adverse events were recorded. CONCLUSION: A cream containing retinoid molecules and Iris Florentina root extract is effective and well tolerated in the management of AFA. The treatment combination with a prebiotic and anti-inflammatory food supplement offers an additional clinical benefit mainly in reducing inflammatory lesions and improving the severity acne score.

"Abstract: Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an emerging transboundary, mosquito-borne, zoonotic viral disease caused by a single serotype of a virus belonging to the Phenuiviridae family (genus Phlebovirus). It is considered an important threat to both agriculture and public health in endemic areas, because the virus, transmitted by different mosquito genera, leads to abortions in susceptible animal hosts especially sheep, goat, cattle, and buffaloes, resulting in severe economic losses. Humans can also acquire the infection, and the major sources are represented by the direct contact with infected animal blood, aerosol, consumption of unpasteurized contaminated milk and the bite of infected mosquitoes. Actually, the EU territory does not seem to be exposed to an imminent risk of RVFV introduction, however, the recent outbreaks in a French overseas department and some cases detected in Turkey, Tunisia and Libya, raised the attention of the EU for a possible risk of introduction of infected vectors. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new therapeutic and/or preventive drugs, such as vaccines. In our work, we studied the immunogenicity of an inactivated and adjuvanted vaccine produced using a Namibian field strain of RVF virus (RVFV). The vaccine object of this study was formulated with Montanide Pet Gel A, a polymer-based adjuvant that has been previously reported for its promising safety profile and for the capacity to elicit a strong immune response. The produced inactivated vaccine was tested on six sheep and the level of IgM and IgG after the immunization of animals was evaluated by a commercial competitive ELISA, in order to assess the immunogenicity profile of our vaccine and to evaluate its potential use, as an alternative to the attenuated vaccines commercially available, in case of Rift Valley fever epidemic disease on EU territory. Following the administration of the second dose, 35 days after the first one, all animals seroconverted. "
"BACKGROUND: Melanin from different sources is widely used by many manufacturers to produce cosmetics and sunscreens. Research data show a wide spectrum of biological activities of melanin including the protection against UV radiation and oxidants. According to the research evidence, the topical use of melanin is more effective against inflammation than the hydrocortisone. The most common side effects of topical melanin ointment are local itching, burning, and moderate hyperemia. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this work is to describe the adverse outcomes of melanin-containing formulas in patients with solar dermatitis, and to compare the frequency of adverse reactions with data from different research reports. METHODS: A Pharmacovigilance questionnaire was developed to assess potential adverse events attributable to the use of melanin ointment. We used a modified survey tool created by Jaber and coauthors. This survey of melanin application documents validated reports of adverse events manifested by objective skin changes. MEDLINE (Ovid); MEDLINE In-Process Citations & Daily Update (Ovid); PubMed (NLM) (Internet); Embase (Ovid); and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for the evidence on adverse reactions of topical melanin application. RESULTS: The responses documented in this survey show reliability and safety of melanin formula used for the photoprotection and treatment of solar dermatitis. Most symptoms encountered in those using melanin were consistent with exposure to excessive amount (more than 4 times per day) of the compound applied topically. Of the total 534 survey responses received, 74% reported no adverse events. A total of 140 completed adverse event reports. Melanin ointment was being administered for the indications of photo injury (burns) in 75%, photodermatitis in 18%, and solar eczematous dermatitis in 7% of patients. Data were compared with rates from other reports. CONCLUSION: We have no evidence that the chemical structure of melanin varies with currently available products, used locally or in other countries, nor that any such variability played any role in the events reported here. Further studies are required to compare the adverse events of topical melanin formulas containing melanins of different origin. "

"INTRODUCTION: Betamethasone dipropionate (BD), a potent corticosteroid, and salicylic acid (SA), a keratolytic agent, have been used in combination to treat scalp psoriasis; however, undesirable side effects associated with their prolonged topical use are inevitable. In this study, BD and SA were loaded into cubosomes, a nanoparticulate system with outstanding biocompatibility, bio-adhesivity and penetration power. METHODS: Design of experiments (DOE) was utilized to prepare thirteen different cubosomal dispersions by emulsification technique using glycerol monoolein (GMO) as a lipid phase and Poloxamer 407 (P407) as a surfactant, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (SCMC) was added to enhance the dispersions' rheological properties. The thirteen dispersions were in-vitro characterized for their particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential, BD and SA content and rheological behaviour. The desirability of an optimized formula (OF) was set to the smallest particle size, lowest zeta-potential and highest viscosity. The OF was in-vitro characterized for the same parameters in addition to transmission electron microscope imaging and in-vitro drug release. The OF's anti-psoriatic activity was evaluated in-vivo using an imiquimod-induced psoriasis model. RESULTS: The OF achieved a particle size of 197.4 ± 9.47 nm, a PDI of 0.443 ± 0.025, a zeta potential of -44.4 ± 0.141mv, BD content of 105.85 ± 2.290%, SA content of 88.855 ± 2.920% with shear-thinning rheological behaviour and completed in-vitro drug release within 2-3 hours. The in-vivo studies confirmed the cubosomes' higher anti-psoriatic efficacy over the commercial product with lower changes in ear thickness, spleen to body weight ratio, psoriasis area severity index score and improved histopathological findings. CONCLUSION: The developed BD SA-loaded cubosomes exhibit promising anti-psoriatic activity attributed to its nano-size and unique lipid content, with enhanced skin penetration and modified rheological properties; increasing the formulation's in-contact duration with the scalp resulting in lower application frequency and thus reduced BD and SA associated side effects.

"BACKGROUND: Asian skin undergoing chronological aging, accumulates signs of photoaging mediated by prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Although sunscreens are effective in preventing signs of photoaging, polyphenol-rich extracts, for example, grape seed extract (GSE) can provide additional protection through the broad spectrum of biological activities. AIMS: To access the effectiveness of a sunscreen formulation containing GSE as an important cosmetic ingredient for the improvement of age-related changes in Asian skin using noninvasive evaluation techniques. METHODS: Noninvasive methods were used to assess changes in the biophysical properties corresponding to aging signs including melanin and erythema indices, color parameters of the CIE L*a*b* system, elasticity, and hydration of the forearm skin before and after applying the sunscreen with GSE. In addition, to confirm the effectiveness of the tested product, we compared it with benchmark sunscreen, and a cream base containing either GSE or UV filters. RESULTS: Twice-daily application of sunscreen containing 3% GSE significantly reduced the level of melanin and erythema and improved overall skin tone. The hydration was drastically increased after 3 h of wearing formulation and was maintained relatively high for 5 h. Skin elasticity parameters, including Young's modulus, retraction time, and viscoelasticity, improved in participants of all age categories (35-59 years). Moreover, sunscreen with GSE, as acclaimed by participants, improved overall skin appearance. CONCLUSIONS: The balancing potential of GSE on the skin, combined with the photoprotective properties of UV filters demonstrated an added value as an anti-aging agent and proved efficacy for both photo- and chronologically-aged Asian skin.

"BACKGROUND: Intravenous [IV] infliximab is a well-established therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD] patients. A subcutaneous [SC] formulation of infliximab [CT-P13] has recently been shown to be as effective as IV infliximab after two doses of IV induction in a randomised trial, but there are no data to support elective switching of patients on maintenance IV infliximab therapy. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of an elective switching programme to SC CT-P13 in patients treated with IV infliximab. METHODS: Patients on established maintenance IV infliximab, who switched to SC CT-P13, were included in this retrospective multicentre cohort study. Disease activity was monitored serially with the Harvey-Bradshaw Index [HBI] for Crohn's disease [CD] and the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index [SCCAI] for ulcerative colitis (UC) for up to 12 months at months 3, 6, and 12. Faecal calprotectin [FC] and C-reactive protein [CRP] were recorded at baseline and follow-up, if available. Infliximab trough levels were measured prior to switch and at months 3, 6, and 12 following switch. The primary outcome measure was treatment persistence at latest follow-up. Secondary outcome measures included infliximab pharmacokinetics [PK], safety, need for corticosteroid rescue therapy, and need for surgery. RESULTS: We included 181 patients, of whom 115 [63.5%] had CD. The majority [72.4%] were on 8-weekly dosing of intravenous infliximab prior to switching, and more than half [59.1%] were on concomitant immunomodulatory therapy. The majority of patients (CD: 106, 92.2%; UC: 46, 76.7%; and IBD unclassified [IBD-U]: 5, 83.3%) were in clinical remission. Treatment persistence rate was high [n = 167, 92.3%] and only 14 patients [7.7%] stopped treatment during the follow-up period. There was no significant difference between baseline and repeat measurements at 3, 6, or 12 months for HBI, SCCAI, CRP, or FC. Of the total cohort, 25 patients (13.8%) had perianal CD. Of these, only two patients [8%] had worsening of perianal CD and required antibiotic therapy and further examination under anaesthesia [EUA]. Both these patients also switched back to intravenous infliximab. Median infliximab level increased from a baseline of 8.9 µg/dl [range 0.4-16] to 16.0 µg/dl [range 2.3-16, p <0.001] at 3 months. Serum levels stayed stable at 6 months [median 16 µg/dl, range 0.3-17.2] and 12 months [median 16 µg/dl, range 0.3-19.1, both p <0.001 compared with baseline]. Among the variables examined, only antibodies to infliximab [ATI] was associated with infliximab levels (odds ratio [OR] -13.369, 95% CI -15.405, -11.333, p <0.001]. A total of 14 patients [7.7%] developed ATI; of these, nine [64.3%] were on concomitant immunomodulatory therapy. Immunomodulatory therapy was not significantly associated with development of ATI [p = 0.15]. In a subset of patients receiving escalated IV infliximab dosing frequency prior to switching, no difference in treatment persistence was observed in patients receiving weekly versus alternate weekly SC CT-P13. Patient acceptance and satisfaction rates with SC CT-P13 were very high. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients on IV infliximab maintenance therapy switched to SC CT-P13, we observed high treatment persistence rates and low rates of immunogenicity, with no change in clinical disease activity indices or biomarkers. Infliximab levels increased after switch to SC CT-P13, and only ATI was associated with serum infliximab levels. Patient acceptance and satisfaction rates were high with SC CT-P13. "
"BACKGROUND: Probiotics provide benefits for reducing acne. Previous studies showed an anti-inflammatory effect of Lactobacillus paracasei. However, the clinical evidence of topical probiotic lotion and acne treatment is still lacking. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of probiotic-derived lotion compared with 2.5% benzoyl peroxide in the treatment of mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris. METHODS: Topical probiotic-derived lotion was formulated from cell-free supernatant of L. paracasei MSMC 39-1. In vitro study showed the ability of the supernatant to inhibit both antibiotic-resistance and-susceptibility strains of C. acnes and inhibit tumor necrosis factor-α. The patients with mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris on the face were randomized to receive topical probiotic-derived lotion or 2.5% benzoyl peroxide. Acne lesion counts, erythema index, and side effects were assessed after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: One hundred and four acne vulgaris patients were enrolled. After four weeks of treatment, the inflammatory acne lesion counts and erythema index significantly decreased compared with the baseline in both the probiotic-derived lotion group and 2.5% benzoyl peroxide group (p < 0.001 in both groups) without statistically significant difference between the two groups (p > 0.05). However, the comedones were not affected in both groups. Four patients (7.69%) treated with probiotic-derived lotion and 14 patients (26.92%) treated with 2.5% benzoyl peroxide reported treatment-associated side effects. CONCLUSION: Probiotic-derived lotion is safe and effective for treating mild to moderate acne vulgaris, a comparable outcome with 2.5% benzoyl peroxide. It could be an alternative treatment of acne with more minor side effects. "
"Abstract: Cyclosporine-A (Cyc-A) was initially prescribed as systemic therapy for patients receiving solid organ transplants or in patients with graft versus host disease (GVHD). Topical Cyc-A is an ideal form of cyclosporine in the treatment of mucocutaneous disorders as it causes fewer systemic side effects and has more stable results than steroids; however, poor absorption through the skin makes the development of new formulations necessary to improve skin permeability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical Cyc-A in different dermatological conditions. A thorough systematic review was performed on PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases as well as Google Scholar, and relevant studies from 2000 until January 3, 2022, were selected. The study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Topical Cyc-A was observed to be an effective medication in the treatment of oral lichen planus, psoriasis, burning mouth syndrome, Pyoderma Gangrenosum, and Zoon's balanitis. Adverse side effects such as dysphagia, burning sensation, lips swelling, and gastrointestinal upset were reported following Cyc-A mouthwash use, whereas mild erythema, dryness, and fissuring of the skin were observed following the Cyc-A lipogel application. Topical Cyc-A was found to be a good alternative to traditional treatment regimens for immune-mediated mucocutaneous conditions. Cyc-A can be considered as a safe and efficient option in cases of long-term treatment as it does not have the same adverse effects of long-term steroids. "
"BACKGROUND: Ruxolitinib cream is a topical formulation of ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinase 1 and Janus kinase 2. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the safety, tolerability, and bioavailability of 1.5% ruxolitinib cream under maximum-use conditions in patients with atopic dermatitis. Efficacy was evaluated as an exploratory objective. METHODS: Eligible patients aged ≥ 12-65 years with atopic dermatitis, an Investigator's Global Assessment score ≥ 2, and ≥ 25% affected body surface area were enrolled in an open-label, maximum-use phase I study conducted in the USA and Canada. Patients applied 1.5% ruxolitinib cream twice daily to lesions identified at baseline for the first 28 days and continued use only on active lesions for an additional 28 days (extension period). Safety was assessed by frequency, duration, and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events. Plasma concentrations of ruxolitinib and pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed as secondary endpoints. RESULTS: Overall, 41 patients (median age, 17 years; 51% male) were enrolled and 37 (90.2%) entered the extension period, all of whom completed the study. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 13 patients (31.7%). Treatment-related adverse events were reported in four patients (9.8%). The mean (standard deviation) steady-state plasma concentration was 104 (309) nM during the first 28 days, well below the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of Janus kinase-mediated myelosuppression in the bone marrow (281 nM), and decreased further during the extension period. Higher plasma concentrations were detected in a few patients who were treated for a very high affected body surface area. At day 56, 94.6% of patients achieved ≥ 75% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index. CONCLUSIONS: Under maximum-use conditions, ruxolitinib cream was generally well tolerated, with approximately one-third of patients experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events and few treatment-related adverse events. The mean steady-state plasma concentration of ruxolitinib was well below the level expected to affect bone marrow production of blood cells, with a small number of patients exhibiting higher plasma concentrations. In addition, ruxolitinib cream showed a high level of efficacy in patients with atopic dermatitis involving ≥ 25% affected body surface area. GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT03920852. "
"Abstract: The background of this article is to develop formulations consisting of natural raw materials that are effective in diaper rash by taking advantage of the medicinal properties of zinc oxide, natural oils, and beeswax. The purpose of this research was to determine the appropriate amounts of the constituents of the formulation and to determine the optimum formulation by comparing the margin of safety (MoS), and microbiological and physicochemical properties of the best formulation. For this purpose, parameters such as pH, rheological behavior, hydrophilic and lipophilic balance (HLB), zeta potential, and polydispersity index were analyzed and evaluated to determine the optimum formulation. Besides, microbiological reproduction and 3-month stability studies of the developed product were carried out, and it has been proven that the developed product maintains both microbiological and stability properties throughout its shelf life. Furt hermore, whether each raw material used in the selected optimum formulation remained within MoS values was evaluated according to exposure doses in the literature. Whether it maintains the desired properties throughout the shelf life was evaluated by stability studies. In this article, eight different zinc oxide-based formulations for preventing diaper rash were developed, and their physicochemical properties were examined to optimize cream formulations. baby barrier cream (BBC)-8 was chosen as the ideal formula by comparing all the parameters obtained as a result of the analysis. As a result of the optimization studies of the BBC-8 formulation, the pH value was 7.2, the viscosity property was pseudoplastic-type flow, the particle size was 533.2 nm ± 6.93, and the zeta potential was -30.9 mV ± 0.72. The theoretical safety assessment of each constituent has been made according to the European Union Cosmetics Directives. According to the calculations made on each raw material in BBC-8 according to the directives, the MoS value was found to be more than 230. For the stability studies, no microbiological growth was observed at the end of the 3-month stability studies at 25 and 40°C. In terms of the development of future natural cosmetic product formulations and the defi nition of ""natural formulation,"" it gives hope to prepare a safer cosmetic product for baby rash creams that do not contain preservatives, perfumes, and dyes and consists of natural oils and zinc oxide.

"Abstract: The effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation trigger human skin reaction, which can result in erythema, photoaging, and/or skin cancer. Sunscreens play an important role against the negative effects of UV radiation on the human skin. However, they should satisfy certain criteria, with the main one being photostability, to avoid the formation of health-threatening reactive intermediates. It has to be kept in mind, however, that photo-stable UV filters have the undesirable propensity to transfer energy to molecular oxygen and generate the very reactive singlet oxygen. They should also be well tolerated, while at the same time, they should not permeate into the skin and cause toxic effects. Thus, there is an ongoing need to develop effective and safe non-penetrating sunscreen formulations. The search for innovative active substances, efficacious combinations, and the design of vehicles or carriers has led to the implementation of advanced delivery systems. This study intended to review the commonly used UV radiation thwarting agents (organic and inorganic UV filters), compile the relevant toxicity studies, evaluate their margin of safety, and assess the current situation on innovative sunscreen formulations.

"OBJECTIVE: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder. Oral or subcutaneous methotrexate (MTX) is a first-line antipsoriatic treatment, whose adverse effects can be observed even at low doses. To minimize systemic side effects, antipsoriatic drugs should be administered topically, since they could permeate the stratum corneum. As liquid crystals with lamellar phase (LP) can be helpful in promoting skin permeation, this work evaluated two MTX-loaded LPs (C1CH and C1CHCE), based on stearic acid, cholesterol and ceramides, like topical treatments for mice with imiquimod-induced psoriasis. METHODS: C1CH and C1CHCE were topically administered to mice with imiquimod-induced psoriasis. Dexamethasone cream was used as positive treatment control. Skin histology and inflammation biomarkers were assessed. KEY FINDINGS: C1CH and C1CHCE exhibited marked immunomodulatory effects and induced extensive microstructural skin remodelling on the epidermis and dermis. These formulations increased keratinization score, epidermis thickness, inflammatory infiltrate, hair follicle hypertrophy and vascular congestion in the dermis. C1CH and C1CHCE also attenuated IL-10 upregulation and upregulated IL-1, IFN-γ, TNF-α and prostaglandin E2 levels, as well as myeloperoxidase, N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase and cyclooxygenase 2 activity compared with untreated psoriatic animals. CONCLUSION: Although liquid crystals have been reported as good options for carrying topical drugs, they need to be carefully assessed on a case-by-case basis. "
"Abstract: Capsaicin (trans-8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-noneamide) is a hydrophobic, lipophilic vanilloid phytochemical abundantly found in chili peppers and pepper extracts. Several convergent studies show that capsaicin displays robust cancer activity, suppressing the growth, angiogenesis and metastasis of several human cancers. Despite its potent cancer-suppressing activity, the clinical applications of capsaicin as a viable anti-cancer drug have remained problematic due to its poor bioavailability and aqueous solubility properties. In addition, the administration of capsaicin is associated with adverse side effects like gastrointestinal cramps, stomach pain, nausea and diarrhea and vomiting. All these hurdles may be circumvented by encapsulation of capsaicin in sustained release drug delivery systems. Most of the capsaicin-based the sustained release drugs have been tested for their pain-relieving activity. Only a few of these formulations have been investigated as anti-cancer agents. The present review describes the physicochemical properties, bioavailability, and anti-cancer activity of capsaicin-sustained release agents. The asset of such continuous release capsaicin formulations is that they display better solubility, stability, bioavailability, and growth-suppressive activity than the free drug. The encapsulation of capsaicin in sustained release carriers minimizes the adverse side effects of capsaicin. In summary, these capsaicin-based sustained release drug delivery systems have the potential to function as novel chemotherapies, unique diagnostic imaging probes and innovative chemosensitization agents in human cancers.

"Abstract: Capsaicin has been used as a topical treatment for skeletomuscular and neuropathic pain. However, it has some side effects when it is applied to the skin such as burning, erythema, and skin irritation resulting in poor patient compliance. These adverse effects are caused by the rapid penetration of capsaicin into the outer layer of the epidermis and low permeation to the dermis layer. This study aimed to develop nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) embedded transdermal patches for improved transdermal delivery of capsaicin. An optimum formulation of NLCs (0.3% capsaicin) with a particulate size smaller than 200 nm, narrow size distribution, and acceptable colloidal stability was used for preparing transdermal patches. Polyacrylic acid (7%) was employed as the polymer base of the transdermal patches as it provided high adhesive performance and a sustained release of capsaicin. Moreover, the patches containing capsaicin-loaded NLCs could offer a higher deposition of capsaicin in the deeper layer of the skin compared to the conventional capsaicin patches. In vivo skin irritation studies indicated that the conventional capsaicin patches can cause skin irritation and redness, whereas capsaicin NLCs-loaded patches exhibited lower skin side effects. Therefore, the capsaicin NLCs-loaded patches could be a potential delivery system of capsaicin through the skin with possibly reduced skin irritation. "
"OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on respiratory effects of persulfate salts (PS) or hair bleaches in hairdressers and animal models exploring mechanisms behind PS-induced asthma. METHODS: A systematic review according to the PRISMA guidelines was performed. Studies published from 2000 to July 2021 that fulfilled predefined eligibility criteria were retrieved. Data were not quantitatively synthesized due to the heterogeneity of study designs, outcomes and methods. RESULTS: Forty-two articles were included. PS are indicated as the main cause of occupational rhinitis and asthma in hairdressers, and one of the leading causes of occupational asthma in some European countries. Bleaching products are indicated as the most important factor for development of respiratory symptoms, lung function decline, and leaving the hairdressing profession. Risk estimates from a good quality prospective study showed up to 3.9 times higher risk for wheezing and breathlessness in hairdressers aged ≥ 40 years than in matched controls, and 20 times higher risk in hairdressers to develop respiratory symptoms from exposure to bleaching powder than controls. Pathophysiological mechanisms of the respiratory response to PS are not yet fully elucidated, but may include non-specific and specific immune responses. CONCLUSIONS: Hairdressing is associated with a wide spectrum of respiratory adverse effects, of which bleaching products were indicated as the most hazardous. Preventive measures for reducing inhalatory exposure to PS in hair salons should be re-evaluated, including adopting occupational exposure limits at EU level, and encouraging use of safer bleach formulations.

"Abstract: Human skin equivalents emerged as novel tools in preclinical dermatological research. It is being claimed that they may bridge the translational gap between preclinical and clinical research, yet only a few studies have investigated their suitability for preclinical drug testing so far. Therefore, we investigated if inflammatory skin equivalents, which emulate hallmarks of atopic dermatitis (AD), are suitable to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of dexamethasone (DXM) in a cream formulation or loaded onto dendritic core-multishell nanoparticles. Topical DXM application resulted in significantly decreased expression of the proinflammatory cytokine TSLP, increased expression of the skin barrier protein involucrin, and facilitated glucocorticoid receptor translocation in a dose-dependent manner. Further, DXM treatment inhibited gene expression of extracellular matrix components, potentially indicative of the known skin atrophy-inducing side effects of glucocorticoids. Overall, we were able to successfully assess the anti-inflammatory effects of DXM and the superiority of the nanoparticle formulation. Nevertheless the identification of robust readout parameters proved challenging and requires careful study design. "
"Abstract: The aim of the present study is to fabricate the stable nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) using biocompatible excipients for the encapsulation of Methotrexate (MTX), a chemotherapeutic agent for breast cancer treatment. MTX has restricted clinical applications owing to its low solubility, non-specific targeting and adverse side effects. Glyceryl Monostearate (GMS) and Miglyol 812 (MI1) were chosen as solid and liquid lipids, respectively, for the fabrication of NLCs, and the influence of variation of solid and liquid composition was investigated. The prepared NLCs exhibited long-term stability and spherical shape morphology as characterized by electron microscopy. The internal structure of fabricated NLCs was arranged into cubic crystalline as confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis. MTX's encapsulation efficiency of ∼85 ± 0.9%. and sustained  "
"Abstract: This study aimed to develop a prototype skincare product with bee venom, propolis, honey, beeswax, and royal jelly. The prototype formulation contained 0.1% bee venom, 0.3% propolis extract, 0.45% honey, and 1.0% royal jelly. The prototype body cream was analyzed for stability, antioxidant activity, dermatological response, and cytotoxicity. In addition, a panel test evaluated the prototype for the claims such as skin smoothness, feelings of nourishment, moisturizing, skin tone, brightness, and visibility of wrinkles. According to the stability test, the prototype was stable for up to 90 days at room temperature and +40°C. The formulation was found to have a high antioxidant capacity at 85.45%. Cell viability detected over 70% indicated that the prototype body cream was not cytotoxic. The dermatological analysis revealed no irritation or allergic reaction in non-allergic individuals. Panel test showed that the prototype makes skin silky smooth, contributes to hydration, brightens and nourishes the skin, evens the skin tone, reduces the visibility of wrinkles, improves skin elasticity, and smoothes wrinkles. This prototype formulation requires further research to evaluate its effectiveness against skin aging on different skin types. Nevertheless, the side effects of such products need particular attention in developing a commercial product containing bee venom in susceptible individuals. "
"BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet radiation is the main cause of skin pigmentation, but more recently visible light has been shown to be an important contributor especially in melano-competent subjects. Photoprotection from visible light can improve several hyperpigmentation disorders. Recently, a visible light photoprotection assessment method has been proposed based on in vivo pigmentation; the visible light photoprotection factor (VL-PF) is determined by assessment of the change in colorimetry parameter ITA over several days measured using a chromameter. Although in vivo methods remain the most representative of real life, in vitro methods are more suited to screening sunscreen formulations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between in vivo and in vitro methods in assessing protection against visible light induced pigmentation. METHODS: We first analysed the in vitro protective properties of the 10 commercially available sunscreens using transmission measurements in the visible spectrum. Then, we performed a monocentric, double-blind, randomized controlled study with intra-individual comparisons in 20 healthy subjects and measure the VL-PF in vivo of those sunscreens. The correlation between the VL-PF and the percentage of blocked light was evaluated using the coefficient of determination R RESULTS: A strong significant correlation was demonstrated between in vivo visible light protection factor and in vitro transmittance measurements, with the highest correlation factor at 420 nm and in the spectrum covering from 400 to 469 nm. CONCLUSION: Transmittance measurements were found to be a good predictive tool to evaluate sunscreen visible light photoprotection efficacy and could be used to select formulations for final in vivo testing.

"BACKGROUND: Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) afford therapeutic benefits in some COPD patients, but their widespread use is cautioned due to an increased risk of developing pneumonia. Subclass variations exist, and the risk profile differs for individual ICS. Formulation particle size has been identified as a potential effect modifier. The present study compared the risk of pneumonia among new COPD users of fixed-dose combination inhalers containing fine-particle fluticasone (fp-FDC-F) versus extrafine particle beclometasone (ef-FDC-BDP). METHODS: A propensity matched historical cohort study was conducted using data from the Optimum Patient Care Research Database. COPD patients aged ≥40 years with ≥1 year of continuous medical data who initiated fp-FDC-F or ef-FDC-BDP were compared. The primary outcome was time to pneumonia event, as treated, using either sensitive (physician diagnosed) or specific (physician diagnosed and x-ray or hospital admission confirmed) definitions. RESULTS: A total of 13,316 patients were matched. Initiation of fp-FDC-F (mean dosage furoate 99 µg; propionate 710 µg) was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia versus ef-FDC-BDP (mean beclometasone dose 395 µg), irrespective of definition (sensitive HR 1.38 95% CI 1.14-1.68; specific HR 1.31 95% CI 1.05-1.62). CONCLUSION: In the current investigation, we found that in comparison to extrafine beclomethasone, commencing a formulation containing fluticasone is associated with an increased risk of developing pneumonia. These observations support the idea that not all ICS are equal in their adverse effects and subclass variations exist and should be carefully considered in the treatment choice. "

"Abstract: Treatment of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN) is challenging and often limited by drug tolerability and adverse effects. This review article focuses on the high-dose (8%) capsaicin patch that allows for improved efficacy and reduced application frequency in comparison to low-dose capsaicin formulations. Systemic absorption is minimal resulting in fewer systemic side effects than first-line oral medications. There is evidence that capsaicin patch treatment is well-tolerated, safe and provides effective pain relief maintained for several weeks; well-powered studies are needed to confirm these findings. The capsaicin 8% patch may benefit patients at high risk for adverse effects from oral medication, polypharmacy or inadequate pain relief from first-line therapies. Abstract: Treatment of nerve pain in the feet and other regions due to nerve damage from diabetes is challenging, often due to the unwanted side effects of medications. This review article focuses on the high-dose (8%) capsaicin patch, which can be applied directly to the feet. It is more potent than the low-dose formulations, allowing patients to apply it less often while also working more effectively compared with low-dose capsaicin creams. Because it acts directly on the skin, there are fewer systemic side effects such as drowsiness or urinary retention. There is evidence that capsaicin patch treatment is safe and provides pain relief for several weeks. More large studies are needed to confirm these findings. The capsaicin 8% patch may benefit patients at high risk for side effects from oral medications or inadequate pain relief from first-line medications. "
"Abstract: The Expert Panel for Cosmetic Ingredient Safety (Panel) assessed the safety of 46 butyl polyoxyalkylene ethers that share a common structural motif, namely a butyl chain (4 carbon alkyl chain) bound to a polyoxyalkylene (PPG, PEG, or both); 23 of these ethers were previously reviewed by the Panel, and 23 are reviewed herein for the first time. Most of the butyl polyoxyalkylene ethers have several functions in cosmetics, but the most common reported functions include hair conditioning agent and skin conditioning agent, and many reportedly function as solvents. Upon review of new data, including frequency and concentration of use, and data from previous Panel reports and on read-across analogs, the Panel concluded that these ingredients are safe in the present practices of use and concentration in cosmetics when formulated to be non-irritating.

"OBJECTIVE: Since of the last publication of last recommendations on primary large-vessel vasculitis (LVV) endorsed by the Italian Society of Rheumatology (SIR) in 2012, new evidence emerged regarding the diagnosis and the treatment with conventional and biologic immunosuppressive drugs. The associated potential change of clinical care supported the need to update the original recommendations. METHODS: Using the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE)-ADOLOPMENT framework, a systematic literature review was performed to update the evidence supporting the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) guidelines on LVV as reference. A multidisciplinary panel of 12 expert clinicians, a trained nurse, and a patients' representative discussed the recommendation in cooperation with an Evidence Review Team. Sixty-one stakeholders were consulted to externally review and rate the recommendations. RESULTS: Twelve recommendations were formulated. A suspected diagnosis of LVV should be confirmed by imaging or histology. In active GCA or TAK, the prompt commencement of high dose of oral glucocorticoids (40-60 mg prednisone-equivalent per day) is strongly recommended to induce clinical remission. In selected patients with GCA (e.g., refractory or relapsing disease or patients at risk of glucocorticoid related adverse effects) the use of an adjunctive therapy (tocilizumab or methotrexate) is recommended. In all patients diagnosed with TAK, adjunctive therapies, such as conventional synthetic or biological immunosuppressants, should be given in combination with glucocorticoids. CONCLUSIONS: The new set of SIR recommendations was formulated in order to provide a guidance on both diagnosis and treatment of patients suspected of or with a definite diagnosis of LVV. "

"Abstract: Radiation-induced dermatitis is a common complication of radiotherapy. In Spain, the manufactured products used to prevent and treat that condition consist of emollient creams (which are often ineffective) or corticosteroids (which can cause dermal atrophy and other adverse effects). However, we have found that topically applied melatonin, a product that to our knowledge is not commercially available in Spain, is safe and effective in the prevention and treatment of radiodermatitis and a viable substitute for corticosteroid therapy. In this report, we describe the use of compounded melatonin in Beeler cream (the formulation for which is provided) in a 46-year-old woman who underwent surgery and radiotherapy for early stage adenocarcinoma of the breast. The patient applied that cream as directed throughout the prescribed course of radiotherapy and continued its use for 3 weeks after she last underwent irradiation. She experienced no adverse effects from the use of the compounded formulation and tolerated that treatment well. Radiation dermatitis did not develop at the irradiated site until approximately 1 week after the final radiotherapy session, at which time mild erythema of the treated skin emerged. That condition, which was successfully treated by application of the melatonin-containing cream as previously prescribed, resolved after 3 weeks of its use. We suggest that when manufactured products designed to prevent or treat the adverse dermal effects of radiotherapy are unavailable, fail to be effective, or prove objectionable to patients, a melatonin-containing topical compound can provide a successful alternative.

"Abstract: The skin is regularly exposed to several environmental aggressions, including solar radiation, whose biological effects can induce sunburn, dyschromia, skin aging and cancer. Among the photoprotection measures, sunscreens comprise a relevant part of the strategy aimed to prevent solar radiation damage and, for effective action, the patient must adhere to the product use and the latter, in turn, must follow technical parameters to promote adequate protection. This review article brings together the most current and relevant concepts about photoprotection for dermatological use, including the challenges for their formulation, the risks of certain photoprotective active substances for individual and environmental safety and the importance of stringency in determining the product efficacy, considering the regulatory aspects, highlighting relevant differences between Brazil and other countries. Thus, when assessing a sunscreen, not only the visual aspects and sensory perception will be immediately evaluated, but also the quality and suitability of the vehicle, the chemical composition of the formulation, the environmental risks, the photostability of the screening system, and the measurement of its protection spectrum. Technical knowledge of sunscreens can help dermatologists in this important role of educating patients about the best photoprotective strategies in each situation. "
"OBJECTIVE: The harmful effects induced by ultraviolet exposition and the significant increment in skin cancer diagnosis confirm the necessity to develop effective and safe sunscreens. Limited efficacy and cutaneous adverse reactions of traditional formulations drove the incorporation of natural extracts into multifunctional sunscreens. Vaccinium myrtillus L. extract (VME), that contains anthocyanins and flavonoids, is a potential candidate for such systems. METHODS: Considering that, we performed in vitro and in vivo tests to evaluate the sun protection factor (SPF), photostability, and safety of sunscreen samples containing VME. RESULTS: As main results, the SPF was reduced in both in vitro and in vivo evaluation in the presence of VME; nonetheless, the samples were photostable and safe. CONCLUSION: Further investigation is required to better understand the unexpected effects of VME over photoprotection, decreasing the SPF value. As a conclusion, even with interesting findings, we highlight the importance of case-by-case investigations to develop multifunctional bioactive sunscreens. "

AdmetSAR software tool was utilized for the in-silico study, whereas for the in-vivo study, UV radiations are given on Albino rats using solarimeter. RESULTS: Results shown the active constituents are non-carcinogenic and non-toxic; IC50 values show good antioxidant activity and minimal effect of UV radiations after application of the gel formulation on animal skin. DISCUSSION: The results manifest prominent effects on animal skin further test for presence of ascorbic acid level and total protein in blood further verify the efficacy of the formulation. CONCLUSION: The study consequently established a strong ground for further extensive clinical studies. "
"Abstract: The effects of solar radiation on human skin differ based on the skin phototype, presence or absence of photodermatoses, biologic capacity to repair DNA damage, wavelength, intensity of sun exposure, geographic latitude, and other factors, underscoring the need for a more tailored approach to photoprotection. To date, the focus of photoprotection guidelines has been to prevent sunburn and DNA damage induced by UV radiation, both UVB and UVA; however, several recent studies have shown that visible light also generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that can contribute to skin damage and pigmentation on the skin, particularly in people with skin of color. Therefore, individuals with dark skin, while naturally better protected against UVB radiation by virtue of the high eumelanin content in melanocytes, may need additional protection from visible light-induced skin damage. The current options for photoprotection products need to expand, and potential strategies against visible light include the addition of iron oxide, titanium dioxide, and biologically relevant antioxidants to sunscreen formulations as well as supplementation with orally active antioxidants.

"Abstract: Sunscreening chemicals protect against damage caused by sunlight most absorbing UVA or UVB radiations. In this sense, 2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)benzoxazole derivatives with amino substituents in the 4' and 5' positions have an outstandingly high Sun Protection Factor and adequate photostability, but their toxicity is not yet known. This study aimed to evaluate the toxicity of three synthetic 2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)benzoxazole derivatives for their possible application as sunscreens. In silico tools were used in order to assess potential risks regarding mutagenic, carcinogenic, and skin sensitizing potential. Bioassays were performed in L929 cells to assess cytotoxicity in MTT assay and genotoxic activities in the Comet assay and micronucleus test. Also, the Salmonella/microsome assay was performed to evaluate gene mutations. The in silico predictions indicate a low risk of mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of the compounds while the skin sensitizing potential was low or inconclusive. The 2-(4'-amino-2'-hydroxyphenyl)benzoxazol compound was the most cytotoxic and genotoxic among the compounds evaluated in L929 cells, but none induced mutations in the Salmonella/microsome assay. The amino substituted at the 4' position of the phenyl ring appears to have greater toxicological risks than substituents at the 5' position of 2-(phenyl)benzoxazole. The findings warrant further studies of these compounds in cosmetic formulations. "
"BACKGROUND: Glycolic acid (GA) is a commonly used superficial peel with higher concentrations and lower pH levels leading to a stronger effect despite a higher risk of adverse effects (AE), which include burning, pain, itching, erythema, and edema. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the potential of a novel protective complex (NPC) to reduce facial AEs following a GA chemical peel treatment. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty volunteers were selected for the study. A pair of numbered kits were supplied by and randomly assigned to be applied to each side of a patient&rsquo;s face with either a 50% GA peel plus NPC or a control formulation with only a 50% GA peel. AEs, patient photographs, and standard and red filtered VISIA scans were evaluated by three independent dermatologists. RESULTS: The average post-treatment pain and itching were significantly higher in the control half as compared to the study half. Recovery time appeared to be significantly shorter in the treated side compared to the control side. CONCLUSION: The addition of the NPC to GA 50% peel is a highly effective, safe modality in the reduction of erythema, pain, and itching after peel application, and it provides an advantage in the post-treatment healing period.

"Abstract: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a recurrent chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting up to 30% of the children population, and immuno-regulatory therapy that could modify the course of disease is urgently needed. Probiotics have demonstrated therapeutic effects on AD and could potentially regulate the disease process. However, the efficacy of probiotics for AD is inconsistent among different studies, which is mainly due to the elusive mechanism and different species and (or) strains used. In this study, we designed a mixture of five strains of probiotics (named IW5) and analyzed the effect and mechanism of IW5 on calcipotriol (MC903)-induced AD-like dermatitis. We found that IW5 significantly alleviated skin inflammation of the MC903-induced AD in mice. Administration with IW5 induced increased production of regulatory T cells and regulatory dendritic cells (DCregs) in the mesenteric lymph nodes. We also found that the diversity of the gut microbiota in the mice with MC903-induced dermatitis was increased after IW5 administration, and the level of butyrate in the gut was elevated. In cell culture, butyrate induced the production of DCregs. Our study revealed the therapeutic effects of a newly designed probiotics mixture and uncovered a possible mechanism, providing a foundation for future clinical studies. "
"Abstract: Microfluidic systems have shown promise for the production of nanoparticles from mixtures of aqueous and organic solutions, including liposomes, oil-in-water nanoemulsions, and lipid nanoparticles. They offer important practical advantages, including low reagent consumption, parallelization, and automation, and are ideally suited to high-throughput optimization and scale-up. In this study, we developed a new method for the formulation of nanoparticles of poorly soluble drug compounds. The nanoparticles, prepared by microfluidic mixing using only poly(ethylene glycol)-distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-DSPE), were highly stable and uniform in size. By mixing an organic solution of poorly soluble cyclosporine A and PEG-DSPE with water in the microfluidic device, amorphous cyclosporine A nanoparticles (CsA-NPs), with an encapsulation efficiency of approximately 90% and a particle size of 100-200 nm, were obtained. Analysis of the microfluidic process parameters revealed that particle size distribution was significantly controlled by the flow rate ratio. The obtained CsA-NPs were stable for up to 150 days at room temperature, and the pharmacokinetic profile was similar to that of the commercial formulation containing Cremophor EL, which has been reported to induce serious adverse effects after intravenous administration. These findings provide a useful technical platform for the safe solubilization of poorly soluble compounds and their subsequent pharmaceutical development. "
"Abstract: In recent years, cancer phototherapy has been extensively studied as noninvasive cancer treatment. To present efficient recognition toward cancer cells, most photosensitizers (PSs) are required to couple with tumor-targeted ligands. Interestingly, the heptamethine cyanine IR780 displays an intrinsic tumor-targeted feature even without modification. However, the photothermal efficacy and photostability of IR780 are not sufficient enough for clinical use. Herein, we involve a twisted structure of tetraphenylethene (TPE) between two molecules of IR780 to improve the photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE). The obtained molecule T780T shows strong near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence and improved PCE (38.5%) in the dispersed state. Also, the photothermal stability and ROS generation capability of T780T at the NIR range (808 nm) are both promoted. In the aqueous phase, the T780T was formulated into uniform nanoaggregates (∼200 nm) with extremely low fluorescence and PTT response, which would reduce in vivo imaging background and side effect of PTT response in normal tissues. After intravenous injection into tumor-bearing mice, the T780T nanoaggregates display high tumor accumulation and thus remarkably inhibit the tumor growth. Moreover, the enhanced photostability of the T780T allows for twice irradiation after one injection and leads to more significant tumor inhibition. In summary, our study presents a tumor-targeted small-molecule PS for efficient cancer therapy and brings a new design of heptamethine cyanine PS for potential clinical applications. "

"BACKGROUND: Topical cannabinoid products are increasingly being recommended and used for a variety of dermatologic conditions. Despite this, safety and efficacy data of topical preparations are lacking, and the differences between topical and oral formulations are not well characterized. OBJECTIVE: We reviewed the literature to gather published data on topical cannabinoid products and the differences between topical and oral formulations. METHODS: The PubMed/MEDLINE literature database was searched using the terms ""cannabinoids,"" ""cannabidiol,"" ""CBD,"" ""topical cannabidiol,"" ""transdermal cannabidiol,"" ""hemp"" and ""skin."" Results were manually screened to identify published data on topical formulations of cannabinoids or cannabidiol use, adverse effects, sourcing, and solubility. RESULTS: Topical formulations of cannabinoids might be more nuanced than oral formulations, due not only to dosing differences, but also to potential differences in transcutaneous absorption. Safety and efficacy might need to be evaluated on a product-by-product basis until universal standards for topical preparations are better established.  "
"Abstract: The widespread use of conventional chemical antifungal agents has led to worldwide concern regarding the selection of resistant isolates. In this scenario, antimicrobial photodynamic treatment (APDT) has emerged as a promising alternative to overcome this issue. The technique is based on the use of a photosensitizer (PS) and light in the presence of molecular oxygen. Under these conditions, the PS generates reactive oxygen species which damage the biomolecules of the target organism leading to cell death. The great potential of APDT against plant-pathogenic fungi has already been reported both in vitro and in planta, indicating this control measure has the potential to be widely used in crop plants. However, there is a lack of studies on environmental risk with ecotoxicological assessment of PSs used in APDT. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the environmental toxicity of four phenothiazinium PSs: i) methylene blue (MB), ii) new methylene blue N (NMBN), iii) toluidine blue O (TBO), and iv) dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) and also of the commercial antifungal NATIVO®, a mixture of trifloxystrobin and tebuconazole. The experiments were performed with Daphnia similis neonates and zebrafish embryos. Our results showed that the PSs tested had different levels of toxicity, with MB being the less toxic and DMMB being the most. Nonetheless, the environmental toxicity of these PSs were lower when compared to that of NATIVO®. Furthermore, estimates of bioconcentration and of biotransformation half-life indicated that the PSs are environmentally safer than NATIVO®. Taken together, our results show that the toxicity associated with phenothiazinium PSs would not constitute an impediment to their use in APDT. Therefore, APDT is a promising approach to control plant-pathogenic fungi with reduced risk for selecting resistant isolates and lower environmental impacts when compared to commonly used antifungal agents.

"Abstract: Azelaic acid (AzA) is a USFDA bioactive prescribed against acne vulgaris. It possesses delivery challenges like poor aqueous solubility, low skin-penetrability, and dose-dependent side effects, which could be overcome by its synergistic combination with tea tree oil (TTO) as a microemulsion (ME)-based hydrogel composite. AzA-TTO ME was prepared to employ pseudo-ternary phase diagram construction. The best AzA-TTO ME was of uniform size (polydispersity index < 0.7), nano-range (~357.4 ± 2% nm), transmittance (> 90%), and negative zeta potential (-1.42 ± 0.25% mV) values. ME hydrogel composite with optimum rheological and textural attributes showed better permeation, retention, and skin-compliant characteristics, vis-a-vis marketed formulation (Aziderm™) when evaluated in Wistar rat skin. In vitro antibacterial efficacy in bacterial strains, i.e., Staphylococcus aureus, Propionibacterium acne, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, was evaluated employing agar well plate diffusion and broth dilution assay. ME hydrogel has shown an increase in zone of inhibition by two folds and a decrease in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by eightfold against P. acnes vis-a-vis AzA. Finally, ME hydrogel composite exhibited a better reduction in the papule density (93.75 ± 1.64%) in comparison to Aziderm™ 72.69 ± 4.67%) on acne as developed in rats by inducing testosterone. Thus, the developed AzA-TTO ME hydrogel composite promises an efficacious and comparatively safer drug delivery system for the topical therapy of acne vulgaris. "
"Abstract: Methotrexate (MTX) is a common drug used for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment; however, a series of adverse effects associated with its oral or subcutaneous administration is reported. Transdermal delivery of MTX is an alternative to abate these issues, and the use of drug delivery systems (DDS) based on polymeric films presents an impressive potential for this finality. Based on this, in this study, we report the preparation of films made by cationic starch (CSt), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and chondroitin sulfate (ChS) to incorporate and release MTX, as well as the in vivo evaluation in model of rheumatoid arthritis in mice. CSt/PVA and CSt/PVA/ChS-based films (with and without MTX) were prepared using a simple protocol under mild conditions. The films loaded with 5 w/w-% of MTX exhibited appreciable drug loading efficiency and distribution. The MTX permeation through the layers of porcine skin demonstrated that most of the drug permeated was detected in the medium, suggesting that the formulation can provide a systemic absorption of the MTX. In vivo studies performed in an arthritis-induced model in mice demonstrated that the MTX-loaded films were able to treat and attenuate the symptoms and the biochemical alterations related to RA (inflammatory process, oxidative stress, and nociceptive behaviors). Besides, the pharmacological activity of MTX transdermally delivery by the CSt/PVA and CSt/PVA/ChS films was comparable to the MTX orally administered. Based on these results, it can be inferred that both films are prominent materials for incorporation and transdermal delivery of MTX in a practical and non-invasive manner. "
"BACKGROUND: While sunbathing of performing outdoor sport activities, sunscreens are important for protection of uncovered skin against ultraviolet (UV) radiation. However, perspiration negatively affects the performance of a sunscreen film by weakening its substantivity and uniformity through the activation of two mechanisms, namely sunscreen wash-off and sunscreen redistribution. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used a perspiring skin simulator to investigate the effect of sunscreen formulation on its efficiency upon sweating. Specifically, we modified the sunscreen formulation by incorporating a hydrophobic film former and adding water-absorbing particles. Sunscreen performance before and after perspiration is assessed by in vitro sun protection factor measurements, direct detection of changes in the sunscreen distribution using UV reflectance imaging, and by coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy for microscopic characterization of the UV filter relocation. RESULTS: The results show that incorporating a hydrophobic film former can decrease sunscreen wash-off due to sweating, while an excessive amount of film former might negatively affect the sunscreen distribution. The addition of water-absorbing particles, on the other hand, had either a negative or positive impact on the sunscreen substantivity, depending on the particle properties. While the addition of large water-absorbing particles appeared to increase sunscreen redistribution, smaller particles that could form a gel-like structure upon contact with water, appeared to change sunscreen wetting and sweat droplet spreading, thereby decreasing sunscreen wash-off and sunscreen redistribution. CONCLUSIONS: We find that using a combination of hydrophobic film formers, which increase water resistance, and small water-absorbing particles, which change the wetting behavior, can make sunscreen formulations more sweat-resistant and less runny.

"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: ShexiangZhuifeng Analgesic Plaster (SZAP) is a traditional Chinese medicine and transdermal formulation composed of many Chinese herbs and active compounds. SZAP was recently approved by the China Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarticular diseases and is preferred by most rheumatoid arthritis patients in China. However, its mechanism has not been elucidated in detail. AIM OF THE STUDY: We sought to determine the analgesic effect of SZAP in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats and explore the underlying mechanisms of pain transmission, such as via the TRPV1 and P2X3 receptors. METHODS: After CIA was established, rats were treated with SZAP for 7 days. Paw thickness, arthritis score, and haematoxylin and eosin staining were used to evaluate the effectiveness of SZAP. Paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) and tail-flick latency (TFL) were used to estimate the analgesic effect of SZAP. The levels of PGE RESULTS: SZAP not only significantly ameliorated arthritis scores and paw thickness by improving the pathological damage of synovial joints, but also remarkably alleviated pain in CIA rats. Further, treatment with SZAP significantly reduced peripheral 5-HT, PGE CONCLUSION: SZAP ameliorates rheumatalgia by suppressing hyperalgesia and pain transmission through the inhibition of TRPV1 and P2X3 in the DRG of CIA rats.

"BACKGROUND/AIMS: In order to define a label SPF of topically applied sunscreens, in vivo test methods like ISO 24444, FDA Guideline, and the Australian Standard are used worldwide. The basis of all these methods is to induce an erythemal skin reaction by UV irradiation to find the level of MEDu and MEDp (Minimal Erythmal Dose unprotected and protected). In vitro methods replacing the human skin by any kind of nonhuman material are still not available. Thus, offering the new hybrid diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (HDRS) technique that can maintain an in vivo level for SPF testing while neglecting the UV-dose-related erythemal skin reaction is a perfect combination to take care of sun protection and any ethical concerns in SPF testing nowadays. METHODS: HDRS is a combination of in vivo diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements on the skin and in vitro transmission measurements of a sunscreen on a roughened polymethylmethacrylate plate. By this technique, the in vivo behavior of the investigated sunscreen on the skin is measured as well as the UVB absorption, which is still nonvisible in the reflectance technique. In order to establish an alternative method for in vivo SPF and UVA-PF testing, a huge number of sunscreens (250 samples) were measured by HDRS and compared with the worldwide accepted standards ISO 24444, ISO 24442, and ISO 24443. The variety of sunscreens measured reflect a wide range of different types of formulations as well as a wide range of SPFs (5-120) to validate this new alternative SPF testing procedure. RESULTS: Far-reaching statistical data analyses show an excellent link between the new nonerythemal-driven HDRS-SPF technique and ISO 24444 results. In the same way, HDRS-UVA-PF results can be correlated with UVA-PF values calculated from ISO 24442 as well as from ISO 24443. The importance of the inclusion of a spectral ratio of photodegradation is shown in the comparison of photostable and photounstable products. CONCLUSION: Owing to the elimination of any erythemal-relevant UVB and UVA doses, absolutely no skin reaction occurs during the HDRS experiment. Consequently, there is no need to define an MED anymore. For the first time, an alternative way to arriving at SPF and UVA-PF values is shown, without any ethical concerns of SPF testing in vivo and/or any restriction of SPF testing in vitro. Regardless of the type of formulation or the level of protection, an excellent correlation between SPFHDRSand SPF24444as for sunscreen labeling could be found. By this new alternative nonerythemal technique, not only SPF values can be measured but also UVA-PF values can be calculated with a linear correlation to ISO 24442 as well as to ISO 24443 from the same set of data. By this a robust alternative test method of SPF and UVA-PF values is described, taking into account the interaction of sunscreen formulation and skin. "
"Abstract: Sunscreens used for the protection of human skin work by attenuating the potentially harmful solar UV radiation. In recent years, the quantitative understanding of this attenuating effect has grown tremendously, enabling model calculations of sunscreen performance. Such calculations are based on the simulation of the UV transmission of the sunscreen film applied on human skin. However, there are 2 prerequisites assumed to hold. The first prerequisite is the applicability of the Beer-Lambert law for sunscreen films, and the second is that the thickness variation of the sunscreen film can be described with a gamma distribution of film heights. There is strong evidence from recent experimental work that both assumptions are correct. For several applications, calculations of sunscreen performance have been shown to be useful, for instance, in the design of new sunscreen formulations aiming for a certain sun protection factor or other characteristics, prediction of pre-vitamin D production in the skin in the presence of sunscreen, in vitro measurement of water resistance, and assessment of the ecotoxicological profile of a sunscreen formulation or the influence of oil polarity on UV-filter absorbance and the consequence for sunscreen performance.

"Abstract: Developing efficient sunscreen products with an acceptable sensory feel after application on skin, that meet current regulatory market and consumer requirements, is a major challenge, exacerbated by new restrictions limiting the use of certain ingredients previously considered crucial. This paper outlines a development strategy for -formulating sunscreens along a generic professional development pathway. Each galenic system will be different and must be customized. Development starts with benchmarking, followed by UVA/UVB filter platform selection and in silico calculation/optimization of photoprotection performance for the desired SPF, UVA-PF, and other requested endpoints. Next comes the selection of the emulsifier system and other key formulation ingredients, such as oil components, triplet quenchers, and antioxidants, with sensory, rheological, and film formation functions. Preliminary cost estimation is then performed to -complete the conceptual process before the start of the practical galenic development. The successful development of modern sunscreen products is based on -comprehensive expertise in chemistry, galenic methodology, regulation, and patenting, as well as specific -market and consumer requirements. The selection of the UV filters is the first key decision and constrains later choices. Other properties, such as water resistance and preservation or active ingredients, may need to be considered. The 4 basic requirements of efficacy, safety, registration, and patent freedom become checklist items to ensure that after development, a sunscreen product has a chance of success. "
"Abstract: Exposure to ultraviolet radiation increases the risk of adverse health effects, predominantly skin cancer, which is the most common cancer among Caucasians. A large number of studies have shown that most of the people are aware of this risk and that sun protection behavior is a preventative measure. Nevertheless, despite the numerous public efforts made during the last decades, a large number of people still do not comply with sun protection practices recommended for sun safety. Public discussion about sunscreen safety and the idealization of a healthy tan are existing barriers for adequate protection. Research studies should continue to examine individual sun protection behavior for the development of target-orientated interventions. This will enable individuals to formulate a correct judgment of their own susceptibility and to handle perceived barriers for sun protection with a supportive environment. "
"Abstract: Effective skin protection of consumers by sunscreens can only be achieved when meaningful and reliable test methods are available to objectively measure the protection of sunscreen products. Quantitative, scientifically sound, and valid methods to detect UVB and UVA light protection as well as methods to assess sunscreen substantivity to water are required. Continuous improvement and, if necessary, extension of the test methods are important to provide optimum protection from harmful sun rays to the consumer. This work documents the historical background of the development of sunscreen test methods and provides the actual worldwide status of applied methods. Future developments and trends are discussed as far as they actually become apparent. "

"Abstract: In acne management, oral isotretinoin (IST) is associated with various untoward systemic effects, while its topical formulation has irritation side effects. Delonix (DLX) is a natural galactomannan derived from Delonix regia seed that can fabricate nanoparticles for topical skin delivery. This study aims to develop IST-DLX nanoparticles and assess their prospects for acne treatment. Fluorescent-DLX nanoparticles (made with a lipophilic BODIPY dye) or IST-DLX nanoparticles were prepared and characterized. BODIPY-DLX nanoparticles' skin distribution and IST-DLX nanoparticles' in-vitro targeting were assessed in pig ear skin, inflammatory modulation was assessed in AMJ-2 macrophage cells, while skin penetration and irritation were assessed in Wistar rats. IST-DLX nanoparticles had ≈230 nm, negative zeta potential, and ≈30% encapsulation efficiency. Confocal showed BODIPY in DLX nanoparticles accumulated in hair follicles as compared to BODIPY solution. IST-DLX nanoparticles released ≈37% IST over 48 h and increased IST 3-fold in hair follicles compared to IST solution. IST-DLX nanoparticles suppressed IL-6 expression in cells and reduced photo-irritation in Wistar rats compared to IST solution. In conclusion, IST-DLX nanoparticles may target and deliver adequate IST to skin layers associated with acne, avoid systemic penetration, modulate inflammatory pathogenic acne stage and prevent IST topical photo-irritation.

"BACKGROUND: Sunscreens are widely used to protect the skin against the harmful effects of solar radiation. It is not known whether solar protection factor of a sunscreen is altered by the concomitant use of other cosmetic products. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyze changes in the protective effect of different commercial and ISO standards sunscreens with high SPF applied shortly before and after application of non-sunscreens galenic formulas type moisturizing creams. METHODS: ISO 24444:2019 standard sunscreens, which claimed SPF 16 and 63, as well as 4 different claimed SPF 50 and 50+ commercial sunscreens were prepared and applied in different sequential order to the back of 25 volunteers and compared with different commercial moisturizing formulas. Ultraviolet (UV) reflectance photography followed by image analysis was used to compare untreated skin and skin treated with moisturizing creams alone and combined with sunscreens. RESULTS: The UV reflectance analysis showed no significant changes of the skin color reflectance treated with moisturizing cream compared with untreated skin. Application of the sunscreen formulations were associated with a 35% - 70% decrease in color related to the in vivo expected SPF, indicating significant UV absorption for all sunscreen formulas. All standard and commercial sunscreens showed no significant differences in UV reflection color level when combined with the different moisturizing creams applied before or after the sunscreen. CONCLUSIONS: Effectiveness of low- and high-protection sunscreens were not altered by the concomitant use of a moisturizing creams applied shortly before and after the sunscreens. "

"Abstract: Pressure ulcers development is an undesirable event that often worsens the clinical condition of patients already affected by severe pathologies. Since the aetiology of this clinical complication is unclear yet, at current the primary approach to treat the problem is the adoption of suitable patients' assistance procedures. At the same time, the research focuses on finding medicaments or treatment strategies that could prevent the lesions and/or accelerate their healing. The international market's wide range of cosmetic/pharmaceuticals products is mainly topical preparations based on emollient agents to preserve or restore skin homeostasis. On the other hand, the skin microbiome's implication in the pressure ulcers occurrence is mainly unknown. Based on these assumptions, here we tested an innovative preparation, the LimpiAD foam, as a potential preventive strategy of pressure ulcers onset. The active component of this product is composed of hyaluronic acid conjugated with a bacterial cell wall fragment of C. acnes DSM 28251. For LimpiAD foam, we hypothesised a combined action of the two components on the skin tissue, an emollient effect due to the hyaluronic acid properties together with a modulatory effect on the skin microbiota carried out by the component of bacterial derivation. Our results supported the hypothesis and suggested a potential role of LimpiAD foam in pressure ulcers prevention. "
"Abstract: Sunscreen safety and efficacy is generally evaluated based upon the properties of the individual chemicals in a formulation. However, the photostability of sunscreens has been shown to be highly dependent on the mixture of chemicals present. To better understand how sunscreen formulation influences stability, and to establish a foundation for probing the influence of zinc oxide additives, we formulated five different small-molecule based ultraviolet-filter (UV-filter) mixtures with a Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of 15. These mixtures contained active ingredients approved in either the United States or European Union and were designed to represent formulations of actual products on the market. We evaluated the photostability and toxicity of these mixtures in the absence and presence of zinc oxide after UV exposure for two hours. Changes in UV absorbance were minimal for all five small-molecule-based mixtures without zinc oxide. The presence of either micro- or nano-sized zinc oxide caused significant small-molecule photodegradation and the degraded mixtures exhibited higher levels of toxicity in embryonic zebrafish assays. This study suggests that caution must be taken when formulating sunscreens containing both zinc oxide and small-molecule UV-filters to avoid unintended consequences during use. "

"BACKGROUND: Plaque psoriasis is a common, chronic and relapsing inflammatory skin disease clinically characterized by erythema and scaling desquamation. As over 90% of psoriasis patients benefit from topical therapies, local treatments continue to play an eminent role in management strategies. One such topical treatment is the fixed dose combination of calcipotriol (CAL) and betamethasone dipropionate (BDP). OBJECTIVES: Pooled analysis of two different phase 3 clinical trails to compare superiority regarding efficacy, safety and quality of life (QoL) between CAL/BDP PAD-cream and CAL/BDP TS. METHODS: The data from two phase 3, multicentre, randomized, investigator-blind, active and vehicle-controlled trials enrolling patients with psoriasis were pooled and analysed. Investigational products included a CAL/BDP cream based on PAD™ Technology (PAD-cream) designed for high skin penetration and increased patient preference, an active control (marketed CAL/BDP topical suspension/gel, in the following abbreviated as CAL/BDP TS) and cream vehicle, which were applied once daily for 8 weeks. RESULTS: Efficacy and safety of the novel CAL/BDP PAD-cream formulation for the topical treatment of psoriasis demonstrated superiority for all efficacy end points after 8 weeks of treatment. PGA treatment success for CAL/BDP PAD-cream (43.2%) was greater than CAL/BDP TS (31.9%; P < 0.0001), the mean per cent reduction in mPASI for CAL/BDP PAD-cream was 64.6% compared to 56.4% for CAL/BDP TS (P < 0.0001) and DLQI 0/1 was obtained by 43.8% in the CAL/BDP PAD-cream group versus 34.2% in the CAL/BDP TS group (P = 0.0005). There was no adverse drug reaction reported with a frequency of >1%, associated with the CAL/BDP PAD-cream. CONCLUSIONS: The novel fixed dose combination CAL/BDP PAD-cream offers greater efficacy, superior patient QoL and equivalent favourable safety for the topical treatment of psoriasis, in comparison to the currently available topical suspension/gel.

"Abstract: Topical opioid formulations offer a potential solution to manage pain and decrease the use of systemic opioids. Synthesis of use and efficacy of topical opioids in dermatological conditions has not been well characterized. We conducted a systematic search of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases from 1980 to February 2021. This study analyzed data from 14 articles and 263 patients on the use of topical opioids for pain related to chronic ulcers, burns, oral lichen planus, photodynamic therapy, and split-thickness skin grafts. Topical opioids included in this review were topical morphine and diamorphine. Common formulations consisted of 0.2-10 mg of opioid compounded with hydrogel or IntraSite gel. Topical opioids were variably effective in the use for pain control related to chronic ulcers and other dermatologic conditions. For example, the use of topical opioids appears to be effective in the reduction of pain related to pressure ulcers. Topical opioids were generally well tolerated. Insufficient data exist to adequately evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical opioid use in the context of nonpressure ulcers, burns, oral lichen planus, photodynamic therapy, and split-thickness skin grafts.

"Abstract: Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease is associated with growth failure due to chronic inflammation, nutrient disorder, and the side effects of drugs, such as corticosteroids. Biological agents are therapeutic drugs that significantly improve the prognosis of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The effectiveness of ustekinumab has been reported in the management of adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease. There are very few reports regarding the effectiveness and safety of ustekinumab in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease, especially those who are biologically naive. A 10-year-old girl presented with chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. Colonoscopy showed a longitudinal ulcer and cobblestone appearance in the ileum and discontinuous inflammation of the colon; therefore, she was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. She was prescribed a fat-restricted diet, elemental diet, 5-aminosalicylic acid, transient prednisolone, and ustekinumab. She achieved clinical and endoscopic remission based on the weighted Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index, fecal calprotectin, and colonoscopy findings at week 75. This patient developed no adverse events, such as infusion reaction or susceptibility to infection over the 75 weeks. The use of ustekinumab as the first biological agent may be an effective and safe treatment for pediatric Crohn's disease. "

"Abstract: Transdermal drug delivery for local or systemic therapy provides a potential anticancer modality with a high patient compliance. However, the drug delivery efficiency across the skin is highly challenging due to the physiological barriers, which limit the desired therapeutic effects. In this study, we prepared liposome-in-hydrogels containing a tumor targeting photosensitizer IR780 (IR780/lipo/gels) for tumor photothermal therapy (PTT). The formulation effectively delivered IR780 to subcutaneous tumor and deep metastatic sites, while the hydrogels were applied on the skin overlying the tumor or on an area of distant normal skin. The photothermal antitumor activity of topically administered IR780/lipo/gels was evaluated following laser irradiation. We observed significant inhibition of the rate of the tumor growth without any toxicity associated with the topical administration of hydrogels. Collectively, the topical administration of IR780/lipo/gels represents a new noninvasive and safe strategy for targeted tumor PTT. "

"Abstract: In recent years tremendous effort has been invested in the field of cancer diagnosis and treatment with an overall goal of improving cancer management, therapeutic outcome, patient survival, and quality of life. Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), which works on the principle of light-induced activation of photosensitizers (PS) leading to Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) mediated cancer cell killing has received increased attention as a promising alternative to overcome several limitations of conventional cancer therapies. Compared to conventional therapies, PDT offers the advantages of selectivity, minimal invasiveness, localized treatment, and spatio-temporal control which minimizes the overall therapeutic side effects and can be repeated as needed without interfering with other treatments and inducing treatment resistance. Overall PDT efficacy requires proper planning of various parameters like localization and concentration of PS at the tumor site, light dose, oxygen concentration and heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment, which can be achieved with advanced imaging techniques. Consequently, there has been tremendous interest in the rationale design of PS formulations to exploit their theranostic potential to unleash the imperative contribution of medical imaging in the context of successful PDT outcomes. Further, recent advances in PS formulations as activatable phototheranostic agents have shown promising potential for finely controlled imaging-guided PDT due to their propensity to specifically turning on diagnostic signals simultaneously with photodynamic effects in response to the tumor-specific stimuli. In this review, we have summarized the recent progress in the development of PS-based multifunctional theranostic agents for biomedical applications in multimodal imaging combined with PDT. We also present the role of different imaging modalities; magnetic resonance, optical, nuclear, acoustic, and photoacoustic in improving the pre-and post-PDT effects. We anticipate that the information presented in this review will encourage future development and design of PSs for improved image-guided PDT for cancer treatment. "
"Abstract: Self-assembled nanostructures of amphiphilic gradient copoly(2-oxazoline)s have recently attracted attention as promising delivery systems for the effective delivery of hydrophobic anticancer drugs. In this study, we have investigated the effects of increasing hydrophobic side chain length on the self-assembly of gradient copolymers composed of 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline as the hydrophilic comonomer and various 2-(4-alkyloxyphenyl)-2-oxazolines as hydrophobic comonomers. We show that the size of the formed polymeric nanoparticles depends on the structure of the copolymers. Moreover, the stability and properties of the polymeric assembly can be affected by the loading of hypericin, a promising compound for photodiagnostics and photodynamic therapy (PDT). We have found the limitation that allows rapid or late release of hypericin from polymeric nanoparticles. The nanoparticles entering the cells by endocytosis decreased the hypericin-induced PDT, and the contribution of the passive process (diffusion) increased the probability of a stronger photoeffect. A study of fluorescence pharmacokinetics and biodistribution revealed differences in the release of hypericin from nanoparticles toward the quail chorioallantoic membrane, a preclinical model for  "
"PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a topical water-free cyclosporine A formulation (CyclASol 0.1% ophthalmic solution) in comparison with vehicle for the treatment of dry eye disease (DED). METHODS: Three hundred twenty-eight patients were enrolled in this prospective, 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, confirmatory, vehicle-controlled clinical study. After a 2-week run-in period, eligible DED patients were randomized 1:1 to either CyclASol 0.1% or vehicle twice daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in total corneal fluorescein staining (National Eye Institute scale), and the second hierarchical primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in the Ocular Surface Disease Index score, both at 4 weeks. Secondary efficacy and safety assessments included conjunctival lissamine green staining (Oxford scale), visual analog scales for dry eye symptoms, and adverse event. RESULTS: Treatment with CyclASol 0.1% was superior to vehicle in the primary endpoint: total corneal fluorescein staining at week 4 (Δ -0.8; 95% confidence interval, -1.3 to -0.4; P = 0.0002, analysis of covariance). This difference had already reached statistical significance after 2 weeks and was maintained throughout the study. The study did not statistically meet its second hierarchically tested primary endpoint: Ocular Surface Disease Index score (P = 0.2634). However, CyclASol 0.1% treatment showed statistically significant improvement compared with that of vehicle in the eye dryness score at week 4 (Δ -4.783; 95% confidence interval, -9.129 to -0.438; P = 0.0311). CONCLUSIONS: CyclASol 0.1% was effective in treating signs and symptoms of DED. It significantly reduced corneal and conjunctival staining and improved ocular dryness compared with vehicle. CyclASol 0.1% was safe and showed excellent tolerability. "
"PURPOSE: Intravenous (IV) sodium bicarbonate is considered standard therapy for high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) urine alkalinization. Due to a national IV sodium bicarbonate shortage, an oral (PO) sodium bicarbonate protocol was implemented by Alberta Health Services (AHS) for HDMTX urine alkalinization. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the PO sodium bicarbonate protocol compared to IV sodium bicarbonate for HDMTX urine alkalinization. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of adult patients who received HDMTX (> 500 mg/m RESULTS: A total of 84 and 78 HDMTX cycles were included in the IV and PO cohorts, respectively. No difference in time to methotrexate clearance was seen between the IV and PO cohorts, 91.6 (± 35.4) hours and 95.2 (± 44) hours respectively; p = 0.5. The proportion of HDMTX cycles that experienced a > 25% increase in serum creatinine was not statistically significant, IV protocol 12% and PO protocol 5%; p = 0.13. Nausea and emesis occurred more frequently in the PO cohort than the IV cohort, though rarely resulted in refused doses or change to alternate sodium bicarbonate formulations. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that the AHS PO sodium bicarbonate protocol was no different in time to methotrexate clearance or rates of increased serum creatinine when compared to IV sodium bicarbonate.

"BACKGROUND: There are different topical corticosteroid (TCS) agents and potencies available to treat various dermatological disorders. There have been a number of publications on steroid phobia among general practitioners and patients, resulting in non-adherence and unresolved skin conditions, affecting patients' quality of life and healthcare costs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to discuss the process of selection of TCS for the treatment of a particular condition. DISCUSSION: It is crucial to choose the correct potency of TCS for treatment to avoid steroid phobia and undertreated conditions. TCS agents have different formulations, percentages and molecular structures, which affect potency, efficacy and effect. The adverse effects from TCS treatment are rare if the agent is correctly selected and applied. Patients can generally be treated effectively - without undesirable effects, steroid phobia and undertreated conditions - by factoring in patient and lesion characteristics, topical medication potency and method of application.

"Abstract: There is a need for new topical antipruritics that are effective on many types of itch. This study examined the antipruritic efficacy of a new formulation of topical acetaminophen. In vitro skin permeability studies showed that 2.5% and 5% formulations are able to rapidly deliver an adequate amount of the drug into the skin. In a double-blind, vehicle-controlled, randomized study in 17 healthy volunteers, 1%, 2.5% and 5% acetaminophen gels and a vehicle gel were applied to the skin prior to histaminergic and non-histaminergic itch induction and assessment of thermal pain thresholds. The 2.5% and 5% gel formulations significantly reduced the itch intensity time course and the area under the curve for both histamine and cowhage itch. No effect was noted on heat pain thresholds and no adverse effects were observed. These results suggest that topical acetaminophen would be a safe and effective over-the-counter medication for itch.

"Abstract: Toxicity from the intentional misuse of over-the-counter (OTC) combination cold products has been widely recognized. Adolescents are most frequently involved and dextromethorphan containing products are the most popular. Desired symptoms include stimulatory effects, euphoria, hallucinations, and dissociation. Potential adverse effects include tachycardia, agitation, hyperthermia, acidosis, and coma. However, mortality is rare [ 1-3]. Co-formulated ingredients such as acetaminophen, pseudoephedrine, and antihistamines may also be present and potentiate dangerous effects. We report a case of an adolescent decedent with markedly elevated postmortem chlorpheniramine (CPA) and dextromethorphan (DXM) blood concentrations and no other identifiable cause of death. "
"Abstract: Spodoptera frugiperda is an important pest of several crops. Use of chemical insecticides in insect control has not been successful. In the present study, bio-nano formulation of bimetallic nanoparticles were synthesized using fungal metabolites from Metarhizium anisopliae and tested for insecticidal activity. Metarhizium anisopliae metabolites was synthesized along with bimetallic nanoparticles at different volumes for bioassay studies. Bimetallic nanoparticles showed colour change from light greenish to white. Synthesis of bimetallic NPs was confirmed by UV-vis spectrophotometer, with absorption peak at 387 nm. Functional groups in the synthesized BMNPs were analyzed by FTIR, which showed the presence of functional amines, carboxylic acids, alkenes, alkyl halides, phosphine oxides, anhydrides, phosphines, sulfonates, acid chlorides and alkynes. XRD analysis confirms the crystalline nature of nanoparticles. SEM analysis exhibits, the nanoparticles to be spherical in shape with size ranging 9.50 nm. EDaX analysis confirmed the elemental composition of synthesized NPs, while DLS for size distribution ranging at 80 to 137 nm. The larvicidal activity of monometallic and mycogenic bimetallic nanoparticles were tested on third instar S. frugiperda larvae. The highest mortality was observed in BMNPs at a concentration of 100 μg/ml after 48 h exposure. Pupicidal and antifeedant activity was also observed in the tested BMNPs. Detoxification enzymes studies of BMNPs showed considerable lowering these enzyme which may result in toxic manifestation in the insect. These results strongly suggest that, bimetallic nanoparticles synthesized using M. anisopilae can be used for protecting the crops against S. furgiperda. "
"Abstract: Topical medications are key agents in treating a range of skin conditions, as they allow affected areas to be targeted while avoiding systemic side effects. Although there is a wide range of topical agents available, it is helpful to be familiar with a few commonly used formulations. This article describes how to select appropriate agents, prescribe appropriate quantities, and counsel patients on safe and effective treatment regimens. "
"BACKGROUND: All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is a biologically active isomer of retinoic acid (RA). Topical ATRA (retin-a, retin-a micro, atralin, renova, and avita) is the active pharmaceutical ingredient for FDA-approved treatments for acne and skin wrinkles. Oral formulations (Vesanoid) treat acute promyelocytic leukemia, but oral dosing can induce severe side effects. Despite benefits in various rodent models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), toxicity and controversial clinical observations have diminished enthusiasm for ATRA IBD clinical trials. To circumvent these issues and to use ATRA's key role in maintaining gut tolerance, we developed a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microsphere (MS) encapsulated ATRA formulation aimed at directing ATRA delivery to immune structures of the gut, limiting systemic exposure. Initially, ATRA MS was developed as a component of a combinatorial product (TreXTAM) that also contained encapsulated transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and ATRA in a 1:2 w/w ratio. Although the combination was optimal, benefit was also observed when ATRA MS was given alone in the CD4+ CD25-T-cell adoptive transfer (ACT) colitis model. METHODS: We used the ACT and DSS-induced murine models of colitis to expand on the dose-dependent effects of oral ATRA MS when given alone. The DSS model was also used to compare the efficacy of ATRA MS and soluble ATRA, while healthy animals were used to compare the pharmacokinetics of the two drugs. RESULTS: In both the ACT and DSS-induced murine models of colitis, ATRA MS was observed to be effective in ameliorating disease. ATRA MS was also observed to be more effective than soluble ATRA in these models and displayed more favorable pharmacokinetics. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest ATRA MS, as a standalone product, may attenuate IBD and perhaps limit fibrosis, while limiting systemic side effects. "
"Abstract: The main objective is to evaluate clinical efficacy and safety of using calcipotriol-betamethasone compounding agent for psoriasis treatment through a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), and WanFang Data from inception till July 31, 2020. Efficacy was evaluated based on primary outcome indicators including skin lesion improvement and overall adverse reaction rate. Secondary outcome indicators included degree of life quality improvement, clinical effectiveness rate, and specific adverse reaction rates. RevMan5.3 was used to perform the meta-analysis. 22 studies finally met our inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. The results indicated that for short-term treatment, a sequential therapy that uses calcipotriol betamethasone compounding agent and calcipotriol improves PASI score (MD = -0.94, 95% CI - 1.38 ~ - 0.49, P < 0.0001, I "
"BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory dermatological disorder having complex pathophysiology with autoimmune and genetic factors being the major players. Despite the availability of a gamut of therapeutic strategies, systemic toxicity, poor efficacy, and treatment tolerance due to genetic variability among patients remain the major challenges. This calls for effective intervention with the superior pharmacological profile. Nimbolide (NIM), a major limonoid is an active chemical constituent found in the leaves of the Indian Neem tree, Azadirachta indica. It has gained immense limelight in the past decades for the treatment of various diseases owing to its anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer potentials. OBJECTIVE: The present study was centered around evaluating the anti-psoriatic effect of NIM in the experimental model of Imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like inflammation model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Application of IMQ topically on the dorsum of Balb/c mice from day 0-6 prompted psoriasis-like inflammatory symptoms. Treatment groups included topical administration of NIM incorporated carbopol gel formulation and NIM free drug given through subcutaneous route. Protein expression studies such as immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and ELISA were employed. RESULTS: It was clearly observed from our results that NIM significantly ameliorated the expression of inflammatory and proliferation mediators. Further, NIM in the treatment groups significantly improved classic Psoriasis Area Severity Index scoring when compared to IMQ administered group. CONCLUSION: It is noteworthy that NIM showed a predominant therapeutic effect as compared to other treatment group. To recapitulate, NIM has shown promising activity as an anti-psoriatic agent by remarkably ameliorating inflammation and associated proliferation. "

"BACKGROUND: Melasma is the commonest cause of facial hypermelanosis in skin type IV-VI. First-line treatment includes a triple combination containing topical corticosteroid and hydroquinone which have side effects on prolonged use. Chemical peels are a second-line management option with the laser being used in refractory cases, but the worsening of hyperpigmentation in darker skin types can occur following laser therapy. Sunscreen is a must to prevent relapses. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: (i) To compare the effects of treatment with a proprietary combination (phenyl ethyl resorcinol, nonapeptide-1, aminoethyl phosphinic acid, antioxidants and sunscreen) versus sunscreen alone in limiting or reducing, melasma and preventing recurrence as a maintenance regimen after the initial use of triple combination,(ii) to evaluate the safety of the formulation studied, and (iii) to study the improvement of the quality of life of the patients after using the study formulation versus placebo. METHODS: It was a prospective double-blinded parallel-group randomized controlled pilot study. A total of 46 subjects were recruited by consecutive sampling methods and randomized to 23 each in case and control groups. The study period was eight months with three phases. Phase 1 constituted the application of triple combination for eight weeks by both groups followed by phase 2 with the case group applying proprietary medicine and the control group applying sunscreen. Phase 3 was a follow-up period to see the sustenance of results in both groups as well as any evidence of relapses. Sunscreen was applied in all three phases. RESULTS: Case group in the study showed improvement in the melasma severity score and mean melanin index as measured by mexameter but it did not attain statistical significance as compared to the control group. The melasma area and severity index score showed a consistent reduction in the case group, whereas it increased in the control group from baseline. LIMITATIONS: Small sample size and a short follow-up period of our study were major limitations. CONCLUSION: The proprietary combination, which has sunscreen as one of its constituents, is more effective in maintaining remission after triple combination without any added inconvenience of application of two separate preparations as compared to sunscreen alone.

"Abstract: Sirolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (mTORI) with anti-proliferative, antiangiogenic and immunosuppressive properties. While approved in Australia as an anti-rejection medication for renal transplant patients, there is mounting evidence regarding the utility of oral and topical sirolimus in treating a plethora of dermatological conditions or conditions with cutaneous manifestations. Our aim was to present an overview of the evidence for current usage and breadth of the application of sirolimus in dermatology. We carried out a systematic review of all the literature published up to 31 August 2019 on oral and topical sirolimus with respect to dermatological conditions or conditions otherwise relevant to dermatology. While 3368 papers were initially produced in our search, 238 papers met our inclusion criteria and were examined in our review. The conditions examined were categorised into genodermatoses (9 conditions), infection (1 condition), inflammatory/autoimmune (10 conditions), neoplasm (3 conditions) and vascular (17 conditions). We extracted data on first author, publication year, journal, characteristics of the study and study patients, condition, drug modalities, drug efficacy, side effects, blood level of mTORI, co-interventions and follow-up. While there is level 1 evidence for the efficacy of sirolimus in conditions such as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and GVHD prophylaxis, for many other conditions, the evidence is limited to level 4 evidence. Regarding oral systemic therapy, dosing regimens varied with the most common for children 0.8mg/m "
"Abstract: Image-guided chemo-photothermal therapy based on near-infrared (NIR) theranostic agents has found promising applications in treating tumors. In this multimodal treatment, it is of critical importance to image real-time distribution of photothermal agents in vivo and to monitor therapeutic outcomes for implementing personalized treatment. In this study, an optimally synthesized dextran-polylactide (DEX-PLA) copolymer was assembled with doxorubicin (DOX) and DiR, a kind of NIR dye, to construct desirable micelles ((DiR + DOX)/DEX-PLA) for performing image-guided chemo-photothermal therapy. These (DiR + DOX)/DEX-PLA micelles had good physical and photothermal stability in aqueous media and showed high photothermal efficiency in vivo. Based on the H22-tumor-bearing mouse model, (DiR + DOX)/DEX-PLA micelles were found to accumulate inside tumors sustainably and to emit strong fluorescence signals for more than three days. The (DiR + DOX)@DEX-PLA micelles together with NIR laser irradiation were able to highly inhibit tumor growth or even eradicate tumors with one injection and two dose-designated 5-minute laser irradiations at the tumor site during 14 days of treatment. Furthermore, they showed almost no impairment to the body of the treated mice. These (DiR + DOX)@DEX-PLA micelles have confirmative translational potential in clinical tumor therapy on account of their persistent image-guided capacity, high antitumor efficacy and good in vivo safety.

"Abstract: The treatment of childhood tuberculosis can be challenging due to the lack of pediatric drug formulations and monitoring of drug-toxicity in routine settings. There are no published studies from Uzbekistan on the adverse drug reactions (ADR) associated with anti-tuberculosis treatment in children. In this study, we aimed to investigate the ADR associated with anti-tuberculosis treatment in children. This was a cohort study using secondary program data of children treated at the city and regional tuberculosis clinics in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Of the 302 patients evaluated, 135 (44.7%) reported ADR. New tuberculosis was registered in 277 (92%) patients and 262 (87%) had extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Factors associated with ADR included treatment at a regional hospital (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 1.75;  "
"BACKGROUND: Skin aging is one of the most concerning issues during the post-menopausal period. Despite the promising effects of hormonal therapy, there is still concerned about the long-term outcomes from the treatment. Therefore, nutraceuticals that contain estrogenic and antioxidative effects have gained a lot of attention as an alternative therapy for slowing down skin age-related changes in women after menopause. OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed at evaluating the effects of a combination of nutraceuticals on skin health and antioxidant status in women after menopause. METHODS: Post-menopausal women aged 45-60 years old were enrolled and randomly allocated (n = 110) equally to either treatment or placebo group (n = 55 per group). The test product, a nutraceutical containing a blend of Glycine max, Cimicifuga racemosa, Vitex agnus-castus, and Oenothera biennis extracts, was administered over a 12-week period, with dermatological parameters evaluated at baseline, week 6, and week 12 of the study. Additionally, glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were detected at baseline and week 12 to evaluate the antioxidant status. RESULTS: At week 6, skin roughness was significantly improved in the treatment group (n = 50 completed), while at week 12, a significant improvement and large effect sizes observed in skin elasticity (Cohen's d = 1.56, [SD CONCLUSION: These data indicate the supplementation with the formulated blend of four herbal extracts is supportive of skin health and antioxidant status in women of menopausal age.

"Abstract: Gelatin-based inks have a broad range of applications in bioprinting for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine due to their biocompatibility, ease of modification, degradability, and rapid gelation induced by low temperature. However, gelatin-derived inks prepared through low-temperature treatment have poor mechanical properties that limit their applications. To solve this problem, we designed polyacrylamide/gelatin/silver nanoparticle (PAAm-GelatinAgNPs) ink to improve gelatin-based hydrogels. The ink is based on double networks, in which the physically cross-linked gelatin as the first network and covalently cross-linked PAAm as the second network. It was found that the presence of PAAm increased the tensile and compression strength of the gelatin-based ink. Moreover, silver nanoparticles endowed the antibacterial properties to the gelatin-based ink and were able to shield the UV irradiation and damages to rat skin. In addition, this ink showed the shear thinning property; Consequently it succeeded in printing complex 3D scaffolds such as the cube, five-pointed star, flower, and university logo of ""SEU"". In summary, this ink presents a new strategy for the modification of gelatin and offers new potential applications for customized therapy of antimicrobial and anti-UV damage to tissues. "
"Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been extensively investigated for decades for tumor treatment because of its non-invasiveness, spatiotemporal selectivity, lower side-effects, and immune activation ability. It can be a promising treatment modality in several medical fields, including oncology, immunology, urology, dermatology, ophthalmology, cardiology, pneumology, and dentistry. Nevertheless, the clinical application of PDT is largely restricted by the drawbacks of traditional photosensitizers, limited tissue penetrability of light, inefficient induction of tumor cell death, tumor resistance to the therapy, and the severe pain induced by the therapy. Recently, various photosensitizer formulations and therapy strategies have been developed to overcome these barriers. Significantly, the introduction of nanomaterials in PDT, as carriers or photosensitizers, may overcome the drawbacks of traditional photosensitizers. Based on this, nanocomposites excited by various light sources are applied in the PDT of deep-seated tumors. Modulation of cell death pathways with co-delivered reagents promotes PDT induced tumor cell death. Relief of tumor resistance to PDT with combined therapy strategies further promotes tumor inhibition. Also, the optimization of photosensitizer formulations and therapy procedures reduces pain in PDT. Here, a systematic summary of recent advances in the fabrication of photosensitizers and the design of therapy strategies to overcome barriers in PDT is presented. Several aspects important for the clinical application of PDT in cancer treatment are also discussed. "
"AIM: Retinyl palmitate (RP), the most stable vitamin A derivative, is used to treat photoaging and other skin disorders. The need to minimize the adverse effects of topical drug administration has led to an enhanced interest in loading RP on ethosomes for topical drug delivery. The aim of the current study was to prepare and compare the performance of RP decorated ethosomal hydrogel with tretinoin cream in the treatment of acne vulgaris as an approach to improve drug efficacy and decrease its side effects. METHODS: RP-loaded ethosomes were prepared using the injection sonication technique. A Box-Behnken design using Design Expert RESULTS: The optimized ethosomal RP showed particle size of 195.8±5.45 nm, ZP of -62.1±2.85 mV, EE% of 92.63±4.33%, drug release % of 96.63±6.81%, and drug permeation % of 85.98 ±4.79%. Both the optimized RP ethosomal hydrogel and tretinoin effectively reduced all types of acne lesions (inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total lesions). However, RP resulted in significantly lower non-inflammatory and total acne lesion count than the marketed tretinoin formulation. Besides, RP-loaded ethosomes showed significantly improved tolerability compared to marketed tretinoin with no or minimal skin irritation symptoms. CONCLUSION: RP ethosomal hydrogel is considerably effective in controlling acne vulgaris with excellent skin tolerability. Therefore, it represents an interesting alternative to conventional marketed tretinoin formulation for topical acne treatment. "

"Abstract: As one of the killer diseases in the world, malaria contributes to child mortality and global death annually. As a result, many reactive mechanisms have evolved to control and repel mosquitoes. The use of synthetic mosquito repellents with N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) is one of the popular interventions despite its dermatological limitations such as skin irritations. Ethnobotanical reviews have identified that the adoption of natural repellents promises high repellence on mosquitoes with minimal side effects compared with synthetic ones. However, this has received little attention in modern pharmaceutical literature. This research is focused on the formulation of a natural mosquito repellent from the oil extracted from  "
"AIMS: Skin cancer is the most widespread cancer worldwide, mainly caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV) in sunlight. Utilizing topical preventive agents in routinely daily used cosmetics may prevent UV-related skin damages and skin cancers. γ-Oryzanol (GO) is a natural component derived from rice bran oil, with potential antioxidant and skin anti-aging properties. MAIN METHODS: We biologically thorough studied the antioxidant and anticancer effects of GO in vitro to found the effective signaling pathways, then evaluated the sun protection factor of prepared formulation, and finally investigated the long-term preventive effects of GO-loaded nanoethosomes (GO-NEs) against UVB-induced skin cancer in mice. KEY FINDINGS: GO-NEs could effectively prevent UVB-induced skin cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that GO-NEs could be utilized as an innovative ingredient in cosmetics. "
"Abstract: Here, we demonstrate that the two distinct formulations of our anti-sepsis drug candidate Rejuveinix (RJX), have a very favorable safety profile in Wistar Albino rats at dose levels comparable to the projected clinical dose levels. 14-day treatment with RJX-P (RJX PPP.18.1051) or RJX-B (RJX-B200702-CLN) similarly elevated the day 15 tissue levels of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) as well as ascorbic acid in both the lungs and liver in a dose-dependent fashion. The activity of SOD and ascorbic acid levels were significantly higher in tissues of RJX-P or RJX-B treated rats than vehicle-treated control rats (p < 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference between tissue SOD activity or ascorbic acid levels of rats treated with RJX-P vs. rats treated with RJX-B (p > 0.05). The observed elevations of the SOD and ascorbic acid levels were transient and were no longer detectable on day 28 following a 14-day recovery period. These results demonstrate that RJX-P and RJX-B are bioequivalent relative to their pharmacodynamic effects on tissue SOD and ascorbic acid levels. Furthermore, both formulations showed profound protective activity in a mouse model of sepsis. In agreement with the PD evaluations in rats and their proposed mechanism of action, both RJX-P and RJX-B exhibited near-identical potent and dose-dependent anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activity in the LPS-GalN model of ARDS and multi-organ failure in mice.

"Abstract: Gestational trophoblastic tumors seriously endanger child productive needs and the health of women in childbearing age. Nanodrug-based therapy mediated by transporters provides a novel strategy for the treatment of trophoblastic tumors. Focusing on the overexpression of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) on the membrane of choriocarcinoma cells (JEG-3), cytarabine (Cy, a substrate of ENT1)-grafted liposomes (Cy-Lipo) were introduced for the targeted delivery of methotrexate (Cy-Lipo@MTX) for choriocarcinoma therapy in this study. ENT1 has a high affinity for Cy-Lipo and can mediate the endocytosis of the designed nanovehicles into JEG-3 cells. The ENT1 protein maintains its transportation function through circulation and regeneration during endocytosis. Therefore, Cy-Lipo-based formulations showed high tumor accumulation and retention in biodistribution studies. More importantly, the designed DSPE-PEG "
"Abstract: Ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC) (CAS number: 5466-77-3) and butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (BMDM) (CAS number: 70356-09-1) are important sunscreens. However, frequent application of large amounts of these compounds may reflect serious environmental impact, once it enters the environment through indirect release via wastewater treatment or immediate release during water activities. In this article, we reviewed the toxicological effects of EHMC and BMDM on aquatic ecosystems and the human consequences. According to the literature, EHMC and BMDM have been detected in water samples and sediments worldwide. Consequently, these compounds are also present in several marine organisms like fish, invertebrates, coral reefs, marine mammals, and other species, due to its bioaccumulation potential. Studies show that these chemicals are capable of damaging the aquatic beings in different ways. Further, bioaccumulation studies have shown that EHMC biomagnifies through trophic levels, which makes human seafood consumption a concern because the higher position in the trophic chain, the more elevate levels of ultraviolet (UV) filters are detected, and it is established that EHMC present adverse effects on the human organism. In contrast, there are no studies on the BMDM bioaccumulation and biomagnification potential. Different strategies can be adopted to avoid the damage caused by sunscreens in the environment and human organism. Two of them include the use of natural photoprotectors, such as polyphenols, in association with UV filters in sunscreens and the development of new and safer UV filters. Overall, this review shows the importance of studying the impacts of sunscreens in nature and developing safer sunscreens and formulations to safeguard marine fauna, ecosystems, and humans. "
"BACKGROUND: Two identical phase 3 trials (NCT03168321 and NCT03168334) and pooled post hoc analyses have established efficacy and safety of a polymeric tazarotene 0.045% lotion formulation in patients with moderate-to-severe acne. Presented here are post hoc analyses that further examine efficacy and safety of tazarotene 0.045% lotion by age and sex. METHODS: Patients aged ≥ 9 years with moderate-to-severe acne (score 3 or 4 on the Evaluator's Global Severity Score [EGSS]) were equally randomized to once-daily tazarotene 0.045% lotion or vehicle lotion for 12 weeks. Efficacy outcomes included inflammatory/noninflammatory lesion counts and treatment success (proportion of participants achieving ≥ 2-grade reduction from baseline in EGSS and score of 0 [clear] or 1 [almost clear]). Adolescent and adult females (n=1,013) and males (n=529) were subdivided into 3 age groups: 13–19, 20–29, and ≥30 years. RESULTS: At week 12, large least-squares mean percent reductions in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions were observed across all 3 tazarotene-treated age groups in males and females (range, -50.2% to -64.8%). Treatment success rates ranged from 23.6% to 38.4%. Across all efficacy assessments, significant differences between tazarotene and vehicle (P<0.05) were generally observed in the younger male and female participants (13–19 and 20–29). No notable age-related patterns were found for safety outcomes, though tazarotene-treated males of all age groups reported fewer adverse events than females. CONCLUSIONS: Tazarotene 0.045% lotion is efficacious and well tolerated in female and male adolescents and adults with moderate-to-severe acne. J Drugs Dermatol. 2021;20(6):608-615. doi:10.36849/JDD.6070. "
"Abstract: Background Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a deadly disease characterized by vascular stiffness and altered cellular metabolism. Current treatments focus on vasodilation and not other root causes of pathogenesis. Previously, it was demonstrated that glutamine metabolism, as catalyzed by GLS1 (glutaminase 1) activity, is mechanoactivated by matrix stiffening and the transcriptional coactivators YAP1 (yes-associated protein 1) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), resulting in pulmonary vascular proliferation and PH. Pharmacologic inhibition of YAP1 (by verteporfin) or glutaminase (by CB-839) improved PH in vivo. However, systemic delivery of these agents, particularly YAP1 inhibitors, may have adverse chronic effects. Furthermore, simultaneous use of pharmacologic blockers may offer additive or synergistic benefits. Therefore, a strategy that delivers these drugs in combination to local lung tissue, thus avoiding systemic toxicity and driving more robust improvement, was investigated. Methods and Results We used poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid polymer-based microparticles for delivery of verteporfin and CB-839 simultaneously to the lungs of rats suffering from monocrotaline-induced PH. Microparticles released these drugs in a sustained fashion and delivered their payload in the lungs for 7 days. When given orotracheally to the rats weekly for 3 weeks, microparticles carrying this drug combination improved hemodynamic (right ventricular systolic pressure and right ventricle/left ventricle+septum mass ratio), histologic (vascular remodeling), and molecular markers (vascular proliferation and stiffening) of PH. Importantly, only the combination of drug delivery, but neither verteporfin nor CB-839 alone, displayed significant improvement across all indexes of PH. Conclusions Simultaneous, lung-specific, and controlled release of drugs targeting YAP1 and GLS1 improved PH in rats, addressing unmet needs for the treatment of this deadly disease. "
"OBJECTIVES: The chief objective of the present research was to reduce local side effects by reducing the dose, controlling the release, and improving the stability by developing and optimizing tretinoin (TRT)-loaded topical emulgel formulation. METHODS: TRT emulgel (TE) was prepared and optimized at varying ratios of excipients and using 3 RESULTS: The FTIR and DSC analysis revealed the compatibility between TRT and formulation excipients of emulgel. The batch F5 of emulgel formulation displayed maximum drug content (98.69±1.26%), and controlled TRT release (78.27±0.69%). Thus, batch F5 was selected as an optimized batch for further characterization. The photomicroscopic analysis of optimized TE exhibited the presence of spherical globules. The pH and viscosity of optimized TE were found to be 6.20±0.12 and 3240cP respectively. Besides, the optimized TE showed good spreadability and extrudability. The in vitro anti-acne activity against Propionibacterium acne (P. acne) of optimized TE (diameter of zone of inhibition 34.54±0.26mm) was found to be the comparatively same as that of marketed Sotret® gel (diameter of zone of inhibition 36.13±0.43mm). Moreover, no sign of irritation was observed in rats treated with optimized TE indicating the safety of TE. Furthermore, the optimized TE displayed significant (p<0.01) in vivo anti-inflammatory activity when compared to marketed gel. Besides, optimized TE was found to be stable when stored in cool conditions for three months. CONCLUSION: Thus, the emulgel could be a promising approach for the topical delivery of TRT with improved performance and reduced side effects. "
"BACKGROUND: An increasing number of studies have investigated the adverse effect profile of oral cannabinoids; however, few studies have provided sufficient data on the tolerability of topical cannabinoids in human participants. AIM: To assess the tolerability profile of several commercial topical formulations containing cannabidiol (CBD) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) on the skin of healthy human participants. METHODS: Three human clinical trials and one in vitro study were conducted. The potential for skin irritation, sensitization and phototoxicity of several products, were assessed via patch testing on healthy human skin. The products assessed included two formulations containing CBD and PEA, one containing hemp seed oil and four concentrations of CBD alone. Ocular toxicity was tested using a traditional hen's egg chorioallantoic membrane model with three CBD, PEA and hemp seed oil formulations. RESULTS: There was no irritation or sensitization of the products evident via patch testing on healthy participants. Additionally, mild phototoxicity of a hemp seed oil product was found at the 48-h time point compared with the negative control. The in vitro experiment demonstrated comparable effects of cannabinoid products with historically nonirritating products. CONCLUSION: These specific formulations of CBD- and PEA-containing products are nonirritating and nonsensitizing in healthy adults, and further encourage similar research assessing their long-term safety and efficacy in human participants with dermatological diseases. There are some limitations to the study: (i) external validity may be limited as formulations from a single manufacturer were used for this study, while vast heterogeneity exists across unregulated, commercial CBD products on the market; and (ii) products were assessed only on normal, nondiseased human skin, and therefore extrapolation to those with dermatological diseases cannot be assumed.

"Abstract: Recent legislative measures restricting the sale of sunscreens containing certain ultraviolet light filtering ingredients (UVFs) have been based on a perception of risk to aquatic life despite the lack of a robust data set to support these decisions. Concerns were focused on the potential for recreational swimmers' and divers' sunscreen use to result in exposures to coral already stressed due to climate change, disease, and other local conditions. In published environmental risk assessments for UVFs, exposure estimates were based on episodic environmental monitoring or estimates of typical sunscreen use, arbitrarily assuming the portion rinsed off from skin in seawater. To improve the accuracy of exposure estimates and thereby develop more robust risk assessments, we measured the amount of the UVFs, avobenzone, homosalate, octisalate, octocrylene, and oxybenzone released to seawater from four sunscreen products (two lotions, one spray, one stick) in a novel porcine skin model of typical human sunscreen use. Sunscreen was applied to porcine skin, allowed to briefly dry, then exposed to four rinse cycles in artificial seawater. The mass of each UVF in seawater, partitioned from seawater onto glassware, and extractable from skin after rinsing were determined. The proportion rinsed from skin varied by UVF, by formula type, and by application rate. Less than 1.4% of applied octisalate, homosalate, and octocrylene was detected in seawater samples (independent of formula) increasing to an average of 4% and 8% for avobenzone in stick and lotion forms, and to 24% for oxybenzone in lotions. The initial data show substantial differences in rinse-off among formulation types and sunscreen application rates, and stress the importance of using UVF-specific rinse-off values rather than a single value for all UVFs. This new method provides a tool for more robust exposure estimates, with initial data supporting lower rinse-off values than adopted in published risk assessments.

"Abstract: Hyperpigmentation of the skin refers to a dermatological condition which alters the color of the skin, making it discolored or darkened. The treatments for hyperpigmentation disorders often take very long to show results and have poor patient compliance. The first-line treatment for hyperpigmentation involves topical formulations of conventional agents such as hydroquinone, kojic acid, and glycolic acid followed by oral formulations of therapeutic agents such as tranexamic acid, melatonin, and cysteamine hydrochloride. The second-line approaches include chemical peels and laser therapy given under the observation of expert professionals. However, these therapies pose certain limitations and adverse effects such as erythema, skin peeling, and drying and require long treatment duration to show visible effects. These shortcomings of the conventional treatments provided scope for further research on newer alternatives for managing hyperpigmentation. Some of these therapies include novel formulations such as solid lipid nanocarriers, liposomes, phytochemicals, platelet-rich plasma, microneedling. This review focuses on elaborating on several hyperpigmentation disorders and their mechanisms, the current, novel and emerging treatment options for management of hyperpigmentation. "
"Abstract: Since its approval in 1982, oral isotretinoin has revolutionized acne therapy. However, oral isotretinoin use has long been associated with challenges of variable bioavailability and food dependence. It is recommended to ingest oral isotretinoin with a high-fat meal in order to maximize absorption, but many patients fail to adhere to this recommendation. This may lead to inadequate isotretinoin absorption levels. Patients who fail to achieve isotretinoin target cumulative dose are more likely to experience symptom relapse. To address the challenge of traditional isotretinoin variable bioavailability, subsequent isotretinoin formulations have attempted to improve its absorption abilities. In 2014, an isotretinoin formulation utilizing Lidose technology, known as Absorica, showed significant improvements in absorption levels compared to traditional oral isotretinoin in the fasted state. In 2019, isotretinoin absorption levels were further advanced in a new formulation approved by the FDA known as Absorica LD. Utilizing advanced micronization technology that physically reduces the size of the drug molecule, Absorica LD exhibits twice the absorption levels of Absorica under fasting conditions. In the fed state, Absorica LD achieves similar plasma levels to Absorica with a 20 percent lower dose. Absorica LD also produces consistent serum isotretinoin levels irrespective of gastrointestinal contents. By eliminating the &ldquo;food effect&rdquo; seen in traditional oral isotretinoin, Absorica LD has the potential to improve patient adherence and long-term patient outcomes.

"BACKGROUND: Topical azelaic acid (AzA) is a common treatment for mild/moderate inflammatory rosacea. AIMS: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of a novel formulation cream containing 15% AzA (anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidant/anti-microbial agent) combined with 1% dihydroavenanthramide D (anti-inflammatory/anti-itch) in inflammatory rosacea using clinical/instrumental evaluation. METHODS: In this multicentre, prospective, open-label trial, 45 patients with mild/moderate inflammatory rosacea enrolled at the Dermatology Clinic of the University of Catania, Naples, and Rome (Italy) were instructed to apply the cream twice daily for 8 weeks. Clinical evaluation was performed at baseline (T0) and at 8 weeks (T1) by (1) Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score based on a 5-point scale (from 0 = clear/no erythema/papules/pustules to 4 = severe erythema/several papules/pustules) and (2) inflammatory lesions count. Instrumental evaluation of erythema degree was performed by erythema-directed digital photography (EDDP) by a 5-point scale (from 0 = no redness to 4 = severe redness) at all time points. Tolerability was assessed by a self-administered questionnaire at 8 weeks. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 9. RESULTS: Forty-four patients completed the study. At week 8, a significant decrease in baseline of IGA scores [median from 3 (T0) to 1 (T1)] and inflammatory lesions count [median from 8 (T0) to 1 (T1)] was recorded along with a significant reduction of erythema scores [median from 2 (T0) to 1 (T1)]. No relevant side effects were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that this new non-irritating product represents a valid therapeutic option for mild/moderate inflammatory rosacea, and EDDP is able to provide a more defined evaluation of erythema changes.

"Abstract: Since the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tretinoin in 1971, retinoids alone or combined with other agents have become the mainstay of acne treatment. Retinoids act through binding to retinoic acid receptors, altering expression levels of hundreds of cellular proteins affecting multiple pathways involved in acne pathogenesis. Retinoids have evolved from first-generation agents, such as tretinoin, through chemical modifications resulting in a second generation (etretinate and acitretin for psoriasis), a third generation (adapalene and tazarotene) and, most recently, a fourth (trifarotene). For all topical retinoids, local irritation has been associated with poor tolerability and suboptimal adherence. Efforts to improve tolerability have utilized novel delivery systems and/or novel agents. This qualitative literature review summarizes the evolution of the four topical single-agent retinoids available for the treatment of acne in the US today and their various formulations, presenting the rationale behind their development and data from key studies.

"Abstract: The human skin, particularly the stratum corneum, serves as a protective barrier against exogenous factors, including ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and pathogen invasions. The impact of UVR on skin cancer and photoaging has been extensively studied. However, the direct impact of UVR on skin barrier integrity under clinical settings remains poorly explored. Due to their benefits in reducing inflammation and promoting skin barrier repair, ceramide-containing formulations can provide added photoprotection benefits. In this study, the efficacy of a ceramide-containing sunscreen and moisturizer were evaluated in preventing UV-induced skin surface barrier changes. Expert grading, instrumental, and tape-stripping assessments demonstrated that UVR induced erythema and hyperpigmentation and caused changes in skin cells surface morphological organization and maturation. Treatment with a ceramide-containing sunscreen and moisturizing cream routine reduced erythema and hyperpigmentation, improved skin hydration, and maintained normal superficial skin cells morphology and turnover after UVR. Our results indicate that barrier-enforcing lipids formulations can provide additional benefits in patient&rsquo;s daily routine by strengthening the barrier and improving skin health overall against chronic sun exposure.

"Abstract: The skin barrier is a multifaceted microenvironment, comprised not only of structural and molecular components that maintain its integrity, but also a lipid matrix comprising an equimolar ratio of cholesterol, free fatty acids, and ceramides. Lipid abnormalities induced by environmental or pathological stimuli are often associated with impaired skin barrier function and integrity. Incorporation of skin lipids in skincare formulations to help fortify barrier function has become widespread. While there are resources available to study the barrier, a comprehensive evaluation of skin models, from in situ to in vivo, that focus on alterations of the lipid content, seems to be lacking. This article reviews current methods to evaluate the skin lipid barrier and touches upon the significance of using such models within the cosmetic field to study formulations that incorporate barrier lipids.

"BACKGROUND: Asthma is characterised by chronic inflammation of the airways and recurrent exacerbations with wheezing, chest tightness, and cough. Treatment with inhaled steroids and bronchodilators can result in good control of symptoms, prevention of further morbidity, and improved quality of life. However, an increase in serious adverse events with the use of both regular formoterol and regular salmeterol (long-acting beta₂-agonists) compared with placebo for chronic asthma has been demonstrated in previous Cochrane Reviews. This increase was statistically significant in trials that did not randomise participants to an inhaled corticosteroid, but not when formoterol or salmeterol was combined with an inhaled corticosteroid. The confidence intervals were found to be too wide to ensure that the addition of an inhaled corticosteroid renders regular long-acting beta₂-agonists completely safe; few participants and insufficient serious adverse events in these trials precluded a definitive decision about the safety of combination treatments. OBJECTIVES: To assess risks of mortality and non-fatal serious adverse events in trials that have randomised patients with chronic asthma to regular formoterol and an inhaled corticosteroid versus regular salmeterol and an inhaled corticosteroid. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Airways Register of Trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registries to identify reports of randomised trials for inclusion. We checked manufacturers' websites and clinical trial registers for unpublished trial data, as well as Food and Drug Administration (FDA) submissions in relation to formoterol and salmeterol. The date of the most recent search was  24 February 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included controlled clinical trials with a parallel design, recruiting patients of any age and severity of asthma, if they randomised patients to treatment with regular formoterol versus regular salmeterol (each with a randomised inhaled corticosteroid) and were of at least 12 weeks' duration. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion in the review, extracted outcome data from published papers and trial registries, and applied GRADE rating for the results. We sought unpublished data on mortality and serious adverse events from study sponsors and authors. The primary outcomes were all cause mortality and non-fatal serious adverse events. We chose not to calculate an average result from all the formulations of formoterol and inhaled steroid, as the doses and delivery devices are too diverse to assume a single class effect. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-one studies in 11,572 adults and adolescents and two studies in 723 children met the eligibility criteria of the review. No data were available for two studies; therefore these were not included in the analysis. Among adult and adolescent studies, seven compared formoterol and budesonide to salmeterol and fluticasone (N = 7764), six compared formoterol and beclomethasone to salmeterol and fluticasone (N = 1923), two compared formoterol and mometasone to salmeterol and fluticasone (N = 1126), two compared formoterol and fluticasone to salmeterol and fluticasone (N = 790), and one compared formoterol and budesonide to salmeterol and budesonide (N = 229). In total, five deaths were reported among adults, none of which was thought to be related to asthma. The certainty of evidence for all-cause mortality was low, as there were not enough deaths to permit any precise conclusions regarding the risk of mortality on combination formoterol versus combination salmeterol. In all, 201 adults reported non-fatal serious adverse events. In studies comparing formoterol and budesonide to salmeterol and fluticasone, there were 77 in the formoterol arm and 68 in the salmeterol arm (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.59; 5935 participants, 7 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). In the formoterol and beclomethasone studies, there were 12 adults in the formoterol arm and 13 in the salmeterol arm with events (Peto OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.08; 1941 participants, 6 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). In the formoterol and mometasone studies, there were 18 in the formoterol arm and 11 in the salmeterol arm (Peto OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.20; 1126 participants, 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). One adult in the formoterol and fluticasone studies in the salmeterol arm experienced an event (Peto OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 3.10; 293 participants, 2 studies; low-certainty evidence). Another adult in the formoterol and budesonide compared to salmeterol and budesonide study in the formoterol arm had an event (Peto OR 7.45, 95% CI 0.15 to 375.68; 229 participants, 1 study; low-certainty evidence). Only 46 adults were reported to have experienced asthma-related serious adverse events. The certainty of the evidence was low to very low due to the small number of events and the absence of independent assessment of causation. The two studies in children compared formoterol and fluticasone to salmeterol and fluticasone. No deaths and no asthma-related serious adverse events were reported in these studies. Four all-cause serious adverse events were reported: three in the formoterol arm, and one in the salmeterol arm (Peto OR 2.72, 95% CI 0.38 to 19.46; 548 participants, 2 studies; low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, for both adults and children, evidence is insufficient to show whether regular formoterol in combination with budesonide, beclomethasone, fluticasone, or mometasone has a different safety profile from salmeterol in combination with fluticasone or budesonide. Five deaths of any cause were reported across all studies and no deaths from asthma; this information is insufficient to permit any firm conclusions about the relative risks of mortality on combination formoterol in comparison to combination salmeterol inhalers. Evidence on all-cause non-fatal serious adverse events indicates that there is probably little to no difference between formoterol/budesonide and salmeterol/fluticasone inhalers. However events for the other formoterol combination inhalers were too few to allow conclusions. Only 46 non-fatal serious adverse events were thought to be asthma related; this small number in addition to the absence of independent outcome assessment means that we have very low confidence for this outcome. We found no evidence of safety issues that would affect the choice between salmeterol and formoterol combination inhalers used for regular maintenance therapy by adults and children with asthma. "
"BACKGROUND: A variety of dermatoses have been reported in the growing number of patients treated with immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), but the current understanding of cutaneous immune-related adverse events (irAEs) is limited. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cumulative incidence, distribution, and risk factors of cutaneous irAEs after ICI initiation. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients in a national insurance claims database including cancer patients treated with ICIs and matched controls. RESULTS: The study included 8637 ICI patients and 8637 matched controls. The overall incidence of cutaneous irAEs was 25.1%, with a median onset time of 113 days. The ICI group had a significantly higher incidence of pruritus, mucositis, erythroderma, maculopapular eruption, vitiligo, lichen planus, bullous pemphigoid, Grover disease, rash, other nonspecific eruptions, and drug eruption or other nonspecific drug reaction. Patients with melanoma and renal cell carcinoma and those receiving combination therapy were at a higher risk of cutaneous irAEs. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective design without access to patient chart data. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies cutaneous irAEs in a real-world clinical setting and highlights patient groups that are particularly at risk. The results can aid dermatologists at the bedside in the diagnosis of cutaneous irAEs and in formulating management recommendations to referring oncologists regarding the continuation of ICI therapy.

"Abstract: Unprotected exposure of skin to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) may damage the DNA of skin cells and can lead to skin cancer. Sunscreens are topical formulations used to protect skin against UVR. The active ingredients of sunscreens are UV filters that absorb, scatter, and/or reflect UVR. Preventing the formation of free radicals and repairing DNA damages, natural antioxidants are also added to sunscreens as a second fold of protection against UVR. Antioxidants can help stabilise these formulations during the manufacturing process and upon application on skin. However, UV filters and antioxidants are both susceptible to degradation upon exposure to sunlight and oxygen. Additionally, due to their poor water solubility, natural antioxidants are challenging to formulate and exhibit limited penetration and bioavailability in the site of action (i.e., deeper skin layers). Cyclodextrins (CDs) are cyclic oligosaccharides that are capable of forming inclusion complexes with poorly soluble drugs, such as antioxidants. In this review, we discuss the use of CDs inclusion complexes to enhance the aqueous solubility of antioxidants and chemical UV filters and provide a protective shield against degradative factors. The role of CDs in providing a controlled drug release profile from sunscreens is also discussed. Finally, incorporating CDs inclusion complexes into sunscreens has the potential to increase their efficiency and hence improve their skin cancer prevention. "
"Abstract: Chronic neuropathic pain, particularly peripheral pain, is a cause of great concern for diabetic patients. Current treatments include numerous agents such as capsaicinoids, a known deterrent of neuropathic pain despite the inconvenience associated with local side effects. In this context, the current work aims to elucidate the potential mechanisms involved in cytotoxicity by capsaicin and proposes an efficient formulation of capsaicin in alginate microcapsules, which significantly reduces side effects from capsaicin topical administration. For this, human dermal fibroblast cells were treated with alginate-microencapsulated capsaicin extracts and screened for potential cytotoxic effects produced by the treatment. Cell viability and morphology were examined, as well as oxidative stress status and anti-inflammatory potential. Our results show that the alginate encapsulated formulation of capsaicin exerted lower cytotoxic effects on human dermal fibroblasts as measured by cell viability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, the expression profiles of inflammatory cytokines were significantly altered by the treatment as compared with the control culture. "
"Abstract: Increasing evidence on the impact of the different wavelengths of sunlight on the skin demonstrates the need for tailored recommendations of sunscreen according to skin phototype and dermatoses, which is now possible due to advances in the filters and formulations of sunscreens. A selective literature search was performed by an international expert panel, focusing on the type of sunscreen to recommend for photoaging, skin cancers, photodermatoses, pigmentary disorders and skin inflammatory disorders. Protection against ultraviolet (UV)B is especially important for light skin as there is a high risk of sunburn, DNA damage and skin cancers. Darker skin may be naturally better protected against UVB but is more prone to hyperpigmentation induced by visible light (VL) and UVA. Protection against UVA, VL and infrared A can be helpful for all skin phototypes as they penetrate deeply and cause photoaging. Long-wave UVA1 plays a critical role in pigmentation, photoaging, skin cancer, DNA damage and photodermatoses. Adapting the formulation and texture of the sunscreen to the type of skin and dermatoses is also essential. Practical recommendations on the type of sunscreen to prescribe are provided to support the clinician in daily practice. "

"Abstract: Acne vulgaris is the most common dermatological disorder worldwide, causing significant physical and psychological morbidity. Topical combination therapy has shown superior efficacy compared to monotherapy, especially when combined with retinoids. Few studies have directly compared combined formulations. This evaluator-blinded pilot study compared the efficacy and tolerability of two marketed topical combination acne gels, clindamycin 1%-tretinoin 0.025% (CT) and benzoyl peroxide 2.5%-adapalene 0.1% (BA) in 20 patients with mild to moderate acne vulgaris. Gels were applied daily on opposite sides of the face for 21 days. The primary outcome was difference in transepidermal water loss (TEWL) at the end of treatment. Secondary endpoints were skin moisture content measurement, Investigators' Global Assessment, subject self-assessments (SSA) of burning/stinging, itching, erythema, and dryness/scaling, and Comparative Participant Satisfaction Questionnaire (CPSQ). Efficacy was assessed by inflammatory and non- inflammatory acne efflorescences counts. TEWL increased significantly for both CT and BA (+57.74%, P=0.002; +58.77%, P&lt;0.001); skin moisture content significantly decreased only for BA (-16.47%, P=0.02). Only BA showed a significant increase in erythema and dryness/scaling (P=0.027 and P=0.014) and in SSA burning/stinging (P=0.04). Patient satisfaction evaluation also reflected the strong BA irritation. Although CT and BA both reduced acne lesions (P&lt;0.001) and more patients preferred to continue with CT, subject perception of acne improvement was higher for BA. These findings suggest that CT and BA have similar efficacy in the treatment of mild to moderate papulopustular acne. However, CT was better tolerated than BA by both medical and subject evaluation. CT is an effective and tolerated treatment option.J Drugs Dermatol. 2021;20(3):295-301. doi:10.36849/JDD.2021.5641. "
"Abstract: 3-hydroxytyrosol (HT) is the main phenolic compound found in olive oil with known antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties in several dermatological conditions, both when taken in the form of olive oil or pure in cosmeceutical formulations. To date, its direct effect on the wound healing process and the molecular mechanisms involved have not yet been elucidated. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to explore its effects in vitro in epidermal keratinocyte cultures focusing on the molecular mechanism implied. HT was able to induce keratinocyte proliferation in the low micromolar range, increasing the expression of cyclin dependent kinases fundamental for cell cycle progression such as CDK2 and CDK6. Furthermore, it increased cell migration through the activation of tissue remodeling factors such as matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) protein. Then, we evaluated whether HT also showed antioxidant activity at this concentration range, protecting from H "
"Abstract: Corneal cross-linking has been described as an effective treatment to slow the progression of keratoconus. The standard protocol entails corneal epithelial removal to allow the diffusion of riboflavin into the stroma. Although, de-epithelization can generate risks or complications that transepithelial cross-linking tries to solve or avoid. Different formulations were developed after verifying that hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) and sulfobuthylether-β-cyclodextrin (SBEβCD) in a 20% concentration, increased the solubility of practically insoluble in water drugs such as riboflavin from 0.12 mg/mL to 0.35 mg/mL and 0.29 mg/mL respectively. These values were higher when chitosan and arginine were added to the formulation, showing solubility of 0.78 mg/mL when HPβCD concentration was not modified. Ex vivo corneal permeability was measured after having kept in contact bovine corneas with intact epithelium for 5 h with the 0.1 mg/mL riboflavin solution, the formulations developed and a reproduced nanoemulsion from another work. Riboflavin's permeability was increased when cyclodextrins, chitosan, and arginine were part of the formulations, compared to the control drug solution. The best permeability coefficient was reached when riboflavin was combined with 40% (w/v) HPβCD, 0.5% (w/w) arginine, and 0.5% (w/w) chitosan. After having carried out toxicity studies as bovine corneal opacity and permeability (BCOP) and Heńs Egg Test - Chorioallantoic Membrane Test (HET-CAM) it was verified that both, the active ingredients and the excipients of the different formulations were not harmful without generating irritation, loss of transparency or corneal permeability alterations. The results show the great potential of the ocular developed solution for their use in transepithelial cross-linking for keratoconus treatment. "
"Abstract: Acne is a chronic dermatological disease of pilosebaceous units existing in the form of hair follicles (HFs) and accompanying sebaceous glands. In topical acne treatment, localisation of drug substance at the target site, in pilosebaceous units, especially in HFs is essential. The aims of this study were to develop and optimise adapalene (ADA)-loaded PAMAM dendrimer-based nanocarriers for topical acne treatment and to prepare gel formulations of the selected nanocarriers and to characterise their rheological properties and spreadability. ADA accumulation in HFs and in the skin from PAMAM dendrimers' aqueous colloidal formulations and their gel formulations were quantitatively determined using punch biopsy technique. Follicular targeting efficiency from PAMAM dendrimers and their gel formulation was compared with the commercial gel product, Differin "
"BACKGROUND: Pathophysiology of rosacea is not completely understood and involves a complex interaction among genetics, ultraviolet (UV) light, microorganisms, impaired skin barrier, neuronal and vascular dysfunction, and immune system disruption. AIMS: To describe the etiology of rosacea with an emphasis on the role of UV radiation and exposome, and to review the importance of non-pharmacologic strategies focusing on photoprotection. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review of the literature. We performed literature searches with PubMed from January 1990 to November 2020 using the keywords ""rosacea"", ""pathogenesis"", ""ultraviolet radiation"", ""exposome"", ""photoprotection"", ""sunscreens"" and ""non-pharmacologic agents"". The search was limited to English, Spanish, and French language articles. RESULTS: Several environmental factors such as UV light, diverse microorganisms, air pollution, tobacco smoking, nutrition, and psychological stress showed to trigger or worsen rosacea. UV radiation was reported to induce pro-inflammatory, pro-angiogenic, and pro-fibrotic responses. We found 6 original articles about the impact of sunscreens on rosacea. The use of sunscreens containing ingredients with emollient, anti-inflammatory, and/or vasoregulatory properties was shown to significantly improve symptomatology. CONCLUSION: UV radiation and the exposome play a key role in the development of rosacea. UV light is implicated in all significant aspects of rosacea: skin inflammation, neoangiogenesis, telangiectasia, and fibrosis, and may even initiate rosacea. While the use of sunscreens is widely recommended, the literature on the impact of photoprotection in rosacea is scarce. Adequately formulated sunscreens could not only provide the required level of photoprotection, but may also help to mitigate the barrier dysfunction, neutralize facial redness (tinted sunscreens), and decrease inflammation and vascular dysfunction.

"Abstract: A challenge for cosmetic and dermatologic products is to develop new high-performance and safer anti-aging products based on new compounds to enhance the stability of retinyl palmitate combined with broad-spectrum UV-filters. Consequently, the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of three often used avobenzone photostabilizers-ethylhexyl methoxycrylene (EHMCR), tris(tetramethylhydroxypiperidinol) citrate (TTMHP) and tris-biphenyl triazine (TBPT)-on the photostability and phototoxicity of the combination of avobenzone (AVO), octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC) and retinyl palmitate (RP). The photostability studies were performed by the exposure of formulations to UVA radiation. The phototoxicity was evaluated by the 3T3 neutral red uptake phototoxic assay (OECD TG 432). The addition of EHMCR, TBPT, and TTMHP in the formulations, with/or without RP, improved the photostability of AVO and RP, but EHMCR was the most effective in stabilizing RP. In the phototoxicity assay, the combinations AVO-OMC containing or not RP showed phototoxic potential. EHMCR and TTMHP reduced the phototoxicity of the combination AVO-OMC, whereas EHMCR also decreased the phototoxicity of the combination containing RP. Therefore, EHMCR might be used to the photostabilization of formulations of AVO-OMC with/or not RP, while TTMHP can be added to this photounstable UV-filter combination. "
"Abstract: Topical therapy is the mainstay of treatment for the majority of patients with psoriasis vulgaris (chronic plaque psoriasis), with combinations of vitamin D analogues and glucocorticoids having been shown to negate many of the negative effects associated with either monocomponent individually. Following the established efficacy of fixed-dose combination calcipotriol (Cal; 50 µg/g) plus betamethasone dipropionate (BD; 0.5 mg/g) ointment and gel formulations, a novel Cal/BD foam formulation was developed. When applied, Cal/BD foam forms a supersaturated solution on the skin, increasing the penetration and bioavailability of Cal and BD. Early data indicate that this results in improved efficacy outcomes versus Cal/BD ointment, without negatively affecting safety outcomes (such as the incidence/severity of side effects or impacted calcium homeostasis or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis). This article discusses the potency and absorption of fixed-dose combination Cal/BD foam, as well as the positive early efficacy and safety data associated with its utilisation in the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris.

"Abstract: The fixed-dose combination calcipotriol (Cal; 50 µg/g) plus betamethasone dipropionate (BD; 0.5 mg/g) ointment and gel formulations have well-established efficacy profiles in the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris (chronic plaque psoriasis); this combination has been shown to produce favourable outcomes versus either monotherapy. To improve upon the efficacy and cosmetic acceptability of these treatments Cal/BD foam was developed, demonstrating superior efficacy in Phase II/III studies compared with either of its monocomponents, Cal/BD ointment, Cal/BD gel and various other therapies for the treatment of psoriasis. Multiple outcome measures were evaluated in the clinical studies, including physician's global assessment of disease severity and modified psoriasis area and severity index. Of note, 38-55% of patients across studies achieved a physician's global assessment of 'clear' or 'almost clear' after 4 weeks of Cal/BD treatment. This superior efficacy was not associated with an increased frequency or severity of adverse events, and there was no evidence for dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis or calcium homeostasis. Overall, Cal/BD foam was efficacious, with a good tolerability profile consistent with established Cal/BD formulations. "
"Abstract: Primary Sjögren's syndrome (SjS) is a systemic autoimmune disease most commonly diagnosed in middle-aged women. Although the disease can occur at all ages, it is diagnosed between 30 and 60 years of age in two-thirds of patients. In more than 20% of cases, the people are older than 65 years. In this review, we focus on the therapeutic management of primary SjS in older patients, following the recently published 2020 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the management of the disease with topical and systemic therapies. These recommendations are applicable to all patients with primary SjS regardless of age at diagnosis, although the therapeutic management in older patients requires additional considerations. Older patients are more likely to have pulmonary, liver, kidney, or heart-related comorbidities (even cognitive disturbances); caution is required when most drugs are used, including muscarinic agents, systemic corticosteroids and synthetic immunosuppressants. It is also important to monitor the use of eye drops containing steroids due to the increased risk of developing cataracts, a frequent ocular complication in the older population. In contrast, the majority of drugs that can be used topically (pilocarpine rinses, eye drops containing topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or cyclosporine A, topical dermal formulations of NSAIDs) have shown an acceptable safety profile in older patients, as well as rituximab. A rigorous evaluation of the medical history of older patients is essential when drugs included in the EULAR guidelines are prescribed, with special attention to factors frequently related to ageing, such as polypharmacy, the existence of organ-specific comorbidities, or the enhanced susceptibility to infections.

"Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) have been used in China for thousands of years. Although TCM has been generally perceived to be safe, adverse reactions to Chinese materia medica (CMM) have been reported. Most of the adverse reactions are allergic in nature, but other mechanisms may play a role. This review focuses on the mechanism and clinical presentation of these allergic reactions. Allergic reactions can occur as a result of the active and inactive ingredients of CMM. Impurities and chemicals generated during the production process can also lead to allergic or adverse reactions. Environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and light can cause changes in the allergenicity of drugs. Human error in formulating CMM drugs also contributes to adverse drug reactions. The management of allergic reactions to CMM includes taking a good history, avoidance of medications in the same class as those which caused prior reactions, the proper training of staff, adherence to manufacturer guidelines and expiration dates, evaluation of benefit and risk balance, and the formulation of a risk management strategy for the use of CMM. A small test dose of a considered drug before using, improvements in drug purification technology, and proper storage and clinical administration help reduce allergic reactions due to CMM. "
"PURPOSE: Melanoma is an invasive and very aggressive skin cancer due to its multi-drug resistance that results in poor patient survival. There is a need to test new treatment approaches to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce side effects of conventional treatments. METHODS: PLA/PVA nanoparticles carrying both Dacarbazine and zinc phthalocyanine was produced by double emulsion technique. The characterization was performed by dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy. In vitro photodynamic therapy test assay using MV3 melanoma cells as a model has been performed. In vitro cell viability (MTT) was performed to measure cell toxicity of of nanoparticles with and without drugs using human endothelial cells as a model. The in vivo assay (biodistribution/tissue deposition) has been performed using radiolabeled PLA/PVA NPs. RESULTS: The nanoparticles produced showed a mean diameter of about 259 nm with a spherical shape. The in-vitro photodynamic therapy tests demonstrated that the combination is critical to enhance the therapeutic efficacy and it is dose dependent. The in vitro cell toxicity assay using endothelial cells demonstrated that the drug encapsulated into nanoparticles had no significant toxicity compared to control samples. In-vivo results demonstrated that the drug loading affects the biodistribution of the nanoparticle formulations (NPs). Low accumulation of the NPs into the stomach, heart, brain, and kidneys suggested that common side effects of Dacarbazine could be reduced. CONCLUSION: This work reports a robust nanoparticle formulation with the objective to leveraging the synergistic effects of chemo and photodynamic therapies to potentially suppressing the drug resistance and reducing side effects associated with Dacarbazine. The data corroborates that the dual encapsulated NPs showed better in-vitro efficacy when compared with the both compounds alone. The results support the need to have a dual modality NP formulation for melanoma therapy by combining chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy. "
"BACKGROUND: Sixty years ago, Ross discussed the use of oral dapsone in the treatment of acne vulgaris. Ross was fundamental in demonstrating the importance of this medication in dermatology. Following this, topical formulations have been used for the treatment of acne vulgaris which has not responded to traditional therapies. We explore the impact that the discovery of dapsone has had on subsequent research and clinical practice and explore the typical doses and side effects of this often sidelined therapy. METHODS: We conducted a review of the literature on the use of dapsone for acne using key terms ""acne vulgaris,"" ""dapsone,"" ""isotretinoin,"" ""systemic,"" ""topical"" searching databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed. Only articles in English were chosen. The level of evidence was evaluated and selected accordingly listing the studies with the highest level of evidence first using the Oxford Centre of Evidence-Based Medicine 2011 guidance. RESULTS: Oral dapsone and topical dapsone have been used in acne vulgaris and acne fulminans. Systemic dapsone seems to be less effective than other treatment options, and further research is required to examine the use of the topical formulation for acne vulgaris compared with alternative treatments. CONCLUSION: Dermatologists may wish to consider the use of this long-established medication for the treatment of acne vulgaris. With careful monitoring, oral dapsone is an important alternative therapy where isotretinoin is contraindicated or not tolerated. "
"Abstract: Acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) is an allogeneic T cell mediated disease which manifests as a severe inflammatory disease affecting multiple organs including the liver, skin, lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Existing prophylactic and therapeutic approaches in aGvHD include the use of cyclosporine A (CyA), however the currently approved CyA formulations which were designed to optimise systemic CyA bioavailability can have a number of side effects including nephrotoxicity as well as the potential to attenuate the beneficial Graft-versus-Leukemia (GvL) effect. An added complication with CyA is that it has a narrow therapeutic window, and following oral administration is absorbed only from the small intestine, with variable cytochrome P450 metabolism contributing to intra- and inter-patient variability. This study sought to investigate the efficacy of a novel CyA oral formulation enabled by the integrated SmPill® oral drug delivery platform in a humanised mouse model of aGvHD. The study compared the approved optimised CyA (Neoral®) with SmPill®-enabled CyA and a systemic intravenous CyA formulation. Our findings clearly demonstrate superior efficacy of the novel SmPill® CyA in prolonging survival in a clinically relevant humanised aGvHD model. SmPill® CyA significantly reduced pathological score in the small intestine, colon, liver and lung of aGvHD mice. In addition, SmPill® CyA significantly reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in all the GvHD target tissues examined. Notably, SmPill® CyA was significantly more potent in reducing GvHD associated pathology and inflammatory cytokine production compared to the optimised approved oral CyA formulation, Neoral®. "
"Abstract: High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) combined with leucovorin (LV) is the first-line drug therapy for many kinds of malignant tumors. However, the specific treatment plans, such as dosage and duration of administration, are usually formulated according to the clinician's experience and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of methotrexate in patients' plasma, which are responsible for strong individual differences of drug usage. A large number of studies have shown that methotrexate targets the inside of the cell. The key cytotoxic component is the methotrexate polyglutamates (MTXPGs) in the cell. The concentration of methotrexate in plasma does not reflect the efficacy and side effects well. Based on mass spectrometry technology, we developed and validated an accurate, sensitive, and stable method to quantify the intracellular MTX (MTXPG "
"Abstract: The biosimilar concept is now well established. Clinical data accumulated pre- and post-approval have supported biosimilar uptake, in turn stimulating competition in the biologics market and increasing patient access to biologics. Following technological advances, other innovative biologics, such as ""biobetters"" or ""value-added medicines,"" are now reaching the market. These innovative biologics differ from the reference product by offering additional clinical or non-clinical benefits. We discuss these innovative biologics with reference to CT-P13, initially available as an intravenous (IV) biosimilar of reference infliximab. A subcutaneous (SC) formulation, CT-P13 SC, has now been developed. Relative to CT-P13 IV, CT-P13 SC offers clinical benefits in terms of pharmacokinetics, with comparable efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity, as well as increased convenience for patients and reduced demands on healthcare system resources. As was once the case for biosimilars, nomenclature and regulatory pathways for innovative biologics require clarification to support their uptake and ultimately benefit patients. "

Given their worldwide dissemination and the scarcity of studies on marine fish, we evaluated the toxicity of an organic (oxybenzone) and an inorganic (titanium dioxide nanoparticles) UV filter, individually and in a binary mixture, in the turbot ( "
"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a novel cyclosporine formulation for dry eye disease (DED). METHODS: This is an exploratory, multicenter, single-blind, randomized, positive-controlled Phase II clinical trial between cyclosporine ophthalmic gel (CyclAGel) and an open-label comparator (Restasis, positive control). A total of 240 eligible patients with moderate to severe DED were randomized to 4 study groups: CyclAGel 0.05%/once daily (QD) (n = 59), CyclAGel 0.05%/BID (n = 60), CyclAGel 0.1%/QD (n = 60), and Restasis 0.05%/BID (n = 61). After receiving BID dosing of hypromellose eye drops during a 2-week run-in period, patients were randomized to the respective treatment group and dosed QD or BID for 12 weeks. Efficacy was assessed based on a number of sign and symptom end points, including eye dryness score (visual analog scale), 6 other parameters of symptoms for dryness (burning/stinging, itching, foreign body sensation, discomfort, sensitivity to light, and pain), and corneal fluorescein staining. The Schirmer test was used to assess dry eye symptoms (visual analog scale severity) at visit 3 (week 2), visit 4 (week 6), and visit 5 (week 12). FINDINGS: CyclAGel showed a consistent improvement in eye dryness score and the 6 other parameters of symptoms for dryness, corneal fluorescein staining, breakup time, and Schirmer test scores compared with Restasis over the 12-week treatment period. However, there were no statistically significant differences between CyclAGel and Restasis after baseline corrections were made, and the results of the full analysis set remained consistent with those of the per-protocol set (P > 0.05). Moreover, each CyclAGel-treated group (0.05%/QD, 0.05%/BID, and 0.1%/QD) exerted better effects than the Restasis group, and CyclAGel 0.05%/QD showed the most significant improvement. The number of ocular-related treatment-emergent adverse events was low in all treatment groups, with no serious drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events. IMPLICATIONS: CyclAGel showed excellent safety, tolerability, and comfort profiles at 2 concentrations and frequency in moderate to severe DED. "
"Abstract: Although nanoparticles (NPs) bear a great potential in tumour therapy, just a few nanosized drug delivery systems are commercially available. Besides their advantages like passive drug targeting and stable embedment of lipophilic active pharmaceutical ingredients, targeted drug release is a major challenge for a safe therapy. While drug release of commonly used materials depends on physiological factors, nanoparticles prepared by using stimuli responsive polymers offer a promising approach. External irradiation of light-sensitive nanoparticles enables local drug release, resulting in selective accumulation and consequently more effective treatment with less side effects. In this study light-responsive nanoparticles based on a new innovative light-responsive polyester (Nip-SLrPE) combined with poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) were prepared and examined for their physicochemical characteristics and light-triggered properties. As model drug the photosensitizer 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(m-hydroxyphenyl)chlorine (mTHPC) was incorporated and light-depending drug release was investigated. Furthermore, cytotoxic potential of selected formulations for PDT and intracellular accumulation of mTHPC were evaluated. In conclusion, nanoparticles based on the new light-sensitive Nip-SLrPE showed auspicious light-responsive properties, resulting in promising results for a smart drug delivery system. "
"BACKGROUND: Acne is one of the skin diseases that include abnormalities in the production of sebum, changes in the microbial flora, abnormal keratinization, and inflammation. Adapalene is a good choice in the treatment of acne with fewer side effects and high effectiveness. However, the absorption of adapalene through human skin is low. We investigated the effect of several enhancers on the skin absorption of adapalene. METHODS: For the preparation of a topical formulation, this drug needs proper skin absorption. Therefore, to increase the effect of chemical absorption of the Adapalene skin permeability, it should first be put on the skin in a touch of some absorption like Eucalyptus, Urea, Clove oil, propylene glycol, and oleic acid for 1 and 2 hours and was then examined for the passing of the drug on the treated skin and for the effect of absorptions by calculating of the permeability parameters using DSC and FT-IR techniques. RESULT AND CONCLUSION: The results show that the enhancers used increased the permeability of the drug adapalene to water. Several mechanisms including lipid liquefaction, degradation of the fat structure, as well as irreversible denaturation of intracellular creatine caused by Eucalyptus, urea clove oil, PG, and oleic acid are the main mechanisms of drug penetration. Based on the results, it was found that among the enhancers studied, eucalyptus and urea had the highest and the lowest absorption effect in 2- and 1-hour pre-contact, respectively. "

"Abstract: The dissemination of tumor metastasis in the peritoneal cavity, also called peritoneal metastasis (PM) or carcinomatosis, represents a late stage of gastrointestinal and gynecological cancer with very poor prognosis, even when cytoreductive surgery is effective, due to residual microscopic disease. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the management of peritoneal metastasis has been clinically limited by the low tumor selectivity of photosensitizers (PS) and important adverse effects. Here, we propose extracellular nanovesicles (EVs) derived from mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) as the fourth generation of immune active PS vectors that are able to target peritoneal metastasis with superior selectivity, potentiate PDT cytotoxicity at the tumor site without affecting healthy tissues, modulate the tumor microenvironment of immunocompetent colorectal and ovarian carcinomatosis models, and promote an antitumor immune response. A pioneering strategy was developed for high yield, large-scale production of MSC-EVs encapsulating the drug  "
"BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is the representative drug among the disease- modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. However, the conventional treatment with MTX showed many limitations and side effects. OBJECTIVE: To strengthen the targeting ability and circulation time of MTX in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, the present study focused on developing a novel drug delivery system of methotrexate-loaded human serum albumin nanoparticles (MTX-NPs) modified by mannose, which are referred to as MTX-M-NPs. METHODS: Firstly, mannose-derived carboxylic acid was synthesized and further modified on the surface of MTX-NPs to prepare MTX-M-NPs. The formulation of nanoparticles was optimized by the method of central composite design (CCD), with the drug lipid ratio, oil-aqueous ratio, and cholesterol or lecithin weight as the independent variables. The average particle size and encapsulation efficiency were the response variables. The response of different formulations was calculated, and the response surface diagram, contour diagram, and mathematical equation were used to relate the dependent and independent variables to predict the optimal formula ratio. The uptake of MTX-M-NPs by neutrophils was studied through confocal laser detection. Further, MTX-M-NPs were subjected to assessment of the pharmacokinetics profile after intravenous injection with Sprague-Dawley rats. RESULTS: This targeting drug delivery system was successfully developed. Results from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy analysis can verify the successful preparation of this drug delivery system. Based on the optimized formula, MTX-M-NPs were prepared with a particle size of 188.17 ± 1.71 nm and an encapsulation rate of 95.55 ± 0.33%. MTX-M-NPs displayed significantly higher cellular uptake than MTX-NPs. The pharmacokinetic results showed that MTX-M-NPs could prolong the in vivo circulation time of MTX. CONCLUSION: This targeting drug delivery system laid a promising foundation for the treatment of RA. "
"PURPOSE: Ruxolitinib (Jakafi) is a Janus kinase 1 and 2 small molecule inhibitor that the Food and Drug Administration approved for myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. It has been expanded to off-label treatment for a variety of dermatologic conditions, with several clinical trials ongoing. A review of available studies and cases of off-label uses was performed to guide clinicians seeking evidence on the efficacy of this Janus kinase inhibitor for dermatologic disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched with the term ""ruxolitinib,"" and results were manually reviewed to identify published data on off-label uses of ruxolitinib. Studies included are structured by quality of evidence available. RESULTS: Ruxolitinib may have utility in the treatment of atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and vitiligo, with data from open-label and randomized trials supporting efficacy of topical formulations. Evidence of utility for alopecia areata is mixed and differs depending on topical versus oral form. Evidence for numerous other conditions is available through case reports and case series. CONCLUSIONS: There is growing evidence supporting potential off-label use of oral and topical ruxolitinib for a wide range of skin conditions. There are several ongoing investigations of ruxolitinib use in dermatology that will undoubtedly better define its efficacy and appropriate use in dermatology. "
"BACKGROUND: Depending on their distinct properties, titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO RESULTS: TiO2-NP treatment apparently induced a broken structure of the junctional plaques, conferring decreased transendothelial electrical resistance, a permeable paracellular cleft, and improved cell migration in vitro. This might involve rapid activation of metalloproteinase, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17), and ADAM17-mediated claudin-5 degradation. For the in vivo study, C57BL/6 mice were administered a single dose of TiO2-NP intravitreally and then subjected to a complete ophthalmology examination. Fluorescein leakage and reduced blood flow at the optical disc indicated a damaged inner blood-retinal barrier induced by TiO CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data demonstrate that TiO2-NP can damage endothelial cell function, thereby affecting retinal electrophysiology.

"Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are a group of diseases with very high positions in the ranking of cancer incidence and mortality. While they show common features regarding the molecular mechanisms involved in cancer development, organ-specific pathophysiological processes may trigger distinct signaling pathways and intricate interactions with inflammatory cells from the tumoral milieu and mediators involved in tumorigenesis. The treatment of GI cancers is a topic of increasing interest due to the severity of these diseases, their impact on the patients' survivability and quality of life, and the burden they set on the healthcare system. As the efficiency of existing drugs is hindered by chemoresistance and adverse reactions when administered in high doses, new therapies are sought, and emerging drugs, formulations, and substance synergies are the focus of a growing number of studies. A class of chemicals with great potential through anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-tumoral effects is phytochemicals, and capsaicin in particular is the subject of intensive research looking to validate its position in complementing cancer treatment. Our paper thoroughly reviews the available scientific evidence concerning the effects of capsaicin on major GI cancers and its interactions with the molecular pathways involved in the course of these diseases.

"Abstract: Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) has detrimental effects on human health. It induces oxidative stress, deregulates signaling mechanisms, and produces DNA mutations, factors that ultimately can lead to the development of skin cancer. Therefore, reducing exposure to UVR is of major importance. Among available measures to diminish exposure is the use of sunscreens. However, recent studies indicate that several of the currently used filters have adverse effects on marine ecosystems and human health. This situation leads to the search for new photoprotective compounds that, apart from offering protection, are environmentally friendly. The answer may lie in the same marine ecosystems since molecules such as mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and scytonemin can serve as the defense system of some marine organisms against UVR. This review will discuss the harmful effects of UVR and the mechanisms that microalgae have developed to cope with it. Then it will focus on the biological distribution, characteristics, extraction, and purification methods of MAAs and scytonemin molecules to finally assess its potential as new filters for sunscreen formulation. "
"Abstract: Artificial sunscreens are already gaining traction in order to protect the skin from sunburns, photoaging and photocarcinogenesis. However, the efficacy and safety of most artificial sunscreen constituents are hindered by their photostability, toxicity and damage to marine ecosystems. Natural selection and evolution have ensured that plants and animals have developed effective protective mechanisms against the deleterious side effects of oxidative stress and ultraviolet radiation (UV). Hence, natural antioxidants such as sun blockers are drawing considerable attention. The exact mechanism by which natural components act as sunscreen molecules has not been clearly established. However, conjugated π system is reported to play an important role in protecting the vital genetic material within the organism. Compared to artificial sunscreens, natural sunscreens with strong UV absorptive capacities are largely limited by low specific extinction value and by their inability to spread in large-scale sunscreen cosmetic applications. Previous studies have documented that natural components exert their photoprotective effects (such as improved skin elasticity and hydration, skin texture, and wrinkles) through their antioxidant effects, and through the regulation of UV-induced skin inflammation, barrier impairment and aging. This review focuses on natural antioxidant topical formulations with sun protection factor (SPF). Lignin, melanin, silymarin and other ingredients have been added to high sun protection nature sunscreens without any physical or chemical UV filters. This paper also provides a reference for adopting novel technical measures (extracting high content components, changing the type of solution, optimizing formulation, applying Nano technology, et al) to design and prepare nature sunscreen formulations equated with commercial sunscreen formulations. Another strategy is to add natural antioxidants from plants, animals, microorganisms and marine organisms as special enhancer or modifier ingredients to reinforce SPF values. Although the photoprotective effects of natural components have been established, their deleterious side effects have not been elucidated. "
"Abstract: Acne Vulgaris is one of the most common chronic inflammatory skin disorders that affect majority of teen-agers worldwide. Isotretinoin (ITT) is the drug of choice in the management of acne, but, it suffers from serious side-effects including hepatotoxicity, and some psychological disturbances following its oral intake. The objective of this study was to develop and optimize ITT loaded nanoemulsions (ITT-SNEDDS) and to incorporate resveratrol (RSV)in optimum formulation to decrease ITT side effects The ITT solubility was first tested in various essential oils, surfactants, and co-surfactants to select the essential nanoemulsion ingredients. Mixture design was applied to study the effect of independent variables and their interactions on the selected dependent responses. The developed ITT-SNEDDS were characterized for their globule size and  "
"OBJECTIVES: There are few comparative data for tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Historical data for reference product/biosimilar intravenous infliximab, or adalimumab and etanercept, were pooled and compared with phase 3 study results for a subcutaneous (SC) formulation of the infliximab biosimilar CT-P13, in a systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42019149621). RESULTS: The authors identified 13 eligible controlled trials that randomized over 5400 participants to prespecified treatments of interest. Comparison with pooled historical data suggested a numerical advantage for CT-P13 SC over intravenous infliximab for almost every prespecified efficacy outcome evaluated, including Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (C-reactive protein/erythrocyte sedimentation rate), Clinical/Simplified Disease Activity Index scores, American College of Rheumatology responses, and multiple measures of disease remission and low disease activity; for the majority of outcomes, there was no overlap in 95% confidence intervals between groups. A numerical advantage for CT-P13 SC was also observed for safety outcomes (adverse events, infections, and discontinuations). Similar, but less marked, trends were observed for comparison with historical efficacy and safety data for adalimumab/etanercept. CONCLUSION: CT-P13 SC offers an improved or similar benefit-to-harm ratio compared with infliximab (intravenous) and adalimumab/etanercept, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe RA. "
"Abstract: This study proposed a framework to estimate health risks due to exposure of mixture of nanoparticles (NPs) from surface water, for the first time, as per authors' best knowledge. The framework consisted of hazard identification, exposure assessment, dose-response assessment, risk characterization and risk management steps. Concentrations of mixture of NPs and associated ions were compiled and range of values were used for exposure estimation. The resulting concentrations of nanoparticle and metal ions in simulated digestive fluid were calculated and used to estimate exposure dose to digestive system organs during a hypothetical exposure of water during recreational activity. Exposure doses of different possible combinations of ZnO NP, CuO NP, Zn "

"Abstract: Cadmium (Cd), prevailing in most of the agricultural lands of the world contaminates food chain, thereby causing several health implications. It has become the main heavy metal contaminant in most of the agricultural lands of Pakistan due to the widespread use of phosphate fertilizers besides application of irrigation water contaminated with industrial and mining effluents. Plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) are capable to enhance growth and metal stress tolerance in supplemented plants. Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) are capable to alleviate various abiotic stresses when applied to plants. During current research, the efficacy of single and combined application of Bacillus fortis IAGS 223 and ZnO-NPs was evaluated for alleviation of Cd (75 mg kg "
"Abstract: Tofacitinib (TFB), a Janus kinase inhibitor, has shown excellent success off-label in treating various dermatological diseases, especially alopecia areata (AA). However, TFB's safe and targeted delivery into hair follicles (HFs) is highly desirable due to its systemic adverse effects. Nanoparticles (NPs) can enhance targeted follicular drug delivery and minimize interfollicular permeation and thereby reduce systemic drug exposure. In this study, we report a facile method to assemble the stable and uniform 240 nm TFB loaded squalenyl derivative (SqD) nanoparticles (TFB SqD NPs) in aqueous solution, which allowed an excellent loading capacity (LC) of 20%. The SqD NPs showed an enhanced TFB delivery into HFs compared to the aqueous formulations of plain drug in an  "
"Abstract: Photodynamic therapy is a medical technique, which is gaining increasing attention to treat various types of cancer. Among the investigated classes of photosensitizers (PSs), the use of Ru(II) polypyridine complexes is gaining momentum. However, the currently investigated compounds generally show poor cancer cell selectivity. As a consequence, high drug doses are needed, which can cause side effects. To overcome this limitation, there is a need for the development of a suitable drug delivery system to increase the amount of PS delivered to the tumor. Herein, we report the encapsulation of a promising Ru(II) polypyridyl complex into polymeric nanoparticles with terminal biotin groups. Thanks to this design, the particles showed much higher selectivity for cancer cells in comparison to noncancerous cells in a 2D monolayer and 3D multicellular tumor spheroid model. As a highlight, upon intravenous injection of an identical amount of the Ru(II) polypyridine complex of the nanoparticle formulation, an improved accumulation inside an adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial tumor of a mouse up to a factor of 8.7 compared to the Ru complex itself was determined. The nanoparticles were found to have a high phototoxic effect upon one-photon (500 nm) or two-photon (800 nm) excitation with eradication of adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial tumor inside a mouse model. Overall, this work describes, to the best of our knowledge, the first  "
"BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a main cause of aging of sun-exposed skin, but greater attention is being focused on the damaging effects of high-energy visible (HEV) light (400 and 500 nm). HEV light exposure has increased with expanding use of consumer electronics, such as smartphones, which have a peak emission in the 400-490 nm range. Sunscreens containing titanium dioxide and zinc oxide protect against UVA and UVB radiation but provide limited protection against HEV light. AIM: Iron oxides including red iron oxide (Fe METHODS: The percent of HEV light attenuation from 400 nm to 490 nm light was measured in vitro using a technique known as diffuse transmittance spectroscopy using a Perkin Elmer Lambda™ 750 UV/Vis/NIR Spectrophotometer equipped with a 100-mm integrating Labsphere RESULTS: Products formulated with zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and iron oxides demonstrated 71.9%-85.6% attenuation across the tested wavelengths of 415-465 nm. CONCLUSION: Sunscreens formulated with iron oxides provide enhanced protection against blue light, especially when combined with zinc oxide. To our knowledge, similar studies with iron oxides have not been performed. "
"BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris is one of the most common dermatological diseases, and it is known that various factors are related to triggering this condition in a patient. In particular, although the use of cosmetics is thought to be associated with the onset of a patient developing acne, there are few studies that have been conducted to date on this disease and its related factors. METHODS: To begin with, a total of 539 patients with acne vulgaris, who visited three dermatologic clinics in Korea, were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their condition in relation to clinical features and exacerbating factors, including the use of cosmetics. The patients all provided an accurate acne treatment history as well. RESULTS: Among the respondents, 38.1% of patients who failed treatment answered that the condition of their acne was worsened by the continued use of cosmetics, which was significantly higher than 26.3% of the surveyed treatment-naive patients (P < .05). In this relation, double cleansing (cleansing twice using oil and water-based cleanser) and the number of cosmetics in use were also noted in higher numbers than in the treatment-failure patients. As noted, the liquid-type foundation and concealer were frequently used in this group. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the influence of cosmetics, especially in acne patients with a history of treatment failures. These results also show differences according to specific cosmetic types and formulations. Therefore, overall dermatologists should consider advising about cosmetic use to acne patients along with medical treatment options for the patients with acne. "
"Abstract: Radiation-induced skin injury (RSI) refers to a frequently occurring complication of radiation therapy. Nearly 90% of patients having received radiation therapy underwent moderate-to-severe skin reactions, severely reducing patients' quality of life and adversely affecting their disease treatment. No gold standard has been formulated for RSIs. In the present study, the mechanism of RSI and topical medications was discussed. Besides, this study can be referenced for clinicians to treat RSIs to guide subsequent clinical medicine. "
"PURPOSE: This pilot study investigated the in vivo therapeutic potential and tolerability of a multimodal ophthalmic formulation, topical eye drops (TED), for acute mustard gas keratopathy (MGK) using a rabbit model. METHODS: Twenty New Zealand White rabbits were used. Only right eyes of 18 rabbits (oculus dexter [OD]) received single sulfur mustard gas (SM) vapor injury, whereas contralateral eyes were left untreated or received TED for tolerabilty evaluation. Two rabbit eyes received no treatment and served as age-matched naive control. The four groups were: Naive (oculus sinister [OS] untreated eyes; n = 9); TED (OS treated only with TED BID for 3 days; n = 9); SM (OD exposed to SM vapor; n = 9); and SM+TED (OD exposed to SM+TED BID for 3 days; n = 9). Ocular examination in live rabbits were performed utilizing slit-lamp biomicroscopy, Fantes grading system, fluorescein staining, Schirmer's tests, pachymetry, and applanation tonometry. Cellular and molecular changes in rabbit corneas were assessed after humane euthanasia on day-3 and day-7 with histopathological and real-time polymerase chain reaction PCR techniques. RESULTS: TED to rabbit eyes was found tolerable in vivo. SM-exposed eyes showed significant increase in Fantes scores, central corneal thickness (CCT), Schirmer's test, epithelium-stroma separation, and corneal edema. TED mitigated clinical symptoms by reducing corneal edema, Fantes scores, CCT, and Schirmer's test. Further, TED decreased SM-induced corneal haze, inflammatory and profibrotic markers, transforming growth factor-TGF-β1 and cyclooxygenase-2COX-2, and damage to corneal structure, including epithelial-stromal integrity. CONCLUSIONS: The developed multimodal eyedrop formulation, TED, has potential to mitigate acute MGK effectively in vivo. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: TED is effective against MGK. "
"Abstract: Capsaicin, the pungent ingredient in chili peppers, produces intense burning pain in humans. Capsaicin selectively activates the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), which is enriched in nociceptive primary afferents, and underpins the mechanism for capsaicin-induced burning pain. Paradoxically, capsaicin has long been used as an analgesic. The development of topical patches and injectable formulations containing capsaicin has led to application in clinical settings to treat chronic pain conditions, such as neuropathic pain and the potential to treat osteoarthritis. More detailed determination of the neurobiological mechanisms of capsaicin-induced analgesia should provide the logical rationale for capsaicin therapy and help to overcome the treatment's limitations, which include individual differences in treatment outcome and procedural discomfort. Low concentrations of capsaicin induce short-term defunctionalization of nociceptor terminals. This phenomenon is reversible within hours and, hence, likely does not account for the clinical benefit. By contrast, high concentrations of capsaicin lead to long-term defunctionalization mediated by the ablation of TRPV1-expressing afferent terminals, resulting in long-lasting analgesia persisting for several months. Recent studies have shown that capsaicin-induced Ca "
"Abstract: Dapsone (DAP) is a long-established molecule that remains a promising therapeutic agent for various diseases mainly because it combines antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities. Its oral application, however, is limited by the dose-dependent hematological side effects that may rise from systemic exposure. As an alternative to overcome this limitation, the administration of DAP to the skin has witnessed prominent interest in the past 20 years, particularly when applied to the treatment of dermatological disorders. In this review, all technological strategies proposed to the topical delivery of DAP are presented. Most of the reported studies have been devoted to the clinical use and safety of a gel formulation containing both solubilized and microcrystalline drug, however, the technological characteristics of such preparation are still missing. In parallel, the incorporation of DAP into vesicular and particulate carriers (e.g. nano- and microemulsions, niosomes, invasomes, bilosomes, cubosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, polymeric nanocapsules and polymer-lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles) appears to be an alternative to provide greater drug release control, enhanced drug solubilization and follicular targeting. Indeed, the main application of DAP topical formulations reported in the literature was the treatment of acne vulgaris, a disease located in the hair follicle. Other diseases affecting different regions of the skin (e.g. cutaneous lupus erythematosus and cutaneous leishmaniasis), however, may also benefit from a topical therapeutic regimen containing DAP. Therefore, the investigation of appendageal route in comparison to passive transmembrane diffusion as a function of targeted disease, as well as pharmacokinetic studies, are perspectives highlighted herein. Such studies may drive future efforts towards the rational development of safe and effective technologies to deliver DAP to the skin. Graphical abstract. "
"INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer is one of the most aggressive forms of cancer that leads to a high mortality rate amongst several cancer types and it is a widely recurrent cancer globally. The use of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) in the formulation of sun cream, food flavors, and colorings due to its varied biological properties. The extensive significance of nanoparticles encourages their production but the approaches are a common challenge in concluding the direct beneficial effect for the disease treatment. Hence, in the present study, zinc oxide-loaded syringic acid (ZnO-SYR) phytochemical was used to elucidate the therapeutic effect against lung cancer. METHODS: The ZnO-SYR nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering, and FT-IR analysis. The characterized ZnO-SYR was tested on in vivo mouse model of lung cancer (benzo(a)pyrene (BAP)) and in vitro A549 cells. RESULTS: The results demonstrated the significant restoration of body weight with attenuated serum marker enzymes compared to BAP-treated animals. In addition, cytokine estimation revealed ameliorated levels of TNF-α, interleukins, IL-6, IL-1β with evidenced histological observations in ZnO-SYR-treated mice compared to BAP-induced lung cancer mice. DISCUSSION: Furthermore, cytotoxicity analysis demonstrated the altered mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), with a profound increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and apoptosis mechanism by ZnO-SYR compared to control cells. The conclusions of the present study put forward an evident confirmation of the protective and beneficial effects of zincoxide-loaded syringic acid against the BAP-induced lung cancer model. "
"Abstract: The dental intracanal disinfection is crucial to achieve the success of endodontic treatment, avoiding the maintenance of endodontic infections. Chlorhexidine digluconate can act as an irrigating agent for it. However, it can cause tissue irritation in high concentrations. Therefore, combinations with other antimicrobial agents and more efficient therapeutic alternatives are studied, which make it possible to administer drugs more safely and with minimal adverse effects. Thus, the objective of this study was the development of a microemulsion containing chlorhexidine digluconate and essential oil of Lippia sidoides to be used for disinfection of dental root canals and to evaluate its profile of substantivity and antimicrobial activity. The microemulsions were obtained through phase diagrams, using the spontaneous formation method. We completed a physical-chemical characterization and evaluate the stability of the microemulsions, in addition to the substantivity profile in a bovine root dentin model, and in vitro antibacterial effect on Enterococcus faecalis. A method for quantifying chlorhexidine was developed using UV-Vis spectroscopy. The microemulsions showed acid pH, conductivity above 1.3 μScm "
"Abstract: Permeation of sunscreens agents reduces its effectiveness and safety, leading to systemic circulation and causing unknown adverse effects. In order to maintain the sunscreen efficacy and safety, the filters must stay on the skin surface, with minimum penetration through dermis. Even facing the possibility of filters permeation, the use of sunscreen is important to avoid skin damage as erythema, free-radicals formation, skin ageing and skin cancer, caused by ultraviolet radiation. Aiming potential side effects caused by topical absorption of sunscreens, studies are carried to improve formulation characteristics and stability, reduce skin permeation and evaluate sun protections factor (SPF). Current assays to detect the permeation of sunscreens involve in vivo or in vitro studies, to simulate physiological conditions of use. The aim of this review is to revisit sunscreen skin permeation data over the last decade and the factors that can enhance skin permeation or improve the sunscreen efficacy. "
"Abstract: Skin diseases are the fourth leading non-fatal skin conditions that act as a burden and affect the world economy globally. This condition affects the quality of a patient's life and has a pronounced impact on both their physical and mental state. Treatment of these skin conditions with conventional approaches shows a lack of efficacy, long treatment duration, recurrence of conditions, systemic side effects, etc., due to improper drug delivery. However, these pitfalls can be overcome with the applications of nanomedicine-based approaches that provide efficient site-specific drug delivery at the target site. These nanomedicine-based strategies are evolved as potential treatment opportunities in the form of nanocarriers such as polymeric and lipidic nanocarriers, nanoemulsions along with emerging others viz. carbon nanotubes for dermatological treatment. The current review focuses on challenges faced by the existing conventional treatments along with the topical therapeutic perspective of nanocarriers in treating various skin diseases. A total of 213 articles have been reviewed and the application of different nanocarriers in treating various skin diseases has been explained in detail through case studies of previously published research works. The toxicity related aspects of nanocarriers are also discussed. "
"Abstract: Corticosteroids are a nonspecific immune modulator used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Topical and systemic forms of corticosteroids have been shown to be effective in induction of clinical remission and remain first-line therapy for acute severe ulcerative colitis. A large proportion of patients experience adverse effects, however, including some serious adverse effects, including infection and increased mortality. Newer formulations of gut selective corticosteroids have reduced adverse effects associated with steroids. "
"BACKGROUND: All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is widely employed in the treatment of various proliferative and inflammatory diseases. However, its therapeutic efficacy is imperiled due to its poor solubility and stability. Latter was surmounted by its incorporation into a solid matrix of lipidic nanoparticles (SLNs). METHODS: ATRA loaded SLNs (ATRA-SLNs) were prepared using a novel microemulsification technique (USPTO 9907758) and an optimal composition and were characterized in terms of morphology, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and powder X-ray diffraction studies (PXRD). In vitro release, oral plasma pharmacokinetics (in rats) and stability studies were also done. RESULTS: Rod-shaped ATRA-SLNs could successfully incorporate 3.7 mg/mL of ATRA, increasing its solubility (from 4.7 μg/mL) by 787 times, having an average particle size of 131.30 ± 5.0 nm and polydispersibility of 0.283. PXRD, DSC, and FTIR studies confirmed the formation of SLNs. Assay/total drug content and entrapment efficiency of ATRA-SLNs was 92.50 ± 2.10% and 84.60 ± 3.20% (n=6), respectively, which was maintained even on storage for one year under refrigerated conditions as an aqueous dispersion. In vitro release in 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 3% tween 80 was extended 12 times from 2h for free ATRA to 24 h for ATRA-SLNs depicting Korsmeyer Peppas release. Oral administration in rats showed 35.03 times enhanced bioavailability for ATRA-SLNs. CONCLUSION: Present work reports preparation and evaluation of bioenhanced ATRA-SLNs containing a high concentration of ATRA (>15 times than that reported by others). Latter is attributed to the novel preparation process and intelligent selection of components. Lay Summary: All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) shows an array of pharmacological activities but its efficacy is limited due to poor solubility, stability and side effects. In present study its solubility and efficacy is improved by 787 and 35.5 times, respectively upon incorporation into solid lipid nanoparticles (ATRA-SLNs). Latter extended its release by 12 times and provided stability for at least a year under refrigeration. A controlled and sustained release will reduce dose related side effects. ATRA-SLNs reported presently can thus be used in treatment /prophylaxis of disorders like cancers, tuberculosis, age related macular degeneration and acne and as an immune-booster. "
"Abstract: Various therapeutic techniques have been studied for treating cancer precisely and effectively, such as targeted drug delivery, phototherapy, tumor-specific catalytic therapy, and synergistic therapy, which, however, evoke numerous challenges due to the inherent limitations of these therapeutic modalities and intricate biological circumstances as well. With the remarkable advances of nanotechnology, nanoplatform-based cascade engineering, as an efficient and booming strategy, has been tactfully introduced to optimize these cancer therapies. Based on the designed nanoplatforms, pre-supposed cascade processes could be triggered under specific conditions to generate/deliver more therapeutic species or produce stronger tumoricidal effects inside tumors, aiming to achieve cancer therapy with increased anti-tumor efficacy and diminished side effects. In this review, the recent advances in nanoplatform-based cascade engineering for cancer therapy are summarized and discussed, with an emphasis on the design of smart nanoplatforms with unique structures, compositions and properties, and the implementation of specific cascade processes by means of endogenous tumor microenvironment (TME) resources and/or exogenous energy inputs. This fascinating strategy presents unprecedented potential in the enhancement of cancer therapies, and offers better controllability, specificity and effectiveness of therapeutic functions compared to the corresponding single components/functions. In the end, challenges and prospects of such a burgeoning strategy in the field of cancer therapy will be discussed, hopefully to facilitate its further development to meet the personalized treatment demands.

"Abstract: With the increasing debate on sustainability, there is a strong market trend to formulate more sustainable products for topical application. Several studies emphasize the potential applications of natural, organic, or green chemistry-derived ingredients, but comparative studies between conventional ingredients and sustainable alternatives are lacking. This type of study is considered an excellent baseline and time-saving strategy for future studies. In addition, one of the main challenges of replacing ingredients by sustainable alternatives in topical vehicles is to maintain high-quality products. Thus, the main goal of this research study was to create a well-defined strategy supported by specific experimental data for the development of sustainable topical vehicles with high-quality standards. The study was designed to evaluate the effects of replacing conventional ingredients (e.g., hydrocarbons, silicones, and preservatives) by sustainable ones on the physical, chemical, and microbiological features of topical emulsions. Additionally, in vivo assessment studies were performed to evaluate the safety, biological efficacy, and sensorial aspects of the developed formulations. The results obtained showed that the replacement of ingredients by sustainable alternatives has an effective impact on the physicochemical and structural properties of the emulsions, mainly on their rheological behavior. However, using appropriate strategies for ingredient selection and rheological adjustment, it is possible to overcome some barriers created by the use of natural raw materials, thus developing appealing and high-quality sustainable topical vehicles.

"BACKGROUND: Successful canine sarcoptic mange treatment requires immediate efficacy to eliminate active mites, and sustained activity to prevent re-infestation from in-contact animals and fomites. With extended acaricidal activity, fluralaner has been shown to be effective for treating this disease. To confirm this potential under field conditions, two fluralaner formulations were administered to mite-infested, client-owned dogs. METHODS: Households qualified for inclusion if they had at least one dog positive for Sarcoptes scabiei mites, confirmed by skin scraping, and at least one dog with clinical signs evocative of sarcoptic mange. Households were allocated to groups of dogs to receive a single treatment with either oral (Bravecto RESULTS: There were 98 participating households and 135 dogs enrolled across Albania, France, Italy and Portugal. On Day 28, more than 90% of dogs in each group were negative for mites. On Days 56 and 84, all study dogs were free of mites and most dermatological signs of sarcoptic mange had resolved. There were no treatment-related adverse events in any group. CONCLUSIONS: A single treatment of client-owned, sarcoptic mange-affected dogs with either fluralaner chewable tablets or fluralaner spot-on formulation proved a safe and effective treatment of infestations with S. scabiei var. canis, maintained through 84 days (12 weeks) after treatment.

"Abstract: Although sunlight provides several benefits, ultraviolet (UV) radiation plays an important role in the development of various skin damages such as erythema, photoaging, and photocarcinogenesis. Despite cells having endogenous defense systems, damaged DNA may not be efficiently repaired at chronic exposure. In this sense, it is necessary to use artificial defense strategies such as sunscreen formulations. UV filters should scatter, reflect, or absorb solar UV radiation in order to prevent direct or indirect DNA lesions. However, the safety of UV filters is a matter of concern due to several controversies reported in literature, such as endocrine alterations, allergies, increased oxidative stress, phototoxic events, among others. Despite these controversies, the way in which sunscreens are tested is essential to ensure safety. Sunscreen regulation includes mandatory test for phototoxicity, but photogenotoxicity testing is not recommended as a part of the standard photosafety testing program. Although available photobiological tests are still the first approach to assess photosafety, they are limited. Some existing tests do not always provide reliable results, mainly due to limitations regarding the nature of the assessed phototoxic effect, cell UV sensitivity, and the irradiation protocols. These aspects bring queries regarding the safety of sunscreen wide use and suggest the demand for the development of robust and efficient  "
"BACKGROUND: Hair fall is a widespread problem among all genders, ages, and ethnicity with both physical and psychological effects. OBJECTIVE: This clinical study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a hair serum formulation containing amla extract, freeze-dried coconut water, and the micronutrient selenium along with sandalwood odorant and peanut shell extract in healthy male and female volunteers with hair fall. METHODS: A total of 42 subjects were enrolled and completed the study and they used the test product daily for 90 days. TrichoScan RESULT AND DISCUSSION: After 90 days of test product application, there was a significant improvement in hair growth rate (<0.0001), hair density (<0.0001), vellus hair density (<0.0001), and terminal hair density (<0.0001) in comparison to baseline. There was a significant reduction in hair fall with bulb (<0.0001) and without bulb (<0.0001), and hair thinning (<0.0001) compared to the baseline measurement. Adverse events were not recorded during the study. No skin intolerance was reported during the study, and the test product was considered dermatologically safe to use. "
"Abstract: Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) is found on sensory neurons, keratinocytes, sebocytes, and dendritic cells. Activated TRPV1 channels are believed to help propagate the itch sensation. Therefore, there has been great interest in targeting TRPV1 to treat pruritus. Since oral formulations aimed at TRPV1 have led to adverse effects such as hyperthermia, there has been emphasis on developing novel topical agents. Several companies are investigating topical TRPV1 anti-pruritic compounds and the initial data has been very promising. These drugs have the potential to be important treatment options for the management of itch. This paper reviews topical products in current development for pruritus that target TRPV1 channels. "

"Abstract: Combination therapy by two or multiple drugs with different mechanisms of action is a promising strategy in cancer treatment. In this regard, a wide range of chemotherapeutics has used simultaneously to achieve the synergistic effect and overcome the adverse side effects of single-drug therapy. Herein, we developed a biocompatible nanoparticle-based system composed of nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) and amino acid l-lysine for efficient co-delivery of model chemotherapeutic methotrexate (MTX) and polyphenol compound curcumin (CUR) to the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The drugs could release in a sustained and acidic-facilitate manner. In vitro cytotoxicity results represented the superior anti-tumor efficacy of the dual-drug-loaded nanocarriers. Possible inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis in the cells treated with different formulations of CUR and MTX were explored by cell cycle analysis and DAPI staining. Overall, the engineered nanosystem can be used as suitable candidates to achieve efficient multi-drug delivery for combination cancer therapy. "
"BACKGROUND: 5-Aminolaevulinic acid (5ALA) is a precursor of the strong sensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the heme synthesis pathway. We conducted aclinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 5ALA photodynamic therapy (PDT) using a light-emitting diode (LED) in patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). METHODS: Data for 51 CIN patients who underwent 5ALA-PDT between 2012 and 2017 were prospectively analysed. After a 20 % 5ALA jelly formulation was topically applied to the cervix, the region was irradiated with red light at approximately 633 nm to excite PpIX for treatment. We estimated outcomes by cytology, pathology, and human papilloma virus (HPV) testing after PDT. RESULTS: Patients underwent two PDT sessions at one-week intervals during outpatient treatment and achieved favourable results without photosensitivity and severe adverse events. Over a long follow-up period, 96.1 % of all patients showed some positive effects, including approximately 70 % with a complete response (CR), 10 % with a partial response, and 15 % with downgrades. The HPV clearance rate in patients with CR was 79.4 %. Recurrence occurred in five patients who mostly remained HPV-positive after PDT. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our study, topical 5ALA-PDT using an LED light source potentially represents a safe treatment for CIN on an outpatient basis. "
"Abstract: Skin exposure to solar radiation can cause many adverse effects. In addition to the sun protection factor (SPF), a parameter associated with Ultraviolet B (UVB) protection, significant evidence emphasized the crucial importance of a well-balanced protection against ultraviolet A (UVA) and for some indications, against high-energy visible light. Synergy between UV filters and filter photostability together with film-forming ingredients such as polymers that ensure the homogeneous distribution of UV filters on the skin are key factors to avoid UVA- and UVB-provoked detrimental effects of solar radiation. Clinical studies mimicking real conditions of use have been performed. The results show that a well-balanced sunscreen with at least an SPF-to-UVA protection factor ratio < 3 provides the most effective protection against DNA damage, skin photoimmunosuppression, photodermatoses, and pigmentation disorders. In addition, cosmetically pleasant sunscreens allow a sufficient amount to be applied and re-applied by consumers, ensuring continuous and even coverage of the exposed skin. "
"Abstract: Hyperpigmentation is a common concern of patients in aesthetic practice. There are various treatment options, but topical depigmenting agents such as hydroquinone (HQ) are usually a first-line option. Given HQ's side effects and potential controversy over its long-term use from prior animal studies, there is a consumer demand for non-HQ topical formulations that provide similar efficacy, but with a reduced adverse reaction profile to HQ. There is increasing evidence to support the use of selective growth factors, tranexamic acid, niacinamide, arbutin, and Vitamin C in improving hyperpigmentation. This study sought to determine whether a non-HQ topical formulation, composed of the aforementioned ingredients, could provide similar or improved efficacy to topical HQ, but with a reduced adverse reaction profile. This single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled split face study investigated the safety and efficacy of a proprietary product SKNB19 compared with hydroquinone 4% (HQ4%) in treating hyperpigmentation. Eighteen adult subjects with facial pigmentation were randomly assigned to have one side of their face treated with SKNB19 twice a day (morning and night application) and the other treated with HQ4% applied nightly. Patients used a 5-point scale to self-assess their overall appearance, and a 4-point scale to assess redness, irritation, and tolerability to the skin-brightening creams. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test whether there was a statistical difference between the two treatments. Three-dimensional imaging was performed before treatment was administered and again 1 month following treatment initiation using a Canfield Vectra 3D imaging system. Five independent reviewers comprising two dermatologists, two facial plastic surgeons, and one oculoplastic surgeon graded and performed a qualitative comparative assessment of each side of the face using the before and after images. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test whether there was a statistical difference in overall appearance between SKNB19- and HQ4%-treated sides. SKNB19-treated hyperpigmentation had a statistically significant improvement in the overall appearance of hyperpigmentation and was shown to be 28.5% better than HQ4%-treated skin in the patient self-assessment and 27% better than HQ4%-treated skin in the independent reviewer assessment. On pair-wise comparison, the independent reviewer assessment also showed that 88.2% of the SKNB19-treated sides appeared equal or better than the HQ4%-treated sides. One patient dropped out of the study because of severe intolerance to HQ4%. No patients experienced intolerance to SKNB19, and all were able to continue its use without adverse effects. SKNB19-treated hyperpigmentation also had a statistically significant reduction in irritation when compared with HQ4%-treated hyperpigmentation. Patients reported a reduction in redness when using SKNB19 as opposed to HQ4%, but these figures did not reach statistical significance. This study supports that SKNB19, a recently developed non-HQ proprietary product, is safe and effective in improving hyperpigmentation. SKNB19 significantly improved the appearance of hyperpigmentation when compared with HQ4% in both patient self-assessment and independent reviewer assessment. SKNB19 exhibited a lower adverse reaction profile and was significantly better tolerated than HQ4%. SKNB19 should be considered as a safe and effective non-HQ alternative for the management of hyperpigmentation. "
"Abstract: Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is characterized by skin barrier disruption and an aberrant immune response. Doxycycline is tetracycline antibiotics broadly used systemically to treat inflammatory dermatologic conditions. Several studies have shown doxycycline has anti-inflammatory and pro-healing properties, mainly by blocking tissue proteolytic activity. It is our hypothesis that daily application of a novel doxycycline topical formulation in AD subjects will reduce severity of the disease, by blocking cutaneous proteases activity and restoring skin barrier function and inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we performed a proof of concept, open-label clinical study. Subjects enrolled in the study (n = 15) applied NanoDOX "
"Abstract: Near UV (λ = 320-400 nm) and visible light (λ = 400-800 nm) can lead to the oxidation of pharmaceutical proteins, which can affect efficiency and promote immunogenicity. However, no concise mechanism has been established for the photo-oxidation of pharmaceutical proteins under near UV and visible light. Here, we show that carboxylic acid buffer-Fe "
"Abstract: The Expert Panel for Cosmetic Ingredient Safety (Panel) assessed the safety of 60 PEGylated alkyl glycerides. PEGylated alkyl glycerides are mono-, di-, and/or triglycerides that have been modified with ethylene glycol repeat units (in the starting material form as epoxide). Most of the PEGylated alkyl glycerides are reported to function as skin-conditioning agents or surfactants. The Panel reviewed the available animal and clinical data as well as data from the 1999 report for the 5 polyethylene glycol (PEG) glyceryl cocoates and the 2012 report of PEGylated oils, to determine the safety of these ingredients. The Panel concluded these ingredients are safe in the current practices of use and concentration when formulated to be nonirritating; this conclusion supersedes the 1999 conclusion issued on 5 PEG glyceryl cocoate ingredients.

"BACKGROUND: Sunlight exposure causes several types of health issues to humans, and in particular, it affects especially the skin. Among the most common harmful issues developed by UV exposure are erythema, pigmentation, and lesions in DNA, which may lead to cancer. These long-term effects can be minimized with the use of sunscreen. OBJECTIVE: The use of commercial UV filters causes severe side effects such as skin allergy and whitening of the skin. Therefore, in this study the effectiveness of Ca METHOD: The comparative study of a cosmetic formulation having 5% Ca RESULT: The zeta potential and chemical stability of formulations containing these different UV filters were investigated by using UV-Vis spectroscopy, FTIR-ATR, and X-ray diffraction.

"BACKGROUND: Psoriasis vulgaris is commonly treated with topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogues. Although potent and super-potent topical corticosteroids are very effective at clearing psoriasis, with short-term reactive treatment durations, symptoms usually recur after treatment discontinuation, necessitating long-term disease management strategies. A foam formulation of calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate (Cal/BD foam), consisting of calcipotriol 50 μg/g and betamethasone dipropionate 0.5 mg/g, is approved for the daily treatment of psoriasis for up to 4 weeks. Here, we describe a clinical trial protocol for evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of twice-weekly Cal/BD foam as a proactive topical maintenance therapy for plaque psoriasis for up to 52 weeks. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this trial was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cal/BD foam when applied twice weekly for up to 52 weeks as proactive maintenance therapy, with the goal of preventing or delaying disease relapse as long as possible while minimizing adverse effects. METHODS: Once-daily Cal/BD foam treatment responders from an initial 4-week open-label period were randomized to receive Cal/BD foam or foam vehicle applied to previously cleared plaques twice weekly for up to 52 weeks. In case of relapse, affected subjects in either group received rescue therapy with once-daily Cal/BD foam for 4 weeks on active areas. Thus, the trial (NCT02899962) compared the long-term use of Cal/BD foam in a proactive approach with a conventional, reactive approach. PLANNED OUTCOMES: Efficacy endpoints included the time to first relapse, the number of relapse-free days, and the number of relapses during the maintenance phase. Safety assessments included adverse events, incidence of rebound, local safety and tolerability scores, and effects on calcium metabolism and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT02899962. "
"BACKGROUND: Infliximab (IFX), a TNF-α blocking chimeric monoclonal antibody, induces clinical response and mucosal healing in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, systemic administration of this agent causes unwanted side effects. Oral delivery of antibody therapeutics might be an effective treatment strategy for IBD compared to intravenous administration. RESULTS: All three carriers had a high encapsulation efficiency, narrow size distribution, and minimal systemic exposure. There was a higher interaction between nanocomposite carriers and monocytes compared to lymphocytes in the PBMC of IBD patients. Orally administered nanocomposite carriers targeted to inflamed colitis minimized systemic exposure. All IFX delivery formulations with nanocomposite carriers had a significantly less colitis-induced body weight loss, colon shortening and histomorphological score, compared to the DSS-treated group. AC-IFX-L and EAC-IFX-L groups showed significantly higher improvement of the disease activity index, compared to the DSS-treated group. In addition, AC-IFX-L and EAC-IFX-L alleviated pro-inflammatory cytokine expressions (Tnfa, Il1b, and Il17). CONCLUSION: We present orally administered antibody delivery systems which improved efficacy in murine colitis while reducing systemic exposure. These oral delivery systems suggest a promising therapeutic approach for treating IBD. "
"Abstract: Acne vulgaris (acne) is the most common dermatologic disorder seen in black patients. However, data are lacking on the effects of treatments, such as topical retinoids. Acne in black patients is frequently associated with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), which can be of greater concern than the patient's acne and often is the main reason these patients seek a dermatologist consultation. Retinoids can treat both acne and PIH. However, the potential for retinoids to induce an irritant contact dermatitis, which could lead to PIH, is a concern. A lotion formulation of tretinoin was developed to provide an important alternative option to treat acne in black patients who may be sensitive to the irritant effects of other tretinoin formulations or where PIH is a concern.

"BACKGROUND: Grape seed extract (GSE) is rich in polyphenolic compounds, particularly (+)-catechin (C) and (-)-epicatechin (EC). Strong antioxidant activity of these compounds makes GSE to be value-added to the cosmetics with anti-aging properties. However, a lack of stability in different environmental conditions makes GSE challenging for the development of photostable cosmetic sunscreen products. AIMS: To evaluate photoprotective effects of GSE on human dermal fibroblasts irradiated with UVA light and assess photostability of catechins in cream formulations containing GSE alone or in combination with octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC). METHODS: MTT assay was used to assess protective effects of GSE on fibroblasts irradiated with UVA light. A photostability of C and EC in GSE and in cream formulation containing GSE was investigated using high-performance liquid chromatography and confirmed by reflection and transmission spectrophotometry using Transpore™ tapes and polymethacrylate (PMMA) plates as substrates. RESULTS: High UVA doses damaged fibroblast structure and inhibited their growth. However, GSE increased cell viability and effectively protected them from UVA damage. Photostability of C and EC was achieved by combination of GSE and OMC that also improved absorption capacity of UV filter and increased overall efficacy of formulation. PMMA plates showed better applicability for in vitro photostability testing of sunscreen formulations. However, despite the instability of Transpore® tape under heat from UV exposure, it can still be economically a substrate of alternative choice for screening. CONCLUSIONS: GSE can be used as an effective and sustainable natural resource for prevention of UV-induced skin damage providing long-term protection against premature skin aging. "
"Abstract: There are several drawbacks with the current commercially available ultraviolet (UV) filters used in sunscreen formulations, namely deleterious human and ecotoxic effects. As a result of the drawbacks, a current research interest is in identifying and designing new UV filters. One approach that has been explored in recent years is to use nature as inspiration, which is the focus of this review. Both plants and microorganisms have adapted to synthesize their own photoprotective molecules to guard their DNA from potentially harmful UV radiation. The relaxation mechanism of a molecule after it has been photoexcited can be unravelled by several techniques, the ones of most interest for this review being ultrafast spectroscopy and computational methods. Within the literature, both techniques have been implemented on plant-, and microbial-inspired UV filters to better understand their photoprotective roles in nature. This review aims to explore these findings for both families of nature-inspired UV filters in the hope of guiding the future design of sunscreens. "
"Abstract: Adapalene (ADP) is a representative of the third retinoids generation and successfully used in first-line acne treatment. ADP binds to retinoic acid nuclear receptors. The comedolytic, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory are the known ADP effects. Its safety profile is an advantage over other retinoids. ADP recently was found to be effective in the treatment of several dermatological diseases and photoaging besides the utility in the treatment of acne vulgaris. New biological effects of adapalene with therapeutic potential are highlighted in this review paper. Thus, adapalene could be a valuable therapeutic drug into the treatment of several types of cancer. Additionally, some neurodegenerative diseases could be treated with a suitable formulation for intravenous administration. The antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant  "
"Abstract: Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common dermatologic disease that seriously affects patient quality of life. The choice of therapy to control the disease and prevent its recurrence has always presented a difficult clinical issue. Previous studies have shown that traditional Chinese medicine is a safe and effective treatment for CSU. Recently, the temporal rhythms of CSU, a disease characterized by intermittent flares of active disease and periods of little or no disease, have attracted the attention of traditional Chinese medicine researchers. We designed a multicenter, randomized, controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combining a Chinese herbal formulation with acupuncture using shu-stream acupoints applied on the corresponding time meridians during disease exacerbations. We plan to recruit 111 outpatients with CSU aged 18 to 65 years. Participants will be randomized to 1 of the 3 groups: group A, which will be given basic acupuncture and the herbal formulation dangui yinzi; group B, which will be given danggui yinzi and shu-stream acupuncture; and a control group, which will be given danggui yinzi alone. Patients will be treated for 4 weeks and followed for 8 additional weeks. Investigators will evaluate the following parameters: the symptoms and side effects of treatment, quality of life (using the chronic urticaria quality of life questionnaire), and overall patient condition. Each week, patients will also complete the measurement of 7-day urticarial activity score. This is the first use of a combination of shu-stream acupoints and Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of CSU. If successful, it will prove to be a simple, inexpensive, treatment strategy for solving a difficult clinical problem. "
"BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris is a common and chronic skin disease that impacts on physical and psychological perceptions. Combination therapy with topical retinoids and antimicrobial agent is considered the preferred approach for most of the subjects affected by mild-to-moderate acne. A correct therapeutic management should include a prolonged treatment to ensure therapeutic success and to prevent recurrences. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a new topical gel formulation that combines retinol encapsulated in glycospheres and hydroxypinacolone retinoate, associated with an anti-microbial peptide (BIOPEP-15) salicylic acid, glycolic acid, and niacinamide as monotherapy in mild acne vulgaris. METHODS: A 2-month prospective study was conducted at the Unit of Dermatology of the Federico II University. Twenty-five patients aged from 14 to 30 years with mild acne of the face (GAGS score ≤ 18) were consecutively enrolled. Each patient was asked to apply the gel formulation once daily in the evening for 8 weeks. The number of acne lesions with VISIA camera system, the global acne grading system (GAGS) score, trans epidermal water loss (TEWL), skin colorimetry (X-rite Spectrocolorimeter), reflectance confocal microscopy exam were evaluated at baseline, after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment for each patient. Tolerability and safety of the product were also evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-five female patients with a median age of 23.4 were enrolled. Twenty-two (88%) completed the 2-month treatment period visits. At baseline the total acne lesion number, mean (SD), was 5.5 (4) and the GAG score 9 (4). A significant (P=0.001) reduction in number of total acne lesions was observed at week 4 (-57%) and at week 8 (-80%). All patients presented a significant reduction of the GAGS score values: -42% at week 4 and -78% at week 8, confirming the clinical efficacy of the product. At baseline TEWL was 10.2 g/m CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide favorable evidences of the efficacy and safety of this new product as a first line treatment in patients with mild acne, or, as a maintenance therapy for prolonged periods after the suspension of a systemic treatment. Furthermore, the tolerability of this topical product and the absence of any side effects increased the adherence to the therapy. "
"Abstract: Malignant melanoma is an emerging problem worldwide due to the high degree of lethalness. Its aggressiveness and the ability to metastasize along with the heterogeneity at the molecular and cellular levels, limit the overall therapeutic efficacy. Despite significant advances in melanoma treatment over the last decade, there is still a need for improved therapeutic modalities. Thus, we demonstrate here a combinatorial approach that targets multiple independent therapeutic pathways, in which polymeric micelles (PMs) were used as efficacious colloidal nanocarriers loaded with both daunorubicin (DRB) as a cytotoxic drug and IR-768 as a photosensitizer. This afforded the dual drug loaded delivery system IR-768 + DRB in PMs. The fabricated mPEG-b-PLGA micelles (hydrodynamic diameters ≈ 25 nm) had a relatively narrow size distribution (PdI > ca. 0.3) with uniform spherical shapes. CLSM study showed that mPEG-b-PLGA micelles were uptaken by mitochondria, which further contributed to excellent singlet oxygen generation capacity for PDT in A375 melanoma cells. Furthermore, the PMs were efficiently internalized by tested cells through endocytosis, resulting in much higher cellular uptake comparing to the free drug. As a result of these properties, IR-768 + DRB in PMs exhibited very potent and synergistically enhanced anticancer activity against A375 cells. Additionally, this combination approach allowed to reduce drug doses and provided low side effects towards normal HaCaT. This study indicates excellent properties of mPEG-b-PLGA micelles resulting in great therapeutic potential possessed by the developed nanoscale drug delivery system for combined chemo-photodynamic therapy of melanoma.

"BACKGROUND: The growing need to use sunscreens is a concrete reality, and it is associated with the increase in the population's awareness of the ultraviolet (UV) radiation damage. Inorganic UV filters promote the formation of particles/pigments film over the skin surface, reflecting, dispersing, and absorbing the radiation. Investigations of this class of filters demonstrate the emergence of alternative ingredients and new technologies. AIMS AND METHODS: In this review, we presented potential candidates for alternative UV inorganic filters, such as hydroxyapatite, cerium dioxide, and hydrotalcite. RESULTS: Specialized literature identified hydroxyapatite and cerium dioxide as actives with good performances, with a broad spectrum of absorption against UV radiation. Both of them were considered safe against degradation and skin erythema formation. Inorganic compounds as an alternative to circumvent degradation problems of organic UV filters containing PABA were also analyzed, with hydrotalcite having a good performance in improving the performance of classic ingredients, bypassing photoinstability, and improving safety, in addition to preventing skin irritability. CONCLUSION: Further investigations of these ingredients and interactions with sunscreen formulations are necessary to overall explore their safety and efficacy, encouraging future researches for more inorganic UV filters.

"BACKGROUND: Untreated antenatal depression and anxiety can be associated with short and long term health impacts on the pregnant woman, her infant and the rest of the family. Alternative interventions to those currently available are needed. This clinical trial aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of a broad-spectrum multinutrient formula as a treatment for symptoms of depression and anxiety in pregnant women and to determine the impact supplementation has on the general health and development of the infant. METHODS: This randomised, controlled trial will be conducted in Canterbury, New Zealand between April 2017 and June 2022. One hundred and twenty women aged over 16 years, between 12 and 24 weeks gestation and who score ≥ 13 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) will be randomly assigned to take the intervention (n = 60) or an active control formula containing iodine and riboflavin (n = 60) for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, participants can enter an open-label phase until the birth of their infant and naturalistically followed for the first 12 months postpartum. Infants will be followed until 12 months of age. Randomisation will be computer-generated, with allocation concealment by opaque sequentially numbered envelopes. Participants and the research team including data analysts will be blinded to group assignment. The EPDS and the Clinical Global Impressions Scale of Improvement (CGI-I) will be the maternal primary outcome measures of this study and will assess the incidence of depression and anxiety and the improvement of symptomatology respectively. Generalized linear mixed effects regression models will analyse statistical differences between the multinutrient and active control group on an intent-to-treat basis. A minimum of a three-point difference in EPDS scores between the groups will identify clinical significance. Pregnancy outcomes, adverse events and side effects will also be monitored and reported. DISCUSSION: Should the multinutrient formula be shown to be beneficial for both the mother and the infant, then an alternative treatment option that may also improve the biopsychosocial development of their infants can be provided for pregnant women experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial ID: ACTRN12617000354381 ; prospectively registered at Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry on 08/03/2017. "
"Abstract: Rosacea is a very common chronic facial dermatosis characterized by a multiphase evolution. Inflammation is an important reaction in rosacea not only due to inflammatory reactions to cutaneous microorganisms, such as Demodex follicolorum, but also to ultraviolet damage that generates reactive oxygen species. This study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 18-beta glycyrrhetinic acid cream for the treatment of mild rosacea by means of noninvasive methods. A total of 24 subjects suffering from erythemato-telangiectatic or mild papulo-pustular rosacea were recruited in the trial. Twelve patients applied an anti-inflammatory cream with 18-beta glycyrrhetinic acid twice daily for 20 days and 12 patients, recruited as control, applied the same formulation without 18-beta glycyrrhetinic acid. After 10 days of treatment, a significant reduction of erythema was recorded in the patient sample who applied the 18-beta glycyrrhetinic acid cream, the mean change from baseline showed an increase in hydration level of the skin surface but it was not statistically significant. The use of 18-beta glycyrrhetinic acid cream can be helpful in managing symptoms and condition of rosacea skin, especially in the management of erythema. "
"PURPOSE: To evaluate the riboflavin (RF) concentration and distribution in the corneal stroma and the risk for endothelial photodamage during corneal crosslinking (CXL) following 10- and 30-minute impregnation. METHODS: De-epithelialized rabbit corneas were subjected to impregnation for 10 and 30 minutes with different RF formulations. Human corneal endothelial cells (HCECs) were subjected to different RF concentrations and ultraviolet A (UVA) dosages. Assays included fluorescence imaging, absorption spectroscopy of corneal buttons and anterior chamber humor, and cell viability staining. RESULTS: After 10 and 30 minutes of impregnation, respectively, anterior chamber fluid showed an RF concentration of (1.6 ± 0.21)•10 CONCLUSIONS: The risk for endothelial damage in CXL by RF/UVA treatment does not increase by shortened impregnation because the 30% increase in light intensity is accompanied by a 3.4-fold decrease of the RF concentration in the posterior stroma. This is substantiated by similar endothelial cell toxicity seen in vitro, which in fact appears to favor 10-minute impregnation. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: This study offers compelling arguments for (safely) shortening RF impregnation duration, reducing patients' burden and costly operation room time. "
"Abstract: Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin, which is characterized by itching, erythema, and eczematous lacerations. It affects about 10 % of adults and approximately 15-20 % of children worldwide. As a result of genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors, the disease manifests itself with the impaired stratum corneum barrier and then immunological responses. Topical administration of corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors are currently used as the first strategy in the management of the disease. However, they have low skin bioavailability and some side effects. The nanocarriers as novel drug delivery systems could overcome limitations of conventional dosage forms, owing to increment of poorly soluble drug' solubility, then its thermodynamic activity and, consequently, its skin permeation. Also, side effects of the drug substances on the skin could be reduced by the nano-sized drug delivery systems due to encapsulation of the drug in the nanocarriers and targeted drug delivery of drug substances to the inflammated skin areas. Thereby, there have been available numerous research studies and patents regarding the use of nanocarriers in the management of atopic dermatitis. This review focuses on the mechanism of disease and development of nanocarrier based on novel drug release systems in the management of atopic dermatitis. "
"Abstract: Methotrexate (MTX), an anti-neoplastic agent used for breast cancer treatment, has restricted clinical applications due to poor water solubility, non-specific targeting and adverse side effects. To overcome these limitations, MTX was co-encapsulated with an active-targeting platform known as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) in a lipid-based homing system, nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC). This multi-modal therapeutic regime was successfully formulated with good colloidal stability, bio- and hemo-compatibility. MTX-SPIONs co-loaded NLC was time-dependent cytotoxic towards MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line with IC "
"INTRODUCTION: Biologic drugs have significantly improved the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). However, the availability of these drugs is limited by their high cost. Infliximab was the first biologic to be approved for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). After its patent expired other manufactures developed biosimilar versions, among which CT-P13, and licensed them thorough an expedite process. AREAS COVERED: The aim of this review is to summarize the available evidence on CT-P13 use in IBD, with particular interest in the phase II trials of a subcutaneous version of CT-P13. EXPERT OPINION: Biosimilars, such as CT-P13, are an important resource for health-care systems. Although CT-P13 approval in IBD was based on extrapolation, subsequent studies confirmed its clinical equivalence to originator infliximab. A new subcutaneous formulation of CT-P13 showed promising results in phase I and II trials in both CD and UC. Clinical efficacy and safety were comparable and interestingly serum drug doses appeared to be more stable than conventional intravenous CT-P13. If these preliminary results will be confirmed, the first sub-cutaneous version of infliximab could soon be available for IBD. "
"Abstract: Acidic environments, such as in inflamed tissues, favor the charged form of local anesthetics (LA). Hence, these drugs show less cell permeation and diminished potency. Since the analgesic capsaicin (CAP) triggers opening of the TRPV1 receptor pore, its combination with LAs could result in better uptake and improved anesthesia. We tested the above hypothesis and report here for the first time the analgesia effect of a two-drug combination (LA and CAP) on an inflamed tissue. First, CAP solubility increased up to 20 times with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD), as shown by the phase solubility study. The resulting complex (HP-β-CD-CAP) showed 1:1 stoichiometry and high association constant, according to phase-solubility diagrams and isothermal titration calorimetry data. The inclusion complex formation was also confirmed and characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction, and  "
"BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is a water-insoluble, anti-tumor agent that causes adverse effects like bone marrow suppression, chronic interstitial obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatotoxicity, leukopenia, interstitial pneumonitis and nephrotoxicity with slow drug release rate. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to successfully incorporate MTX into novel-targeted Pluronic (PEOPPO- PEO tri-block co-polymer) F127 polymeric micelles intended for intravenous administration with improved drug loading and sustained release behavior necessary to achieve better efficacy of MTX. METHODS: MTX-loaded Pluronic F127 micelles were characterized for critical micelle concentration, particle size and zeta potential, RESULTS: The micellar formulation resulted in nano size 27.32±1.43nm of PF127/SDS, as compared to Pluronic F127 micelles or PF127/Phosphatidyl choline which were 30.52±1.18nm and 154.35±5.5nm in size, respectively. The uptake of PF127/SDS micellar formulation incorporating Rhodamine 123 in MCF7 cancer cells was found to be higher (84.25%) than PF127/PC, PF127 and MTX i.e. 66.26%, 73.59% and 53% respectively. The in vitro MTX release from PF127, PF127/SDS and PF127/PC polymeric micelles formulations was observed to be 69%, 69.5% and 66% at 12 h whereas 80.89%, 77.67% and 78.54% after 24 h, respectively and revealed a sustained release. MTX-loaded PF127/SDS micelles showed high partition coefficient and negative free energy of solubilization compared to PF127 and PF127/PC which signify self-assembly behavior and thermodynamic stability towards higher dissociation. CONCLUSION: It was finally concluded that MTX-loaded PF127/SDS micelles act as a potential anticancer delivery system in comparison to PF127/PC and PF127 to combat tumor cells by enhancing their cellular uptake targeting with sustained release pattern and reducing the thermodynamic instability. Thus, PF127/SDS micellar formulation can provide a useful alternative dosage form for intravenous administration of MTX. "
"OBJECTIVE: There is uncertainty around preoperative skin antisepsis in clean surgery. Network meta-analysis provides more precise estimates than standard pairwise meta-analysis and can rank interventions by efficacy, to better inform clinical decisions. BACKGROUND: Infection is the most common and costly complication of surgery. The relative efficacy of CHG and PVI based skin antiseptics in clean surgery remains unclear. METHODS: We searched for randomized or nonrandomized studies comparing the effect of different preparations of CHG and PVI on the dichotomous outcome of surgical site infection. We included studies of adults undergoing clean surgery. We excluded studies concerning indwelling vascular catheters, blood sampling, combination antiseptics or sequential applications of different antiseptics. We performed a network meta-analysis to estimate the relative efficacy of interventions using relative risks (RR). RESULTS: We included 17 studies comparing 5 antiseptics in 14,593 individuals. The overall rate of surgical site infection was 3%. Alcoholic CHG 4%-5% was ranked as the most effective antiseptic as it halved the risk of surgical site infection when compared to aqueous PVI [RR 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.24, 1.02)] and also to alcoholic PVI, although uncertainty was larger [RR 0.51 (95% confidence interval 0.21, 1.27)]. Adverse events related to antiseptic application were only observed with patients exposed to PVI. CONCLUSIONS: Alcoholic formulations of 4%-5% CHG seem to be safe and twice as effective as PVI (alcoholic or aqueous solutions) in preventing infection after clean surgery in adults. Our findings concur with the literature on contaminated and clean-contaminated surgery, and endorse guidelines worldwide which advocate the use of alcoholic CHG for preoperative skin antisepsis.

"INTRODUCTION: Methotrexate exhibits poor cutaneous bioavailability and systemic side effects on topical administration, so there is an unmet need for a novel carrier and its optimized therapy. Methotrexate-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers (MTXNLCs) were formulated and characterized to determine in vitro drug release and evaluate the role of MTXNLC gel in the topical treatment of psoriasis. METHODS: A solvent diffusion technique was employed to prepare MTXNLCs, which was optimized using 3 RESULTS: The optimized MTXNLCs were rod-shaped, with an average particle size of 253 ± 8.65 nm, a zeta potential of -26.4±0.86 mV, and EE of 54.00±1.49%. DSC and XRD data confirmed the formation of NLCs. Significantly higher deposition of MTX was found in HCS from MTXNLC gel (71.52 ±1.13%) as compared to MTX plain gel (38.48±0.96%). In vivo studies demonstrated significant improvement in therapeutic response and reduction in local side effects with MTXNLCs-loaded gel in the topical treatment of psoriasis. Anti-psoriatic efficacy of MTXNLCs 100 ug/cm CONCLUSION: Developed formulation of MTXNLC gel demonstrated better anti-psoriatic activity and also displayed prolonged and sustained release effect, which shows that it can be a promising alternative to existing MTX formulation for the treatment of psoriasis.

"Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of a topical antioxidant and ultraviolet (UV) shielding action formulation containing riboflavin and D-α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) vitamin E against corneal UV-induced damage in vivo rabbit eyes. In vivo experiments were performed using male albino rabbits, which were divided into four groups. The control group (CG) did not receive any UV irradiation; the first group (IG) was irradiated with a UV-B-UV-A lamp for 30 min; the second (G30) and third (G60) groups received UV irradiation for 30 and 60 min, respectively, and were topically treated with one drop of the antioxidant and shielding formulation every 15 min, starting one hour before irradiation, until the end of UV exposure. The cornea of the IG group showed irregular thickening, detachment of residual fragments of the Descemet membrane, stromal fluid swelling with consequent collagen fiber disorganization and disruption, and inflammation. The cornea of the G30 group showed edema, a mild thickening of the Descemet membrane without fibrillar collagen disruption and focal discoloration, or inflammation. In the G60 group, the cornea showed a more severe thickening, a more abundant fluid accumulation underneath the Descemet membrane with focal detachment, and no signs of severe tissue alterations, as were recorded in the IG group. Our results demonstrate that topical application of eye drops containing riboflavin and TPGS vitamin E counteracts UV corneal injury in exposed rabbits. "
"Abstract: Psoriasis is one of the most common human skin disorders. Although its pathogenesis is complex and not completely know, the hyperactivation of the immune system seem to have a key role. In this regard, among the most effective systemic therapeutics used in psoriasis, we find cyclosporine, an immunosuppressive medication. However, one of the major problems associated with the use of cyclosporine is the occurrence of systemic side effects such as nephrotoxicity, hypertension, etc. The present work fits in this context and its aim is the design of suitable platforms for cyclosporine topical release in psoriasis treatment. The main objective is to achieve local administration of cyclosporine in order to reduce its systemic absorption and, consequently, its side effects. In order to improve dermal penetration, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are used as carriers, due to their lipophilicity and occlusive properties, and naringenin and linolenic acid are chosen, due to their properties, as starting materials for SLNs design. In order to have dermatological formulations and further modulate drug release, SLNs are incorporated in several topical vehicles obtaining gels with different degree of lipophilicity. Potential applications for psoriasis treatment were evaluated by considering the encapsulation efficiency, release profiles, in vitro skin permeation, and anti-inflammatory effects. "
"Abstract: Transdermal application of analgesics allows efficient and painless delivery of medication with minimum side effect. This study was designed with the aim to formulate and characterize dexibuprofen-capsaicin emulgel for transdermal drug delivery with improved anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. The emulgel was prepared and evaluated for physical examination, stability, spreadability, rheological behavior, viscosity, drug content determination, FTIR analysis, and ex vivo studies. Anti-inflammatory (carrageenan-induced paw edema) and analgesic (hot plate latency test) effects were determined in Sprague-Dawley rats. The dexibuprofen-capsaicin emulgel showed good physical appearance and stability having average pH 5.5 to 6.0, conductivity 73-76 s/m, spreadability (12-)17 g cm/s, drug content 102.84% ± 0.53 (for capsaicin) and 94.09% ± 0.41 (for dexibuprofen), and FTIR compatibility. It was noted that 86.956% ± 1.46 (with 100 mg menthol), 76.687% ± 1.21 (75 mg menthol), and 65.543% ± 1.71 (without menthol) of capsaicin were released. Similarly 81.342% ± 1.21 (with 100 mg menthol), 72.321% ± 1.31 (75 mg menthol), and 52.462% ± 1.23 (without menthol) of dexibuprofen were released. The cumulative amount of capsaicin permeated through rabbit skin was 9.83 ± 0.037 μg/cm "
"Abstract: Benzophenones (BPs) are a group of chemically similar organic compounds commonly used in formulations of sunscreen and other personal care products as UV filters to protect our skin against sunlight overexposure. Studies have shown that the occurrence of certain BPs (e.g., BP-3 and its metabolite BP-1) in multiple environmental matrices may increase the incidence of coral planulae bleaching and estrogenic effects on aquatic life. Currently, most BPs are not yet comprehensively screened in vitro and in vivo for their ecotoxicity under environmentally relevant concentrations. This study systematically assessed the in vitro and in vivo toxicity and activity of the 7 most commonly used BPs (BP-1, BP-2, BP-3, BP-4, BP-6, BP-7 and BP-8) to select BP alternatives with lower ecotoxicity and extra beneficial functions. BP-2 (LC "

"BACKGROUND: The recommended amount of sunscreen by hand application (2 mg/cm MATERIALS AND METHODS: The homogeneity of sunscreen applied by a newly developed spray applicator using an electrostatically charged aerosol, for which a hand rubbing of the formulation is not necessary, is evaluated. In vivo experiments were performed on the volar forearms of human volunteers using the spray applicator compared to the standardized hand application according to ISO 24444. RESULTS: The distribution homogeneity was assessed qualitatively using in vivo laser scanning microscopy and quantitatively by absorption spectroscopy after tape stripping and by the standard deviation of multiple spatially displaced reflectance measurements for non-invasive SPF determination below the minimal erythemal dose, which showed a significantly higher homogeneity by 20.9% after spray application compared to hand application. CONCLUSION: Non-invasive SPF determination of multiple spatially displaced reflectance measurements was proven to be a suitable method for the non-invasive determination of the sunscreen distribution homogeneity. Electrostatically charged spray application increased the sunscreen distribution homogeneity on the skin and can reduce the amount of overspray. "
"PURPOSE: Adapalene (AD) is one of the main retinoids used in the topical therapy of acne, an extremely common skin disease usually associated with psychological morbidity. However, like other retinoids, AD is frequently associated with skin irritation. To overcome the skin irritation, we proposed the encapsulation of AD in solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) using the ion pair strategy. METHODS: The developed SLN-AD was characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. In vitro permeation tests using porcine skin and in vivo mice skin irritation test were performed to evaluate, respectively, the drug's skin distribution and the skin irritation. RESULTS: The characterization studies were able to demonstrate that the proposed strategy effectively provided high AD encapsulation in SLNs and its incorporation into a hydrophilic gel. Sustained release, epidermal targeting, and less skin irritation were observed for SLN-AD gel in comparison to the marketed AD gel. CONCLUSIONS: The studies demonstrated that the encapsulation of AD in SLNs through the formation of an ion pair is a valuable alternative to diminish the adverse skin reactions caused by AD and can optimize patient adherence to treatment.

"Abstract: Trans-resveratrol becomes more and more popular all over the world as a powerful antioxidant. Since its positive properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor are indisputable, nowadays trans-resveratrol is used as a component of various products from nutriceutics to body care formulations, where it is supposed to behave as natural antioxidant and anti-aging compound. It is also added to food packaging materials to increase their stability or/and prevent oxidation. Nevertheless, being released to the environment resveratrol easily forms various transformation products with potentially negative environmental and health effects. The present paper deals with transformation of pure resveratrol and its formulation used as UV-protectors in conditions of aquatic chlorination. Over 80 transformation products were tentatively identified using gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) and ultra pressure liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS). Chlorinated phenols and biphenyls are the most relevant among them. Estimation of toxicity of resveratrol products was carried out using luminescent bacteria V. fischeri tests. "
"Abstract: Nowadays, non-biological treatments remain valuable approaches among the therapeutic armamentarium of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Mesalamine is the core treatment of mild‑to‑moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) and corticosteroids are crucial for the induction of remission of moderate‑to‑severe flares in both UC and Crohn's disease (CD). Even approaches as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, azathioprine, methotrexate, and surgery still have a nuclear position as strategies to induce and/or maintain remission in IBD. Due to their particularities and to the accumulated evidence, each of these strategies conquered peculiar roles in the overall IBD strategy, all of them contributing to better outcomes. This review emphasizes the particular roles that non-biological treatments gained over time: recent mesalamine formulations to increase adhesion rates, higher doses of 5-ASA for high-risk patients, MMX technology to improve drug release and attain higher bowel concentrations, cyclosporine as a bridge to vedolizumab, tacrolimus as a potential alternative to thiopurines or infliximab, azathioprine in combination therapy with infliximab and dubious in monotherapy, and surgery as a mean to a ""better end"".

"BACKGROUND: The use of sunscreens is mandatory, especially in countries with high ultraviolet (UV) incidence. In consequence, there has been a growing interest in using compounds from natural sources to develop new multifunctional products that protect human skin from the consequences of UV exposition. Even though there are in vitro methods to determine anti-UV efficacy, it is still required to test photoprotection activity on human skin to validate product performance. AIM AND METHODS: In this review, we summarized all reported clinical studies about sun protection factor (SPF) measurements of sunscreens with natural compounds. We also discussed the probable action mechanism of those actives. RESULTS: Herein, we provided an overview on recent studies concerning photoprotection activity of compounds from natural sources, for example, rutin, ferulic acid, caffeine, shea butter, and plant extracts, mainly presented in sunscreen systems with efficacy clinically established by SPF. CONCLUSION: Our review suggested that even when the in vivo SPF evaluation has inherent difficulties, it is essential to assure the real efficacy of sunscreens. Furthermore, the incorporation of natural compounds could enhance the in vivo SPF values of such sunscreens by different mechanisms. Finally, some compounds derived from natural resources with skin benefits could be used as ""green""/natural UV filters that provide broad-spectrum sunscreens with further upgrading of the multifunctional dermocosmetic formulation to enhance aesthetics and even skin health.

"Abstract: Sunscreens are an important tool used to protect the skin against harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Many different formulations of sunscreen exist today, which can be confusing to the consumer. In this article, we highlight and address many sunscreen myths that exist today including the benefits of higher SPF sunscreen, use of sunscreen in darker skin types, and the effects of sunscreen on vitamin D production.

"BACKGROUND: Monomethyl fumarate (MMF) is the pharmacologically active metabolite of dimethyl fumarate (DMF). MMF formulated as Bafiertam™ 190 mg and DMF formulated as Tecfidera 240 mg deliver bioequivalent exposure of MMF and therefore possess the same efficacy/safety profiles. DMF is a widely used oral treatment for relapsing-remitting forms of multiple sclerosis (RRMS) but is limited in some patients, primarily female, by issues with gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, head-to-head, 5-week study evaluating the GI tolerability of MMF 190 mg vs DMF 240 mg, administered twice daily in healthy subjects, using a derivative of the self-administered Modified Overall Gastrointestinal Symptom Scale (MOGISS). Subjects were stratified (3:1, female:male) and randomized (1:1) to the treatments. The primary endpoint was the Area Under the Curve (AUC) in each of the individual symptoms in the MOGISS over the 5-week treatment period. Other endpoints included the AUC over the 5-week treatment period in the MOGISS composite and total scores; duration and severity of GI events; Number and percentage of subjects reporting GI events during the overall treatment period, and assessment of safety/tolerability. RESULTS: Inferential analysis of the hierarchical testing of overall treatment differences in each MOGISS symptom AUC occurred in a predefined sequence starting with Abdominal Pain. For each symptom, LSMean AUC values were lower for MMF than DMF, however, the first primary endpoint, Abdominal Pain, was not statistically different between treatments; thus, all subsequent statistical analyses were considered exploratory. The side effects and safety profiles observed were consistent with the known profiles of DMF, with no new or unique safety concerns noted. CONCLUSIONS: Bafiertam showed an improved gastrointestinal tolerability profile compared with Tecfidera, with less severe GI events and fewer days of self-assessed GI symptoms, fewer GI adverse events, and lower discontinuation rates because of GI adverse events.

"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Nanoparticles are used in cosmetic and dermatologic products, due to better skin penetration properties. Incorporation of natural products exhibiting medicinal properties in nano-preparations could significantly improve the efficacy of these products and improve the quality of life without the side effects of synthetic formulations. METHODS: We here report the green synthesis of Copper Oxide nanoparticles, using Cucumber extract, and their detailed bio-physical and bio-chemical characterization. RESULTS: These Copper Oxide-Cucumber nanoparticles exhibit significant anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties, Ultra Violet-radiation protection ability and reactive-oxygen species inhibition properties. Importantly, these nanoparticles do not exhibit significant cellular toxicity and, when incorporated in skin cream, exhibit skin rejuvenating properties. CONCLUSION: Our findings have implications for nanoparticle-based cosmetics and dermatologic applications. "
"OBJECTIVE: This proof-of-concept study demonstrated that using minimally invasive skin microsampling could enable significantly higher throughput of cosmetic testing in volunteers than conventional biopsy. Nanoparticle sunscreen was used as a model to test toxicity based on oxidative stress using microbiopsy and confocal imaging. METHODS: Six volunteers were recruited for this study (3 males and 3 females). Zinc oxide nanoparticle containing topical formulation was prepared at 10% w/v. Each volunteer had 3 areas of 4 cm RESULTS: Skin exposed to zinc oxide nanoparticles did not show any significant increases in oxidative stress. Zinc oxide nanoparticle tape-stripped skin resulted in signal significantly lower (P < 0.001) oxidative stress levels than t-butylated hydroxytoluene treated tape-stripped skin for oxidative stress markers. Topically applied zinc oxide nanoparticles had no detectable effect on the oxidative status in volunteer skin. No adverse reactions or effects were observed after all treatments including microbiopsy. CONCLUSION: The data support the hypothesis that microbiopsy is a viable approach to study cosmeceutical- skin interactions in volunteers with capacity for molecular assays and high throughput with very low risk to the volunteer. OBJECTIFS: Cette étude de validation de concept a démontré que le microprélèvement cutané minimalement invasif pouvait augmenter considérablement la cadence des essais de produits cosmétiques sur des volontaires par rapport à une biopsie conventionnelle. Un écran solaire contenant des nanoparticules a été utilisé comme modèle pour tester la toxicité liée au stress oxydatif à l’aide de la microbiopsie et de l’imagerie confocale. MÉTHODES: Six volontaires ont été recrutés pour cette étude (3 hommes et 3 femmes). Une formulation topique contenant des nanoparticules d’oxyde de zinc a été préparée à 10 % p/v. Chaque volontaire disposait de 3 zones de 4 cm CONCLUSION: Les données obtenues étayent l’hypothèse selon laquelle la microbiopsie est une approche viable pour étudier les interactions des produits cosmétiques sur la peau des volontaires, avec la possibilité de réaliser des dosages moléculaires et à haut débit, avec un risque très faible pour les volontaires.

"Abstract: Compounding topical medications is a way for dermatologists to prescribe customized topical treatment options based on the individualized needs of patients. However, there are limited data on the safety of compounded medications and potential systemic absorption. Additionally, there also are limited data on the efficacy of compounded medications given their unique nature. "
"Abstract: Homosalate (HMS) is a salicylate molecule that is commonly included within commercial sunscreen formulations to provide protection from the adverse effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure. In the present work, the mechanisms by which HMS provides UV photoprotection are unravelled, using a multi-pronged approach involving a combination of time-resolved ultrafast laser spectroscopy in the gas-phase and in solution, laser-induced fluorescence, steady-state absorption spectroscopy, and computational methods. The unique combination of these techniques allow us to show that the enol tautomer of HMS undergoes ultrafast excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) upon photoexcitation in the UVB (290-320 nm) region; once in the keto tautomer, the excess energy is predominantly dissipated non-radiatively. Sharp transitions are observed in the LIF spectrum at close-to-origin excitation energies, which points towards the potential presence of a second conformer that does not undergo ESIPT. These studies demonstrate that, overall, HMS exhibits mostly favourable photophysical characteristics of a UV filter for inclusion in sunscreen formulations. "
"Abstract: Surgery combined with adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy is still the standard treatment for osteosarcoma. However, the high risk of tumor recurrence and side effects of chemotherapy usually lead to high mortality for cancer patients. Herein, the multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor sunitinib (Sun) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) drug chlorin e6 (Ce6) were locally delivered to the postoperative tumor site via a zwitterionic hydrogel. This hydrogel exhibited excellent biocompatibility and redox responsiveness. In vitro study demonstrated that Sun/Ce6@Gel induced 143B human osteosarcoma cell apoptosis via downregulating the expression of Bcl-2 and upregulating the expression levels of Bax and caspase-3. Similarly, the in vivo study showed that Sun/Ce6@Gel provided sustained drug release under redox conditions, and then synergistically induced tumor apoptosis to prevent tumor recurrence without systemic toxicity. Therefore, local implantation of Sun/Ce6@Gel may be a promising topical therapeutic method for prevention of the recurrence of osteosarcoma after surgery. "
"INTRODUCTION: Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is an immune-mediated, chronic inflammatory disorder of the esophagus. Topical steroids have been used in the management of EoE for over 15 years. However, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug therapies for EoE. AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the current understanding of EoE and the role of topical steroids in the induction and maintenance of remission in patients with EoE. We performed a comprehensive review of the literature, summarized randomized control trials from 2006 to 2020, and provided a simplified management algorithm for EoE. EXPERT OPINION: In patients with EoE, topical steroids are effective in inducing clinical and histologic remission. Formulations of topical steroids that maximize the exposure to esophageal mucosa have the highest efficacy. A majority of patients who achieve remission with topical steroids develop clinical and histologic relapse off therapy within a year. Current evidence suggests that maintenance therapy with long-term topical steroids decreases the risk of relapse and progression to fibrostenotic disease. While uncertainty over the dose and duration of maintenance topical steroids and their potential side effects exists, long-term maintenance therapy with topical steroids appears to be the way forward to improve long-term outcomes in patients with EoE.

"Abstract: Background: As current tazarotene formulations indicated for acne (0.1%) can cause irritation, a new tazarotene 0.045% lotion formu-lation was developed using polymeric emulsion technology. The objective was to assess efficacy, safety, and tolerability of tazarotene 0.045% lotion in patients with moderate-to-severe acne in a pooled analysis of data from two identical phase 3, double-blind, random-ized, vehicle-controlled 12-week clinical studies. Methods: Patients aged ≥9 years with moderate-to-severe acne were randomized (1:1) to tazarotene 0.045% lotion or vehicle lotion applied once daily. Inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts and Evaluator's Global Severity Score (EGSS) were assessed. Treatment success was defined as a ≥2-grade improvement in EGSS and a score of 'clear'/'almost clear'. Adverse events (AEs) and cutaneous safety and tolerability were also assessed. Results: In total, 1614 patients (mean age: 20.5 years) were randomized to tazarotene 0.045% lotion (n=799) or vehicle (n=815). At week 12, tazarotene 0.045% lotion demonstrated statistically significant superiority versus vehicle in reducing inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts (least-squares mean percent changes from baseline: inflammatory, -57.9% vs -47.8% [P<0.001]; noninflam-matory, -56.0% vs -42.0% [P<0.001]). Treatment success at week 12 was also greater with tazarotene 0.045% lotion versus vehicle (30.4% vs 17.9%; P<0.001). The most frequent treatment-emergent AEs related to tazarotene treatment were application site pain (5.3%), dryness (3.6%), and exfoliation (2.1%). Conclusions: The new tazarotene 0.045% lotion formulated with polymeric emulsion technology demonstrated statistically signifi-cantly superior efficacy versus vehicle and was well tolerated in pediatric and adult patients with moderate-to-severe acne in this pooled analysis of 2 vehicle-controlled phase 3 studies.

"BACKGROUND: Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a frequently encountered dermatological concern that impacts a patient's self-esteem and quality of life. Finasteride is a selective 5-alpha reductase inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment of male AGA and the off-label use in female pattern hair loss (FPHL); however, its adverse effects may limit its use. Topical finasteride is a new formulation that aims to decrease complications caused by oral administration. OBJECTIVE: This review assesses the pharmacology, current therapeutic use, and safety of topical finasteride for the treatment of AGA and FPHL. METHODS: A PubMed search was conducted to include all English language articles on topical finasteride from January 1992 to January 2020. RESULTS: A total of 33 articles including 28 topical finasteride related articles and five AGA related articles were included in this review. Multiple studies on topical finasteride as the treatment for male AGA and FPHL showed positive results with a favorable safety profile. CONCLUSIONS: Topical finasteride is a promising therapeutic option. We emphasize the importance of continued research for the establishment of a novel therapeutic agent. "
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Psoriasis is an autoimmune skin disease involving cascading release of cytokines activated by the innate and acquired immune system. The increasing prevalence rate of psoriasis demands for more appropriate therapy. The existing chemical moiety is promising for better therapeutic outcome, but the selection of a proper channel for administration has to be reviewed. Hence there is a need to select the most appropriate dosage form and route of administration for improving the curative rate of psoriasis. RESULTS: A total of 108 systematic reviews of research and review articles were conducted to make the manuscript comprehensible. The role of inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis of the disease is discussed for a better understanding of the selection of pharmacotherapy. The older and newer therapeutic moiety with its mode of administration for psoriasis treatment has been discussed. With a comparative review on topical and oral administration of first-line drugs such as methotrexate (MTX), cyclosporine (CsA), and betamethasone, its benefits-liabilities in the selected routes were accounted for. Emphasis has also been paid on advanced nanocarriers for dermatologic applications. CONCLUSION: For a better therapeutic outcome, proper selection of drug moiety with its appropriate administration is the major requisite. With the advent of nanotechnology, the development of nanocarrier for dermatologic application has been successfully demonstrated in positioning the systemically administrated drug into topical targeted delivery. In a nutshell, to achieve successful treatment strategies towards psoriasis, there is a need to focus on the development of stable, non-toxic nanocarrier for topical delivery. Inclusion of the existing orally administered drug moiety into nanocarriers for topical delivery is proposed in order to enhance therapeutics payload with reduced side effects which serves as a better treatment approach for relief of the psoriasis condition.

"Abstract: Nowadays, novel less-expensive nanoformulations for in situ-controlled and safe delivery of photosensitisers (PSs) against opportunistic pathogens in body-infections areas need to be developed. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a promising approach to treat bacterial infections that are recalcitrant to antibiotics. In this paper, we propose the design and characterization of a novel nanophototherapeutic based on the trade cyclodextrin CAPTISOL® (sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin, SBE-βCD) and 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphine tetrakis(p-toluenesulfonate) (TMPyP) to fabricate efficient biocompatible systems for aPDT. Spherical nanoassemblies of about 360 nm based on CAPTISOL®/TMPyP supramolecular complexes with 1:1 stoichiometry and apparent equilibrium binding constant (K "
"OBJECTIVE: Dithranol (DTH) is a well-known moiety that has long been used promisingly to impede and treat skin disorders, particularly psoriasis. Nowadays, a rekindled interest in the use of DTH for this disorder has been observed. Side effects associated with conventional topical formulations of this moiety have aroused the interest of the scientific community in investigating novel cargos of DTH for psoriasis management. RESULTS: Previous research has evidenced the anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferating potential of DTH. Numerous studies have indicated that DTH inhibits polymorphonuclear (PMN) leucocyte, modulates epidermal cell receptors and promotes anti-psoriatic action. However, some deterrent factors like poor solubility, stability, toxicity, staining and skin irritation hamper its use as a potential therapeutic agent. With the adoption of novel drug delivery technologies, the above mentioned inherent limitations of DTH have been compensated to reestablish this drug moiety. CONCLUSION: This article reviews novel drug delivery aspects, safety concerns, clinical evidence, current status, and future opportunities of DTH in the management of psoriasis. Further, it will update researchers on this promising drug moiety, which is free from systemic adverse responses in comparison to other therapeutic molecules like steroids, for psoriasis treatment.

"Abstract: Background Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory and systemic disease that primarily affects the skin, nails, and joints. Some medications have been linked to worsening clinical manifestations of cutaneous psoriasis. Objective To identify pharmacological treatments and drugs related to worsening dermatological lesions in patients with psoriasis. Setting Patients diagnosed with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis between November 1, 2018, and October 30, 2019. Methods This was a cross-sectional study from a population database that identified the prescriptions of patients with psoriasis during 2019. All medications prescribed for the treatment of psoriasis and other comorbidities were investigated. Main outcome measure Potentially inappropriate medications. Results We identified 2088 patients with psoriasis, with a mean age of 53.6 ± 15.5 years, and 52.9% were men. A total of 92.6% received pharmacological treatment, and of these, topical corticosteroids were the most commonly used group (76.6%). A total of 55.3% of patients with cutaneous psoriasis received at least one drug associated with worsening dermatological lesions. The most frequent were naproxen (25.5%), diclofenac (14.7%), and dexamethasone (10.8%). Residing in Barranquilla (odds ratio 1.27, 95%confidence interval 1.009-1.607), having any chronic comorbidities (odds ratio 1.94, 95%confidence interval 1.566-2.402), and having a history of coronary heart disease (odds ratio 6.25, 95%confidence interval 1.895-20.645) increased the probability of receiving these prescriptions. Conclusions The pharmacological treatment of psoriasis was in accordance with the recommendations of the clinical practice guidelines, but the high proportion of potentially inappropriate prescriptions makes it necessary to promote educational and pharmacovigilance strategies that improve the formulation habits of the physicians involved in the treatment of these patients.

"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common skin disease among pediatric patients, which affects up to 20% of children worldwide. Characterized by pruritus and eczema, it is also associated with improper skin barrier function and allergen sensitization. Here, we aimed to assess the presence of haptens in emollients marketed in two European countries: in Poland and Spain, as, firstly, these products are considered to be AD's basic therapy, and, secondly, frequent application of potent sensitizers on atopic skin may result in contact dermatitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically searched for moisturizers explicitly described as ""Atopic skin care"" products in the most frequently visited online pharmacies in Poland and Spain. Subsequently, we created a database of all products and compared their composition with 139 contact haptens listed in the European Baseline Series (EBS), Fragrance and Cosmetic Series. RESULTS: As of December 2018, our list comprised 159 and 111 emollients available on the Polish and Spanish markets, respectively. There were no ingredients listed in 28 (17.5%) products in Poland and 24 (21.6%) in Spain. Only 23 (17.5%) and 13 (14.8%) products were hapten free. The pattern of most common haptens was similar in both countries, including phenoxyethanol, tocopherol and tocopheryl acetate, undefined parfum in Poland and tocopherol, phenoxyethanol, tocopheryl acetate and undefined parfum in Spain. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that a vast majority of products taken into consideration contain at least one potential contact hapten. These findings indicate a need for patient education about potentially allergenic ingredients and stronger cooperation between academia and cosmetic manufacturers. "
"Abstract: The treatment of acne remains a challenge for dermatologists. A variety of conventional therapies are available for acne treatment such as topical and systemic medications. Although many of these traditional acne treatments are effective, the wide-spread nature of the disease and its sometimes resistant nature delineate the need for alternative therapies. Therefore, over the past decade, phototherapy has been introduced for the treatment of acne, such as pulsed dye lasers (PDLs) and photodynamic therapy (PDT). The aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of PDL and methylene blue-mediated photodynamic therapy (MB-PDT) in the treatment of mild to moderate acne. Split-face clinical trial including fifteen patients presenting with mild to moderate acne were treated with 585 nm PDL on the right side of the face and MB-PDT with 665-nm diode laser on the left side. The photosensitizer MB was prepared in nanoemulgel formulation, and the treatment was carried out for three sessions maximum at 2-weeks intervals. Results revealed that both PDL and MB-PDT were effective therapies in the treatment of acne, as manifested by the reduction of inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions throughout the treatment period. However, the latter therapy was proven more potent in the reduction of acne severity, and in terms of patients' tolerance. Therefore, it can be concluded that MB in the nanoemulgel form is a promising treatment approach for acne, and can be further experimented in the treatment of other dermatological diseases. "
"BACKGROUND: Retinol influences the process of keratinization of the epidermis, which improves stratum corneum structure and reduces transepidermal water loss. It also significantly enhances mature skin by brightening hyperpigmentation and reducing the signs of photoageing. Cosmeceuticals are intended to both provide aesthetic effects for the skin and allow dermatological treatment. The aim of the study was to assess the rejuvenating effect of retinol serum on facial skin at concentrations of 0.3 and 0.5%, as well as any improvements in skin brightening and elasticity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven volunteers were included in the study, after confirming tolerance. The novel formula was applied once daily to the face for a period of 12 weeks: one retinol concentration on the left side and the other on the right. The initial study with liquid crystal formula (study vehicle) was carried out for 8 weeks on 28 volunteers. Treatment efficiency was evaluated at baseline, and 56 and 84 days following treatment using the multi probe adapter and Fotomedicus imaging system. PRIMOS was used to measure skin surface roughness. The visual analogue scale method enabled the results to be determined by 3 independent specialists. RESULTS: Skin hyperpigmentation, unevenness, and wrinkles gradually decreased over the course of treatment, both on the left and right parts of the face. Adverse events were predominantly mild or moderate skin irritation. More frequent and more intense symptoms were observed on the left side (0.5%). CONCLUSION: Retinol in liquid crystal formulation is safe and provides significant clinical benefits associated with unification of skin colour, overall skin tone, skin elasticity, and moisture. Regular use of retinol typically results in brightening of the skin and reduced signs of ageing. The objective findings confirmed the effectiveness of the procedures. "
"AIM: Keratoconus is a common and progressive eye disease characterized by thinning and tapering of the cornea. This degenerative eye disease is currently treated in the clinic with an interventional technique (""epi-off"") that can cause serious side effects as a result of the surgical procedure. The aim of this project is to design innovative formulations for the development of a riboflavin-containing medicinal product to develop a non-invasive (""epi-on"") keratoconus treatment as an alternative to current treatment modalities. METHODS: Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) were successfully loaded with either riboflavin base of riboflavin-5-phosphate sodium and designed with either Stearylamine (positive charge) or Trancutol P (permeation enhancer). In vitro characterization studies, cytotoxicity and permeability studies were performed. Selected formulations and commercial preparations were applied and compared in ex-vivo corneal drug accumulation and transition studies. Furthermore, in vivo studies were performed to assess drug accumulation in the rat cornea and the corneal stability after NLC treatment was investigated via a biomechanical study on isolated rabbit corneas. RESULTS: Both in vitro and ex-vivo as well as in vivo data showed that from the prepared NLC formulations, the most effective formulation was riboflavin-5-phosphate sodium containing NLC with Transcutol P as permeation enhancer. It possessed the highest drug loading content, low accumulation in the cornea but high permeability through the cornea as well as the highest functional performance in corneal crosslinking. CONCLUSION: Topical application of riboflavin-5-phosphate sodium loaded NLC systems designed with permeation enhancer Transcutol P may act as a potential alternative for non-invasive keratoconus treatments. "
"BACKGROUND: Systemic methotrexate (MTX) is a useful treatment for many dermatologic conditions, however, the risk of adverse events prevents its use in patients with minimal or localized disease. Topical application of MTX may be an option to avoid the systemic adverse effects of oral MTX. OBJECTIVE: To assess what is known about the efficacy and safety of topical methotrexate. METHODS: A search on Pubmed was conducted. There were no limits on publication date. RESULTS: A total of 963 articles were discovered. Using our exclusion criteria, 916 articles were excluded; 47 articles were used for full text assessment. Topical MTX has been used primarily in psoriasis but also in mycosis fungoides, lymphomatoid papulosis, and oral precancerous lesions. Optimal delivery system and formulation for adequate penetration is still under investigation. CONCLUSION: The quality of evidence for the utility of topical methotrexate in psoriasis is good, however, for other dermatologic diseases, the quality is poor. Topical MTX with improved delivery methods may be a viable tool against certain localized dermatologic conditions for patients who do not tolerate oral MTX. Further double-blinded randomized controled studies are needed to substantiate the utility of topical methotrexate. "
"Abstract: Due to the epidemic nature, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), arthropod-borne alphaviruses, is considered as a potential public health threat worldwide. Currently, no antiviral drug or vaccine is available against alphaviruses. Nanotechnology with green synthesis of nanoparticles is a novel and emerging interdisciplinary field of science that involves the production and usage of nanomaterials. Nano-biomaterials are clean, safe, non-toxic, cost effective and environment friendly which have been largely exploited to develop novel antiviral drugs in recent years. In the current work, different nanometals (Ag, Fe and Zn) were impregnated into raw Citrus limetta peels. The characterization of synthesized biomaterials was done using XRD and XPS which confirmed the presence of metallic forms of Fe and Ag whereas ZnO was formed during the impregnation process. Based on TEM analysis, the average size of nanoparticles was found to be 5, 32 and 12 nm for Ag, Fe and ZnO respectively. For evaluation of antiviral activity, nano-biomaterials AgNps, FeNps and ZnONps were processed for cell culture based experiments. All the three nano-biomaterials significantly reduced CHIKV viral titer and viral RNA level as determined by plaque assay, real time PCR and immunofluorescence assay. The results revealed that silver and iron nano-biomaterials have higher antiviral potential in comparison to zinc against CHIKV. In conclusion, green synthesized nano-biomaterials can act as good antiviral agents. These nano-biomaterials can further be processed for formulation of effective and promising nanomedicines against CHIKV and other similar viruses which are a threat to human health. "
"BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure is related to skin and lip tumors. Therefore, the development of photoprotective lipstick formulations is of utmost importance. AIMS: Considering the biological properties of Shea butter (Butyrospermum parkii), we assessed its potential as an adjuvant in a molded lipstick sunscreen system by in vivo tests and photostability. PATIENTS/METHODS: Shea butter was used in a photoprotective lipstick formulation at two different concentrations (10.0% and 15.0% w/w) associated with ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHM) and titanium dioxide. Skin compatibility was assessed in vivo. The in vivo SPF value was determined according to the current recognized method. Additionally, the photostability of EHM was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: By the cutaneous compatibility, the product presented no interference with skin barrier and no adverse reactions, thus proving its safety. The in vivo SPF assay showed that the highest concentration of Shea butter increased the in vivo SPF value of the sample by 35%, demonstrating it to be a booster in photoprotective lipstick formulations. Also, Shea butter was proved to enhance the photostability of EHM, a commonly used UVB filter available in several countries. CONCLUSION: Shea butter increased the photostability and in vivo SPF of a molded lipstick sunscreen. "
"BACKGROUND: With the recent interest in personalized medicine for cancer patients and immune therapy, the field of cancer vaccines has been resurrected. Previous autologous, whole cell tumour vaccine trials have not produced convincing results due, in part to poor patient selection and inactivation methos that are harsh on the cells. These methods can alter protein structure and antigenic profiles making vaccine candidates ineffective in stimulating immune response to autochthonous tumour cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated a novel method for inactivating tumour cells that uses UVA/UVB light and riboflavin (vitamin B2) (RF + UV). RF + UV inactivates the tumour cells' ability to replicate, yet preserves tumour cell integrity and antigenicity. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that proteins are preserved on the surface of RF + UV-inactivated tumour cells and that they are immunogenic via induction of dendritic cell maturation, increase in IFNγ production and generation of tumour cell-specific IgG. Moreover, when formulated with an adjuvant ('Innocell vaccine') and tested in different murine tumour primary and metastatic disease models, decreased tumour growth, decreased metastatic disease and prolonged survival were observed. In addition, immune cells obtained from tumour tissue following vaccination had decreased exhausted and regulatory T cells, suggesting that activation of intra-tumoural T cells may be playing a role leading to reduced tumour growth. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the RF + UV inactivation of tumour cells may provide an efficacious method for generating autologous whole tumour cell vaccines for use in cancer patients. "
"Abstract: Sunscreen products contain UV filters as active ingredients for the protection of the skin against UVR. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a new proposed rule in 2019 (84.FR.6204) for sunscreens and identified the need for additional safety data for certain UV filters including their dermal absorption data. Dermal absorption data reveal systemic exposure of UV filters in humans, which can be obtained from clinical maximal usage trials. FDA guidance recommends conducting in vitro skin permeation tests (IVPTs) to help select formulations for maximal usage clinical trials as IVPT results may be indicative of in vivo absorption. This case study reports in vitro methodologies used for the selection of sunscreen products for an FDA-sponsored proof-of-concept maximal usage clinical trial. An IVPT method was developed using human cadaver skin. Commercially available sunscreen products were tested to determine the skin absorption potential of common UV filters using the IVPT. All the studied sunscreen products demonstrated a certain degree of skin absorption of UV filters using IVPT, and a formulation rank order was obtained. These sunscreen products were also characterized for several formulation properties including the globule size in emulsions, which was found to be an indicator for the rank order. "
"INTRODUCTION: Alopecia areata (AA) is a chronic inflammatory non-scarring type of hair loss. Current therapies for alopecia areata are rather limited and mainly involve the use of topical, intra-lesional or systemic steroids and topical immunotherapy, with variable benefit. Recent studies have demonstrated that vitamin D analogues could potentially promote hair growth in patients with patchy AA. METHODS: We investigated the efficacy and safety of treatment with calcipotriol, a synthetic derivative of vitamin D (calcipotriol 0.005% ointment), versus treatment with the corticosteroid clobetasol (topical clobetasol 0.05% formulation), in a series of 35 patients with scalp AA, using an intrasubject design. RESULTS: Patches treated with calcipotriol ointment showed greater and faster response rates than did those treated with topical clobetasol, although the differences were not statistically significant. The main strength of the study is its prospective design; the main limitation is the small number of participants. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the calcipotriol would appear to be reasonably effective in patients with mild to moderate patchy AA and was associated with only limited and reversible side effects. "
"Abstract: For several years, the international context is deeply affected by the use of chemical and biological weapons. The use of CBRN (Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear) threat agents from military stockpiles or biological civilian industry demonstrate the critical need to improve capabilities of decontamination for civilians and military. Physical decontamination systems that operate only by adsorption and displacement such as Fuller's Earth, have the drawback of not neutralizing hazardous agents, giving place to cross contaminations. Consequently, the development of a formulation based on metal oxide nanoparticles attracts considerable interest, since they offer physicochemical properties that allow them to both adsorb and degrade toxic compounds. Thus, the aim of this study is to found metal oxide nanoparticles with a versatile activity on both chemical and biological toxic agents. Therefore, several metal oxides such as MgO, TiO "
"Abstract: Ultraviolet radiation and visible light both have biologic effects on the skin. Visible light can induce erythema in light-skinned individuals and pigmentation in dark-skinned individuals. Broad-spectrum sunscreens protect against ultraviolet radiation but do not adequately protect against visible light. For a sunscreen to protect against visible light, it must be visible on the skin. Inorganic filters (also known as mineral filters), namely, zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, are used in the form of nanoparticles in sunscreens to minimize the chalky and white appearance on the skin; as such, they do not protect against visible light. Tinted sunscreens use different formulations and concentrations of iron oxides and pigmentary titanium dioxide to provide protection against visible light. Many shades of tinted sunscreens are available by combining different amounts of iron oxides and pigmentary titanium dioxide to cater to all skin phototypes. Therefore, tinted sunscreens are beneficial for patients with visible light-induced photodermatoses and those with hyperpigmentation disorders such as melasma and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.

"BACKGROUND: Rheumatic and musculoskeletal immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are observed in about 10% of patients with cancer receiving checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs). Given the recent emergence of these events and the lack of guidance for rheumatologists addressing them, a European League Against Rheumatism task force was convened to harmonise expert opinion regarding their identification and management. METHODS: First, the group formulated research questions for a systematic literature review. Then, based on literature and using a consensus procedure, 4 overarching principles and 10 points to consider were developed. RESULTS: The overarching principles defined the role of rheumatologists in the management of irAEs, highlighting the shared decision-making process between patients, oncologists and rheumatologists. The points to consider inform rheumatologists on the wide spectrum of musculoskeletal irAEs, not fulfilling usual classification criteria of rheumatic diseases, and their differential diagnoses. Early referral and facilitated access to rheumatologist are recommended, to document the target organ inflammation. Regarding therapeutic, three treatment escalations were defined: (1) local/systemic glucocorticoids if symptoms are not controlled by symptomatic treatment, then tapered to the lowest efficient dose, (2) conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, in case of inadequate response to glucocorticoids or for steroid sparing and (3) biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, for severe or refractory irAEs. A warning has been made on severe myositis, a life-threatening situation, requiring high dose of glucocorticoids and close monitoring. For patients with pre-existing rheumatic disease, baseline immunosuppressive regimen should be kept at the lowest efficient dose before starting immunotherapies. CONCLUSION: These statements provide guidance on diagnosis and management of rheumatic irAEs and aim to support future international collaborations. "
"Abstract: New insights about nanomaterials' biodistribution revealed their ability to achieve tumor accumulation by taking advantage from the dynamic vents occurring in tumor's vasculature. This paradigm-shift emphasizes the importance of extending nanomaterials' blood circulation time to enhance their tumor uptake. The classic strategy to improve nanomaterials' stability during circulation relies on their functionalization with poly(ethylene glycol). However, recent reports have been showing that PEGylated nanomaterials can suffer from the accelerated blood clearance phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of developing novel coatings for functionalizing the nanomaterials. To address this limitation, the modification of natural carriers' surface to enhance their stability appears to be a promising strategy. Herein, sulfobetaine methacrylate (SBMA)-functionalized bovine serum albumin (BSA) was synthesized for the first time to investigate the capacity of this modification to improve the resulting nanoparticles' physicochemical properties, colloidal stability and in vitro performance. This novel polymer was then employed in the formulation of nanoparticles loaded with IR780 for application in breast cancer phototherapy (IR/SBMA-BSA NPs). When compared to their non-functionalized equivalents, the IR/SBMA-BSA NPs presented a neutral surface charge and a higher stability in biologically relevant media. Due to these features, the IR/SBMA-BSA NPs could achieve a 1.9-fold greater uptake by breast cancer cells than IR/BSA NPs. Furthermore, the IR/SBMA-BSA NPs were cytocompatible towards normal cells and reduced breast cancer cells' viability up to 42%. The phototherapy mediated by IR/SBMA-BSA NPs could further decrease cancer cells' viability to about 12%. Overall, the IR/SBMA-BSA NPs have enhanced features that propel their application in breast cancer phototherapy. "
"INTRODUCTION: Psoriasis is identified as an inflammatory, chronic, auto-immune disease requiring long-term treatment, imposing an unnecessary burden on the patient. A significant impediment for the treatment of dermatological disorders via transdermal route is the inability of drug molecules to cross the stratum corneum (SC), as the larger size of drug molecules inhibits them to pervade into the skin, thus hampering their absorption. Some drugs exhibit systemic side-effects, which curbs patient compliance, resulting in treatment discontinuation. AREAS COVERED: This review aims to describe the detailed study such as demographic status, molecular factors of psoriasis, treatment with emerging combination therapy and role of nanotechnology tools in the treatment of psoriasis. EXPERT OPINION: To overcome problems related to the conventional drug delivery system, several nanotechnology-based formulations have been devised to enhance bioavailability, drug permeation and accumulation in the skin. Nano-formulations provide better permeation, targeted delivery and enhanced efficacy, thus gaining enormous popularity for cutaneous disorders. This pervasive review provides an overview of the pathophysiology of the disease, its molecular targets and the available herbal, synthetic and combination treatment modalities. The review also systematizes recent works utilizing nano-carriers to improve the treatment denouement of psoriasis. "
"Abstract: Excessive exposure to solar radiation induces injurious effects on human skin. Our previous study evidenced that protocatechuic acid (P0) and ethyl protocatechuate (P2) act against photodamage and photoaging. The present study aimed to develop solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) for topical delivery of P0 or P2, as a strategy for photoprotection. Lipid nanoparticles exhibited mean particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential and association efficiency between 200 and 400 nm, 0.160 to 0.460, -2.2 to -5.2 mV, and 60% to 80%, respectively. The formulations were stable for 3 months when stored at 4 "

"OBJECTIVE: During the development of cosmetic formulations, in vitro and in vivo methods are essential tools used to reliably assess the skin irritation potential of a product or ingredient. Epicutaneous patch testing (single and/or multiple application protocols) has long been used as an initial in vivo method to screen for possible skin irritation properties of a substance or formulation. To confirm the mildness and dermatological and/or consumer acceptance of a product, use tests are often subsequently conducted. A study was therefore initiated to see how well patch test results correlate with use tests with respect to irritation elicited by skincare (leave-on) products. METHODS/RESULTS: A number of different cosmetic formulations were assessed in both tests. Although the patch test results did not indicate substantial irritation potentials, immediate-type reactions (stinging and redness) were observed in some volunteers which disappeared within approx. 1 h. Although transient, these reactions suggested that consumer acceptance would probably be low and the studies were discontinued. Immediate-type reactions are rare but have been described for some substances used in cosmetics. These unexpected results were nevertheless intriguing and prompted the start of a journey to see if patch test protocols could be modified to assess these reactions. An occlusive short-term patch test protocol with an application period of 20 min was developed. Successful identification of the spontaneous reactions became possible. Furthermore, there was a correlation between the intensity of reactions observed in the short-term patch test and those observed in the controlled in-use studies. Short-term patch testing using the developed protocol can therefore reliably be used as a screening method, for example in the development and optimization of cosmetic formulations containing ingredients that could cause spontaneous reactions, for instance of non-immunological contact urticaria type. CONCLUSION: The lessons learned from this studies indicate that simple modifications of existing test protocols can lead to important insights into skin reactions. These modifications can then be used to create further building blocks in the development and optimization of test strategies for cosmetic formulations which offer reliable study designs for possible reactions product developers may encounter. OBJECTIF: Lors du développement de formulations cosmétiques, les méthodes in vitro et in vivo sont des outils essentiels utilisés pour évaluer de manière fiable le potentiel d'irritation cutanée d'un produit ou d'un ingrédient. Le test épicutané (protocoles d'application uniques et / ou multiples) est utilisé depuis longtemps comme méthode initiale in vivo pour dépister les éventuelles propriétés d'irritation cutanée d'une substance ou d'une formulation. Afin de confirmer la douceur et l'acceptation dermatologique et / ou consommateur d'un produit, des tests d'usage sont souvent effectués ultérieurement. Une étude a donc été initiée pour voir dans quelle mesure les résultats des tests épicutanés correspondent aux tests d'usage en ce qui concerne l'irritation provoquée par les produits de soin (sans rinçage). MÉTHODES/RÉSULTATS: Un certain nombre de formulations cosmétiques différentes ont été évaluées dans les deux tests. Bien que les résultats du test épicutané n'indiquent pas de potentiels d'irritation substantiels, des réactions de type immédiat (picotements et rougeurs) ont été observées chez certains volontaires. Celles-ci ont disparu en à peu près 1 heure. Bien que transitoires, ces réactions de type 5 suggéraient que l'acceptation du consommateur serait probablement faible et les études ont été interrompues. Les réactions de type immédiat 6 sont rares mais ont été évoquées en relation avec certaines substances utilisées en cosmétique. Ces résultats inattendus étaient néanmoins intrigants et ont incité le lancement d’un processus pour voir si les protocoles de test épicutané pouvaient être modifiés pour évaluer ces réactions. Un protocole de test épicutané à court terme occlusif avec une période d'application de 20 min a été développé, permettant l'identification réussie des réactions spontanées. Il a été de plus constate une corrélation entre l'intensité des réactions observées dans le test épicutané à court terme et celles observées dans les test d’usage contrôlés. Le test épicutané à court terme utilisant le protocole développé peut donc être utilisé de manière fiable comme méthode de dépistage, par exemple dans le développement et l'optimisation de formulations cosmétiques contenant des ingrédients qui pourraient provoquer des réactions spontanées, par exemple de type urticaire de contact non immunologique. CONCLUSION: Les leçons tirées de ces études indiquent que de simples modifications des protocoles de test existants peuvent révéler des informations importantes sur les réactions cutanées. Ces modifications peuvent ensuite être utilisées pour créer d'autres blocs de construction dans le développement et l'optimisation de stratégies de test pour des formulations cosmétiques qui offrent des conceptions d'études fiables pour les réactions possibles que les développeurs de produits peuvent rencontrer.

"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Acne vulgaris, a chronic inflammatory disease, affects more than 90% of teenagers. The first-line treatments for acne vulgaris are topical and oral medications, mainly antibiotics and retinoids. However, antibiotic resistance of Propionibacterium acnes, contraindications, partial response, significant adverse effects, or recurrence creates demand for novel treatment options in acne. Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a well-established modality in the treatment of acne. Nevertheless, PDT has limitations: it may not be effective for every patient; several treatments are usually required to achieve sufficient outcome; incubation time is 1-3 hours; treatment pain and post-treatment downtime may be difficult for some patients to endure; and adverse effects may occur. This retrospective chart review was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PDT, assisted by a thermomechanical ablation (TMA) fractional injury device in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe acne. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 30 acne patients treated with TMA immediately before 5% ALA application with an incubation time of 1 hour and exposure to 60 J/cm RESULTS: Compared with baseline, the AGSS has showed a statistically significant reduction of 26.7% and 23.7%, respectively, at weeks 8 and 16 after final treatment. The Leeds score showed 65.2% and 60.6% improvement at the respective visits. The overall response rate was graded 3.3 ± 0.5 out of 4. PGIC score given by the patients was 5.5 out of 7, reflecting high satisfaction. CONCLUSION: TMA used immediately prior to ALA application may enhance the effectiveness of PDT in the treatment of acne with minimal side effects, reduced downtime, and fewer sessions. The exact mechanism of TMA-assisted PDT is still to be understood. Lasers Surg. Med. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. "
"BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has severe adverse effects. Ortho-vanillin, an inhibitor of Toll-like receptors (TLR), can prevent inflammation. Glucan is a cereal fiber recognized by dectin-1 or β-glucan receptors of phagocytic macrophages. The purpose of the current project was to study the effect of co-administration of MTX and vanillin by targeted delivery to macrophages using β-glucan microspheres to reduce inflammation of RA. METHODS: MTX and vanillin nanoparticles in bovine serum albumin (BSA) or gelatin were doped in glucan particles (GPs) and characterized for their physical properties. Twenty-four hours after induction of RA in paw of rats, they received normal saline (1 mg/kg, ip), MTX (2 mg/kg/week, ip), β-glucan (1 mg/kg/week, ip), GPs-MTX (2 mg/kg/week, ip), GPs-vanillin (200 mg/kg/day, po), and GPs-MTX (2 mg/kg/week, ip) plus GPs-vanillin (200 mg/kg/day, po). The last group received free MTX ip and vanillin po for 14 days. Then, joint diameters, TNF-α and IL-6, were evaluated in rats. RESULTS: The particle size of the GPs was 5.3 µm. MTX loading efficiency in glucan microspheres was 64.5% and vanillin 44.2%. The microspheres released 88.7% of MTX and 95.1% of vanillin over 24 h. The results of in vivo studies showed a significant reduction in paw volume, TNF-α and IL-6 (p < 0.05) in animals treated with combination of MTX and vanillin-doped glucan microspheres compared to the mixture of the two drugs in free form or each drug alone. CONCLUSIONS: Co-administration of MTX and vanillin-doped GPs may be more effective than MTX alone in RA. "
"Abstract: Annually, thousands of individuals die and tens of thousands are hospitalized in association with suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in Canada. We analyzed the reports from the Canada Vigilance Adverse Reaction online database and present a synopsis of the state of ADRs in Canada between 2009 and 2018. Our synopsis includes both cross-sectional and longitudinal insights into ADR demographics, outcomes, associated drugs and disease indications. In closing, we highlight five overarching issues uncovered in our analysis, which have potential implications for future policy formulation. Further in-depth exploration is required to shine some additional light on these issues. "

"Abstract: Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure is well established as the major environmental risk factor for the development of melanoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Additional risk factors including genetic mutations, other environmental agents, and immune status are important in modulating the effects of UVR. Dermatologists advocate a multi-pronged approach to minimizing UVR exposure including lifestyle modifications, UVR protective clothing, and topically applied sun-protective products,  "
"Abstract: The dysregulation of the JAK-STAT pathway is associated with various immune disorders. Four JAK inhibitors have been approved for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and numerous JAK inhibitors are currently being tested in phase II and III trials for the treatment of various autoimmune inflammatory diseases. In this narrative review, we elucidate the involvement of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of connective tissue diseases (CTDs). We also discuss the efficacy of the first- and second-generation JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, baricitinib, ruxolitinib, peficitinib, filgotinib, upadacitinib, solcitinib, itacitinib, decernotinib, R333, and pf-06651600) for CTDs including RA, systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis, Sjögren's syndrome, and vasculitis, based on laboratory and clinical research findings. JAK inhibitors have great potential for the treatment of various CTDs by reducing multiple cytokine production and suppressing inflammation, with the advantages of rapid onset in an oral formulation and decreased corticosteroid dependence and the associated adverse events, especially in refractory cases. We also highlight the safety of novel JAK inhibitors, which can cause opportunistic infections, especially viral infections. Being a very recent therapeutic option, information regarding the safety of JAK inhibitors during pregnancy and for pediatric use is limited. However, it is recommended that JAK inhibitors should be avoided in pregnant and breastfeeding women. More clinical data, especially on highly selective inhibitors, are required to judge the efficacy and safety of JAK inhibition in CTDs. "
"Abstract: Methotrexate (MTX) is the first line agent for therapy against rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, orally its efficacy is hampered by poor solubility, less permeability, short plasma half-life, and reduced bioavailability. Meanwhile, parenteral formulations are associated with severe adverse effects. In an attempt to improve the efficacy of MTX, we synthesized polycaprolactone-polyethylene glycol-polycaprolactone (PCL-PEG-PCL) triblock copolymer by a ring-opening copolymerization reaction and used it as a carrier for the fabrication of MTX-loaded nanomicelles. Surfactant-free, self-assembled nanomicelles were prepared by nanoprecipitation technique and optimized through central composite design. The optimized nanomicelles exhibited a size distribution of 31 nm and an encapsulation efficiency of 91%.  "
"BACKGROUND: Acne is a common, economically burdensome condition that can cause psychological harm and, potentially, scarring. Topical benzoyl peroxide (BPO) is a widely used acne treatment; however, its efficacy and safety have not been clearly evaluated. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of BPO for acne. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases up to February 2019: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs that compared topical BPO used alone (including different formulations and concentrations of BPO) or as part of combination treatment against placebo, no treatment, or other active topical medications for clinically diagnosed acne (used alone or in combination with other topical drugs not containing BPO) on the face or trunk. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. Primary outcome measures were 'participant global self-assessment of acne improvement' and 'withdrawal due to adverse events in the whole course of a trial'. 'Percentage of participants experiencing any adverse event in the whole course of a trial' was a key secondary outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We included 120 trials (29,592 participants randomised in 116 trials; in four trials the number of randomised participants was unclear). Ninety-one studies included males and females. When reported, 72 trials included participants with mild to moderate acne, 26 included participants with severe acne, and the mean age of participants ranged from 18 to 30 years. Our included trials assessed BPO as monotherapy, as add-on treatment, or combined with other active treatments, as well as BPO of different concentrations and BPO delivered through different vehicles. Comparators included different concentrations or formulations of BPO, placebo, no treatment, or other active treatments given alone or combined. Treatment duration in 80 trials was longer than eight weeks and was only up to 12 weeks in 108 trials. Industry funded 50 trials; 63 trials did not report funding. We commonly found high or unclear risk of performance, detection, or attrition bias. Trial setting was under-reported but included hospitals, medical centres/departments, clinics, general practices, and student health centres. We reported on outcomes assessed at the end of treatment, and we classified treatment periods as short-term (two to four weeks), medium-term (five to eight weeks), or long-term (longer than eight weeks). For 'participant-reported acne improvement', BPO may be more effective than placebo or no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12 to 1.45; 3 RCTs; 2234 participants; treatment for 10 to 12 weeks; low-certainty evidence). Based on low-certainty evidence, there may be little to no difference between BPO and adapalene (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.10; 5 RCTs; 1472 participants; treatment for 11 to 12 weeks) or between BPO and clindamycin (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.34; 1 RCT; 240 participants; treatment for 10 weeks) (outcome not reported for BPO versus erythromycin or salicylic acid). For 'withdrawal due to adverse effects', risk of treatment discontinuation may be higher with BPO compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.55 to 2.93; 24 RCTs; 13,744 participants; treatment for 10 to 12 weeks; low-certainty evidence); the most common causes of withdrawal were erythema, pruritus, and skin burning. Only very low-certainty evidence was available for the following comparisons: BPO versus adapalene (RR 1.85, 95% CI 0.94 to 3.64; 11 RCTs; 3295 participants; treatment for 11 to 24 weeks; causes of withdrawal not clear), BPO versus clindamycin (RR 1.93, 95% CI 0.90 to 4.11; 8 RCTs; 3330 participants; treatment for 10 to 12 weeks; causes of withdrawal included local hypersensitivity, pruritus, erythema, face oedema, rash, and skin burning), erythromycin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.26; 1 RCT; 60 participants; treatment for 8 weeks; withdrawal due to dermatitis), and salicylic acid (no participants had adverse event-related withdrawal; 1 RCT; 59 participants; treatment for 12 weeks). There may be little to no difference between these groups in terms of withdrawal; however, we are unsure of the results because the evidence is of very low certainty. For 'proportion of participants experiencing any adverse event', very low-certainty evidence leaves us uncertain about whether BPO increased adverse events when compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.70; 21 RCTs; 11,028 participants; treatment for 10 to 12 weeks), with adapalene (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.00; 7 RCTs; 2120 participants; treatment for 11 to 24 weeks), with erythromycin (no participants reported any adverse events; 1 RCT; 89 participants; treatment for 10 weeks), or with salicylic acid (RR 4.77, 95% CI 0.24 to 93.67; 1 RCT; 41 participants; treatment for 6 weeks). Moderate-certainty evidence shows that the risk of adverse events may be increased for BPO versus clindamycin (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.58; 6 RCTs; 3018 participants; treatment for 10 to 12 weeks); however, the 95% CI indicates that BPO might make little to no difference. Most reported adverse events were mild to moderate, and local dryness, irritation, dermatitis, erythema, application site pain, and pruritus were the most common. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests that BPO as monotherapy or add-on treatment may be more effective than placebo or no treatment for improving acne, and there may be little to no difference between BPO and either adapalene or clindamycin. Our key efficacy evidence is based on participant self-assessment; trials of BPO versus erythromycin or salicylic acid did not report this outcome. For adverse effects, the evidence is very uncertain regarding BPO compared with adapalene, erythromycin, or salicylic acid. However, risk of treatment discontinuation may be higher with BPO compared with placebo or no treatment. Withdrawal may be linked to tolerability rather than to safety. Risk of mild to moderate adverse events may be higher with BPO compared with clindamycin. Further trials should assess the comparative effects of different preparations or concentrations of BPO and combination BPO versus monotherapy. These trials should fully assess and report adverse effects and patient-reported outcomes measured on a standardised scale. "

"BACKGROUND: APT-1011, a fluticasone propionate orally disintegrating tablet formulation, is under investigation for the treatment of eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE). AIMS: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of APT-1011 administered to patients with EoE and to assess the effect on clinical symptoms of EoE, endoscopic appearance and oesophageal eosinophilia. METHODS: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase 1b/2a study was conducted at seven medical centres in the US to evaluate the safety and tolerability of APT-1011 over 8 weeks in adults and adolescents with EoE. Participants were randomised to placebo (n = 8), 1.5 mg APT-1011 BID (n = 8) or 3.0 mg APT-1011 QD (n = 8). Safety and tolerability were assessed as the primary outcome; histologic and endoscopic measures were assessed as exploratory outcomes. RESULTS: There were no deaths, serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), severe TEAEs or discontinuations from the study related to a TEAE. In one participant randomised to 1.5 mg APT-1011 BID, a reduction in cortisol was observed, but without evidence of adrenal insufficiency. Compared with placebo, treatment with APT-1011 resulted in greater reductions in oesophageal eosinophil counts, EoE Endoscopic Reference Score, patient global assessment and symptom-based EoE activity index from baseline to end of treatment (Week 8). CONCLUSIONS: APT-1011 was safe and well tolerated in adolescents and adults with EoE. Exploratory efficacy outcomes demonstrated improvement in histologic and endoscopic findings as well evidence of symptom improvement. The results of this study support the continued development of APT-1011 for the treatment of EoE (NCT-01386112). "

"BACKGROUND: Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a relatively common chronic T cell-mediated disease, which can cause significant pain, particularly in its erosive or ulcerative forms. As pain is the indication for treatment of OLP, pain resolution is the primary outcome for this review. This review is an update of a version last published in 2011, but focuses on the evidence for corticosteroid treatment only. A second review considering non-corticosteroid treatments is in progress. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects and safety of corticosteroids, in any formulation, for treating people with symptoms of oral lichen planus. SEARCH METHODS: Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases to 25 February 2019: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, CENTRAL (2019, Issue 1), MEDLINE Ovid, and Embase Ovid. ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. There were no restrictions on language or date of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of any local or systemic corticosteroid treatment compared with a placebo, a calcineurin inhibitor, another corticosteroid, any other local or systemic (or both) drug, or the same corticosteroid plus an adjunctive treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently scanned the titles and abstracts of all reports identified, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool and extracted data from included studies. For dichotomous outcomes, we expressed the estimates of effects of an intervention as risk ratios (RR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes, we used mean differences (MD) and 95% CI. The statistical unit of analysis was the participant. We conducted meta-analyses only with studies of similar comparisons reporting the same outcome measures. We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included 35 studies (1474 participants) in this review. We assessed seven studies at low risk of bias overall, 11 at unclear and the remaining 17 studies at high risk of bias. We present results for our main outcomes, pain and clinical resolution measured at the end of the treatment course (between one week and six months), and adverse effects. The limited evidence available for comparisons between different corticosteroids, and corticosteroids versus alternative or adjunctive treatments is presented in the full review. Corticosteroids versus placebo Three studies evaluated the effectiveness and safety of topical corticosteroids in an adhesive base compared to placebo. We were able to combine two studies in meta-analyses, one evaluating clobetasol propionate and the other flucinonide. We found low-certainty evidence that pain may be more likely to be resolved when using a topical corticosteroid rather than a placebo (RR 1.91, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.36; 2 studies, 72 participants; I² = 0%). The results for clinical effect of treatment and adverse effects were inconclusive (clinical resolution: RR 6.00, 95% CI 0.76 to 47.58; 2 studies, 72 participants; I² = 0%; very low-certainty evidence; adverse effects RR 1.48, 95% 0.48 to 4.56; 3 studies, 88 participants, I² = 0%, very low-certainty evidence). Corticosteroids versus calcineurin inhibitors Three studies compared topical clobetasol propionate versus topical tacrolimus. We found very low-certainty evidence regarding any difference between tacrolimus and clobetasol for the outcomes pain resolution (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.88; 2 studies, 100 participants; I² = 80%), clinical resolution (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.99; 2 studies, 52 participants; I² = 95%) and adverse effects (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.83; 2 studies, 100 participants; very low-certainty evidence) . One study (39 participants) compared topical clobetasol and ciclosporin, and provided only very low-certainty evidence regarding the rate of clinical resolution with clobetasol (RR 3.16, 95% CI 1.00 to 9.93), pain resolution (RR 2.11, 95% CI 0.76 to 5.86) and adverse effects (RR 6.32, 95% CI 0.84 to 47.69). Two studies (60 participants) that compared triamcinolone and tacrolimus found uncertain evidence regarding the rate of clinical resolution (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.35; very low-certainty evidence) and that there may be a lower rate of adverse effects in the triamcinolone group (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.99; low-certainty evidence). These studies did not report on pain resolution. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroids have been first line for the treatment of OLP. This review found that these drugs, delivered topically as adhesive gels or similar preparations, may be more effective than placebo for reducing the pain of symptomatic OLP; however, with the small number of studies and participants, our confidence in the reliability of this finding is low. The results for clinical response were inconclusive, and we are uncertain about adverse effects. Very low-certainty evidence suggests that calcineurin inhibitors, specifically tacrolimus, may be more effective at resolving pain than corticosteroids, although there is some uncertainty about adverse effects and clinical response to tacrolimus showed conflicting results.

"Abstract: BACKGROUND: There has been an increasing interest in gender differences both in the pathogenesis and treatment of acne vulgaris (acne). However, while acne prevalence among adolescents is comparable across sexes, acne is much more common in adult women than in adult men which has been largely ignored. Acne is likely less common in adult men because of the declining rate of sebum secretion observed with increasing age, and yet it can be more severe than in adult women. In addition, adherence to topical medications is especially poor in adult men where tactile and sensory perceptions are low. The first lotion formulation of tazarotene was developed using polymeric emulsion technology to provide an important alternative option to treat these acne patients, especially those who may be sensitive to the irritant effects of other tazarotene formulations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new tazarotene 0.045% lotion formulation based on polymeric emulsion technology in treating adult male subjects with moderate or severe acne, in comparison with adolescent males treated with the same tazarotene 0.045% lotion. METHODS: Post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 3 studies in moderate-or-severe acne. Subjects (aged 10 and older, N=1614) were randomized (1:1) to receive tazarotene 0.045% lotion or vehicle, once-daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy assessments included changes in baseline inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions and treatment success (at least 2-grade reduction in Evaluator’s Global Severity Score [EGSS] and clear or almost clear). Quality of Life was assessed using the validated Acne-QoL scale. Safety, adverse events (AEs) were evaluated throughout; cutaneous tolerability (using a 4-point scale where 0=none and 3=severe) at each study visit. RESULTS: A total of 268 male subjects (85≥18 years old and 183<18 years old) were treated with tazarotene 0.045% lotion once-daily for 12 weeks. At week 12, percent reductions in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions with tazarotene 0.045% lotion were 62.3% and 59.5% in the adult male population, compared with 49.4% (P=0.001) and 49.5% (P=0.016) in the adolescent male population. Treatment success was achieved by 33.0% of adult male subjects treated with tazarotene 0.045% lotion, compared with 21.6% in the adolescent male population (P=0.059). Quality of life (as assessed by Acne-QoL domain scores) was better in adolescent males at baseline. Improvements in QoL domain scores were similar to those seen in the overall study population, with greater absolute change in domain scores in the adult males. Improvement in acne symptom scores was significantly greater in adult males (P=0.029). Tazarotene 0.045% lotion was well-tolerated. The number of subjects reporting any AE in the adult male population was 11 (13.6%) compared with 39 (21.4%) in the adolescent male population. There was only one (1.2%) treatment-related AE (application site pain) reported in the adult males compared with 11 (6.0%) in the adolescent males, where the most common treatment-related AEs were application site pain (3.3%), dryness (1.1%), and erythema (1.1%). Mean scores for hyper- and hypopigmentation were very low at baseline in both groups with no appreciable change with treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Tazarotene 0.045% lotion provides greater efficacy and better tolerability in adult males (above 18 years old) than the adolescent male population with moderate-to-severe acne patients.

"BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that ingeminates itself with the repeated proliferation of keratinocytes. It globally strikes a 2-5 % population on an average. Management of psoriasis remains a daunting task with various challenges influencing treatment, such as patient conformity and adherence to therapy, delicate patient profiles, psychological aspects, and skin as a barrier to topical delivery. The first part reviewed pathophysiology, triggering factors, and clinical classification. The second part reviewed all the therapies, such as topical, oral, biological, parenteral therapy, phototherapy, and the phyto-pharmaceuticals. METHODS: The research data related to the existing and upcoming therapies for psoriasis treatment, several nanocarriers, existing marketed formulations, and detailed description of phytopharmaceuticals with their mechanism. RESULTS: Topical therapy is the mainstay treatment option with limited adverse effects. Biological therapy has reformed conventional psoriasis treatment by being more efficacious and has increased patient acceptance due to decreased adverse events. Nanoformulations present an edge over conventional therapy due to improved anti-psoriatic effect and decreased side effects. Phyto-pharmaceuticals act as a complementary and alternative therapy for diminishing psoriasis symptoms. CONCLUSION: A rationalized cost-effective patient compliant therapy is required for effective management and complete cure of psoriasis. "
"Abstract: Benzoyl peroxide (BPO) in the form of over the counter monotherapeutics or prescription-only combinations is a key component of topical acne therapy, but its unfavourable side effect profile reduces the therapeutic value of this compound. Various galenic approaches have been pursued to resolve this ambivalence, but only a few have managed to enter the market. This article aims to give a comprehensive overview of the published experimental vehicle systems and to identify the fundamental rationales. With regard to the formulation, an increase in the tolerability of BPO can essentially be achieved by combining BPO with re-fattening and moisturizing substances, by incorporating it and controlling its release, as well as by targeted deposition of the active ingredient at the site of action, i.e. drug targeting. Recently, novel particulate formulations have been proposed that combine several of these design principles and are expected to bring new developments in this dynamic field of research. "
"IMPORTANCE: A prior pilot study demonstrated the systemic absorption of 4 sunscreen active ingredients; additional studies are needed to determine the systemic absorption of additional active ingredients and how quickly systemic exposure exceeds 0.5 ng/mL as recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). OBJECTIVE: To assess the systemic absorption and pharmacokinetics of the 6 active ingredients (avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene, homosalate, octisalate, and octinoxate) in 4 sunscreen products under single- and maximal-use conditions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical trial at a clinical pharmacology unit (West Bend, Wisconsin) was conducted in 48 healthy participants. The study was conducted between January and February 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to 1 of 4 sunscreen products, formulated as lotion (n = 12), aerosol spray (n = 12), nonaerosol spray (n = 12), and pump spray (n = 12). Sunscreen product was applied at 2 mg/cm2 to 75% of body surface area at 0 hours on day 1 and 4 times on day 2 through day 4 at 2-hour intervals, and 34 blood samples were collected over 21 days from each participant. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the maximum plasma concentration of avobenzone over days 1 through 21. Secondary outcomes were the maximum plasma concentrations of oxybenzone, octocrylene, homosalate, octisalate, and octinoxate over days 1 through 21. RESULTS: Among 48 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 38.7 [13.2] years; 24 women [50%]; 23 white [48%], 23 African American [48%], 1 Asian [2%], and 1 of unknown race/ethnicity [2%]), 44 (92%) completed the trial. Geometric mean maximum plasma concentrations of all 6 active ingredients were greater than 0.5 ng/mL, and this threshold was surpassed on day 1 after a single application for all active ingredients. For avobenzone, the overall maximum plasma concentrations were 7.1 ng/mL (coefficient of variation [CV], 73.9%) for lotion, 3.5 ng/mL (CV, 70.9%) for aerosol spray, 3.5 ng/mL (CV, 73.0%) for nonaerosol spray, and 3.3 ng/mL (CV, 47.8%) for pump spray. For oxybenzone, the concentrations were 258.1 ng/mL (CV, 53.0%) for lotion and 180.1 ng/mL (CV, 57.3%) for aerosol spray. For octocrylene, the concentrations were 7.8 ng/mL (CV, 87.1%) for lotion, 6.6 ng/mL (CV, 78.1%) for aerosol spray, and 6.6 ng/mL (CV, 103.9%) for nonaerosol spray. For homosalate, concentrations were 23.1 ng/mL (CV, 68.0%) for aerosol spray, 17.9 ng/mL (CV, 61.7%) for nonaerosol spray, and 13.9 ng/mL (CV, 70.2%) for pump spray. For octisalate, concentrations were 5.1 ng/mL (CV, 81.6%) for aerosol spray, 5.8 ng/mL (CV, 77.4%) for nonaerosol spray, and 4.6 ng/mL (CV, 97.6%) for pump spray. For octinoxate, concentrations were 7.9 ng/mL (CV, 86.5%) for nonaerosol spray and 5.2 ng/mL (CV, 68.2%) for pump spray. The most common adverse event was rash, which developed in 14 participants. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study conducted in a clinical pharmacology unit and examining sunscreen application among healthy participants, all 6 of the tested active ingredients administered in 4 different sunscreen formulations were systemically absorbed and had plasma concentrations that surpassed the FDA threshold for potentially waiving some of the additional safety studies for sunscreens. These findings do not indicate that individuals should refrain from the use of sunscreen. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03582215. "

"Abstract: A sunscreen should form a stable and homogeneous film over the skin surface, which can improve its photoprotective activity and avoid adverse effects. For this purpose, the definition of the appropriate vehicle is of fundamental importance since emulsifying agents are known to directly influence the stability, sensorial properties and surface tension of sunscreens, modulating their film-forming performance. In this context, the objective of the present study was to systematically develop formulations with UVB/UVA protection and evaluate the effect of wax concentration on the rheological behaviour. A 2-level full factorial design was applied for the development of four formulations. Two categorical factors were evaluated, glyceryl stearate plus PEG-75 stearate (Wax 1) and methyl glucose sesquistearate (Wax 2). Rheological behaviour was determined in triplicate and rheograms were analysed using the Ostwald model. Rheological parameters were correlated by the Spearman rank correlation test and effects were evaluated by Pareto chart and surface response methodology (SRM). It was possible to identify the pseudoplastic and thixotropic behaviour of all formulations exhibiting a thinning effect on higher shear stress. Factorial analysis showed that both waxes significantly influenced consistency and thixotropic behaviour. The effect of Wax 2 concentration in thixotropy was positive and of higher magnitude and a synergistic effect was also observed. Spearman correlation coefficient of consistency index and apparent viscosity was significantly strong and positive. Finally, factorial analysis allowed the determination of the effects of waxes on the rheological parameters of the formulations. A quantitative relationship between wax concentration and significant responses was established, permitting the prediction of desirable rheological properties for improved sunscreen efficacy. "
"Abstract: The use of sunscreens is an important and essential component of photoprotection. Since their introduction during the first half of the last century, sunscreens have benefited enormously from major technological advances such as the development of novel UV filters; as a result, their efficacy in preventing UV-induced erythema is unequivocal. More recently, however, new challenges have appeared, which have prompted a robust discussion about the safety of sunscreens. These include topics directly related to photoprotection of human skin such as improved/alternative methods for standardization of assessment of the efficacy of sunscreens, but also many others such as photoprotection beyond UV, concerns about human toxicity and ecological safety, the potential of oral photoprotective measures, consequences of innovative galenic formulations. On a first glance, some of these might raise questions and doubts among dermatologists, physicians and the general public about the use sunscreens as a means of photoprotection. This situation has prompted us to critically review such challenges, but also opportunities, based on existing scientific evidence. We conclude by providing our vision about how such challenges can be met best in the future in an attempt to create the ideal sunscreen, which should provide adequate and balanced protection and be easy and safe to use.

"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common chronic autoimmune disease that seriously affects the quality of life of patients because of damage to joints. Presently, RA is mainly treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or biological agents; however, they offer limited efficacy in some patients. Therefore, additional therapeutic strategies need to be developed. Yishen Tongbi decoction is a traditional Chinese medicine formulation widely used to treat RA in China. However, currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend its use for the treatment of RA. Therefore, we aim to verify the efficacy of Yishen Tongbi decoction to treat RA by a noninferiority trial, and to provide a basis for its use with a full-scale clinical trial. METHODS/DESIGN: One hundred eligible patients with RA will be randomized into two groups of 50 patients. One group will receive Yishen Tongbi decoction and placebo replacing methotrexate (MTX), while the other group will receive MTX and placebo replacing Yishen Tongbi decoction. Patient's whose visual analogue scale score for pain is greater than 40 mm will be administered nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as enteric-coated diclofenac sodium, 25 mg three times a day); administration of all medications will be recorded. The clinical indicators of patients and their disease activity will be assessed at baseline and at 4, 12 and 24 weeks after treatment initiation. The primary outcome of efficacy will be the proportion of patients who demonstrate a favourable response based on their Clinical Disease Activity Index score at 24 weeks after treatment. All adverse events will be reported. DISCUSSION: Traditional Chinese medicine theory and modern western medicine research have identified the efficacy of Yishen Tongbi decoction to treat RA. Previous clinical observation and efficacy trials of Yishen Tongbi decoction in animal models for the treatment of RA has demonstrated significant effect. Because of the potential benefits of Yishen Tongbi decoction in the treatment of patients with RA, we designed this double-blind, prospective, randomized controlled trial; the results and conclusions of the trail will be published after the completion of the study.

"Abstract: The objectives of the present investigations are (1) to envisage a risk assessment plan for nonphospholipid-based topical ophthalmic emulsions with the help of failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA), (2) to screen the risky formulation and process variables by the Taguchi design, (3) to optimize systematically an emulsion formula by face-centered central composite design (CCD), (4) to incorporate cyclosporin A (0.05 or 0.1% w/w) into the optimized emulsions and predict the in vitro drug release kinetic via a particle diffusion-controlled mathematical model equation, and (5) to assess the emulsion's toxicity using in vitro hemolysis study. Through the risk priority number (RPN) scores of FMEA, half-normal and Pareto charts of the Taguchi design, 3D-response surface graphs, and overlay plots of CCD, the emulsion formula was systematically optimized. Irrespective of the two different drug loadings into optimized emulsions, the drug entrapment efficiency values ranged from 73.20 ± 0.13 to 74.42 ± 0.15%. The film diffusion or ion-exchange process fails to interpret the in vitro drug release kinetic profile. A permissible percentage hemolysis value of above 10% but below 25% guidance was observed for emulsions with or without cyclosporin A. The systematically optimized phospholipidless ophthalmic emulsions could further be exploited commercially for managing dry-eye syndrome. "
"Abstract: BACKGROUND: While it is generally considered to be a disease of adolescence, acne affects an increasing number of adults, especially women. Although data exist on the use of retinoids in adult females, there is no universal agreement as to the age of onset of adult female acne, or data on the efficacy and tolerability dependent on age. A novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion formulation has been shown to be effective and well-tolerated in acne patients with moderate or severe disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of once-daily tretinoin 0.05% lotion in women with moderate or severe acne categorized into different age groups (13-19, 20-29, and 30+ years). METHODS: Post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 3 studies. Women (aged 13-19 years, N=357; 20-29 years, N=352; 30+ years, N=156) with moderate or severe acne were randomized (1:1) to receive tretinoin 0.05% lotion or vehicle, once-daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy assessments included changes in baseline inflammatory/noninflammatory lesions and treatment success (at least 2-grade reduction in Evaluator’s Global Severity Score [EGSS] and ‘clear’/’almost clear’) and Quality of Life (QoL) using the validated Acne-QoL questionnaire. Safety and adverse events (AEs) where evaluated throughout; cutaneous tolerability assessed at each study visit using a 4-point scale (where 0=none and 3=severe). RESULTS: At baseline, 91.9% (N=794) of women in the post hoc analysis had moderate (EGSS=3) and 8.1% (N=70) severe (EGSS=4) acne, with the highest proportion of women (11.1%, N=39) having severe acne being aged 20-29 years. Baseline inflammatory lesion counts were similar across the three age ranges, with more comedonal lesions (44.5) in adolescent females (aged 13-19 years). Quality of life at baseline was much better in adolescent females and may be age-related for some domains (self-perception and role-social). At week 12, there appeared to be an age-related improvement in both inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts, and treatment success although the differences between groups were not significant. Mean percent reduction in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts for each age group (13-19, 20-29, and 30+ years old respectively) were 55.3% (P=0.019 versus vehicle), 55.8% (P=0.080) and 63.5%; and 47.1% (P<0.001), 55.2% (P=0.002) and 59.0% (P=0.030). Treatment success for the 3 groups was achieved by 23.2% (P=0.023), 21.3%, and 30.7% of patients, respectively, at week 12; differences between age groups were not significant. Quality of Life improved in all age groups, although changes with tretinoin 0.05% lotion were only significant compared with vehicle in adult females aged 20-29 years (self-perception, role-emotional and acne symptoms); improvements in each domain score by week 12 were also greatest in this age group. The majority of AEs were mild and transient; the most common treatment emergent AEs were application site pain and dryness especially in the older adult females (aged 30+ years). Local cutaneous safety and tolerability assessments were generally mild and improved by week 12. There were transient increases in scaling, burning and stinging in the adolescent females, peaking at week 4; all mean scores were ≤0.6 where 1=mild. CONCLUSIONS: Tretinoin 0.05% lotion was significantly more effective than vehicle in achieving treatment success and reducing inflammatory and comedonal lesions in adult and adolescent females with moderate or severe acne. There appear to be age-related efficacy and tolerability benefits favoring adult females. J Drugs Dermatol. 2019;18(12):1218-1225. "

"Abstract: With the recognition in the 1960s and 1970s of the periodontopathic importance of the microbial biofilm and its specific anaerobic microorganisms, periodontitis was treated as an infectious disease (more recently, as a dysbiosis). Subsequently, in the 1980s, host-response mechanisms were identified as the mediators of the destruction of the collagen-rich periodontal tissues (gingiva, periodontal ligament, alveolar bone), and the periodontopathogens were now regarded as the ""trigger"" of the inflammatory/collagenolytic response that characterizes actively destructive periodontitis. Also at this time a new pharmacologic strategy emerged, entitled ""host-modulation therapy"", based on 2 major findings: (1) that the ability of tetracycline antibiotics to inhibit periodontal breakdown was due (in large part) to their previously unrecognized ability to inhibit the host-derived matrix metalloproteinases (notably, the collagenases, gelatinases, macrophage metalloelastase), and by mechanisms unrelated to the antimicrobial properties of these medications; and (2) that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as flurbiprofen, again by nonantimicrobial mechanisms, could reduce the severity of periodontitis (however, the adverse effects of long-term therapy precluded their development as safe and effective host-modulatory agents). Additional mechanistic studies resulted in the development of novel nonantimicrobial formulations (Periostat® [now generic] and Oracea®) and compositions of tetracyclines (notably chemically modified tetracycline-3) as host-modulator drugs for periodontitis, arthritis, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, cancer, and, more recently, for local and systemic bone loss in postmenopausal women. Identification of the cation-binding active site in the tetraphenolic chemically modified tetracycline molecules drove the development of a new category of matrix metalloproteinase-inhibitor compounds, with a similar active site, the biphenolic chemically modified curcumins. A lead compound, chemically modified curcumin 2.24, has demonstrated safety and efficacy in vitro, in cell culture, and in vivo in mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog models of disease. In conclusion, novel host-modulation compounds have shown significant promise as adjuncts to traditional local therapy in the clinical management of periodontal disease; appear to reduce systemic complications of this all-too-common ""inflammatory/collagenolytic"" disease; and Oracea® is now commonly prescribed for inflammatory dermatologic diseases.

"Abstract: Systemic cyclosporine A (CsA) therapy shows efficacy in the treatment of recalcitrant severe atopic dermatitis (AD) but elicits severe side-effects. Thus, a topical formulation of CsA nanocapsules (NCs), able to potentially bypass these drawbacks, was developed. CsA-NCs were shown to enhance drug penetration into the various layers of porcine ear skin. Furthermore, the encapsulated CsA was biologically active, as shown in vitro on mouse splenocytes, reflected by inhibition of both cell proliferation and of interleukin (IL)-2 secretion. Ex-vivo efficacy was demonstrated on human skin organ culture by markedly reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion. Finally, CsA-NCs topical formulation elicited improved efficacy in terms of better preservation of the skin barrier integrity, a decrease of the systemic pro-inflammation markers and reduced skin inflammation. The overall results suggest that this original topical platform may provide a novel therapeutic tool of clinical significance compared to the existing topical therapeutic drugs in AD. "

With this information, providers may minimize liability and maximize safety while caring for their patients. "
"Abstract: In this study we design green synthesis of a novel ZnO nanocarrier loaded with paclitaxel as a drug delivery system with high cytotoxicity against breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and low side effects on the normal cell line (fibroblast). Paclitaxel is formulated in high concentration in Cremophor EL because of its low solubility. Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) were prepared by the ethanolic extract of Camellia sinensis L., then coated with chitosan (Ch) and loaded with paclitaxel (PTX) to improve drug delivery. The physicochemical properties were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Drug loading on ZnO-Ch NPs was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In vitro apoptosis assay was assessed by flow cytometry. The cytotoxic effect of the nanocarrier drug was investigated using MTT assay in cancerous and normal cell lines. The PTX-loaded ZnO-Ch NPs showed cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 cells, with minimal detrimental effects on normal fibroblasts. The results of apoptosis assay were compliant with MTT findings. Generally, ZnO-Ch NPs could be used as a promising drug delivery platform for PTX with low side effect on normal cell line and high cytotoxic effect on breast cancer cell line. "
"Abstract: Hyperhidrosis is a dermatological condition defined by excessive sweating beyond thermoregulatory needs with significant effects on patients' quality of life. Hyperhidrosis is categorized as primary or secondary: primary hyperhidrosis is mostly focal and idiopathic, whereas secondary hyperhidrosis is commonly generalized and caused by an underlying medical condition or use of medications. Various surgical and nonsurgical therapies exist for primary hyperhidrosis. Although botulinum toxin is one of the deadliest toxins known, when used in small doses, it is one of the most effective therapies for primary hyperhidrosis. Botulinum toxin injections are widely used as a second-line primary hyperhidrosis treatment option once topical treatment strategies have failed. This article provides an overview of the commercially available botulinum toxin formulations and their applications in the treatment of primary hyperhidrosis. "
"Abstract: Damage to the drug diffusion coat barrier of controlled release pellets by the compaction force when preparing multiple-unit pellet system tablets is a major concern. Previous studies have shown that pellets located at the tablet axial and radial peripheral surfaces were more susceptible to damage when compacted due to the considerable shear encountered at these locations. Hence, this study was designed to assess with precision the impact of pellet spatial position in the compact on the extent of coat damage by the compaction force via a single pellet in minitablet (SPIM) system. Microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) pellet cores were consecutively coated with a drug layer followed by a sustained release layer. Chlorpheniramine maleate was the model drug used. Using a compaction simulator, the coated pellets were compacted singly into 3 mm diameter SPIMs with MCC as the filler. SPIMs with individual pellets placed in seven positions were prepared. The uncompacted and compacted coated pellets, as SPIMs, were subjected to drug release testing. The dissolution results showed that pellets placed at the top-radial position were the most susceptible to coat damage by the compaction force, while pellets positioned within the minitablet at the middle and upper quadrant positions showed the least damage. The SPIM system was found to be effective at defining the extent of coat damage to the pellet spatial position in the compact. This study confirmed that coated pellets located at the periphery were more susceptible to damage by compaction, with pellets located at the top-radial position showing the greatest extent of coat damage. However, if the pellet was completely encrusted by the cushioning filler, coat damage could be mitigated. Further investigations were directed at how the extent of coat damage impacted drug release. Interestingly, small punctures were found to be most detrimental to drug release whilst coats with large surface cuts did not completely fail. A damaged pellet coat has some self-sealing ability and failure is not total. Thus, this study provides a deeper understanding of the consequence of coat damage to drug release when sustained release coated pellets are breached. "

"BACKGROUND/AIMS: During dermatological forms development, one of the simplest non-invasive techniques used to evaluate cutaneous tolerance of formulations is to monitor the color changes using a tristimulus chromameter. Most published tolerance studies involving chromametric measurements are performed on Caucasian subjects. However, in the context of drug formulation for African-type populations, it is not always relevant to transpose tolerance results obtained on Caucasians populations to African-type ones due to histological ethnic differences of the skin. The goal of this work was to assess whether tristimulus chromameter can be used to highlight color variations following the application of dermatological topics on black skin in order to validate skin tolerance studies made on African-type subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After application of two commercial creams with opposite side effects (skin irritation and skin blanching) in both Africans and Caucasians populations, color variations were evaluated using a tristimulus chromameter in L RESULTS: While skin irritation resulted in a significant increase of a CONCLUSION: We established that tristimulus chromameter can be used to achieve in vivo skin tolerance study of dermatologic formulations in Africans despite their dark skin even though it appeared less sensitive. This study can speed up the development of dermatological forms dedicated to Africans and/or Caucasians subjects. "
"RATIONALE: Exposure to UV light can induce adverse effects on human health, such as photo-aging, immunosuppression, and cancer. Sunscreens are used to prevent the absorption of UV rays, but certain UV-filtering compounds have been shown to disrupt endocrine systems or act as carcinogens. To assess the effects of the exposure to such compounds, it is important to study the pathways by which they are biotransformed in the body. METHODS: Liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC/HRMS/MS) was employed to evaluate the oxidative metabolism and, specifically, the formation of reactive metabolites of six active ingredients commonly used in sunscreen formulations: oxybenzone, avobenzone, homosalate, octisalate, octocrylene, and octinoxate. In vitro incubations were performed with human and rat liver microsomes in the presence of β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and glutathione. An LC/HRMS/MS method was developed to identify metabolites employing a biphenyl reversed-phase column for separating parent molecules, metabolites, and glutathione (GSH) adducts. RESULTS: Each tested compound resulted in the formation of several metabolites, including at least one GSH adduct. Compounds containing ester groups were hydrolyzed, and some metabolites of the free acid forms were also detected. High-resolution MS/MS data was crucial for the structural elucidation of metabolites and GSH adducts. Fragmentation pathways were proposed for all parent compounds, as well as each described metabolite and adduct. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study will help better understand the metabolism and detoxification pathways of these xenobiotics. "
"Abstract: Management of degenerative spine pathologies frequently leads to the need for bone growth. Rehmanniae Radix (RR), a Chinese herbal formulation was found to exhibit numerous therapeutic properties including its potent effect against cancer cell lines. However, the underlying mechanism through which the Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) synthesized from Rehmanniae Radix exerts its anti-cancer activity against osteosarcoma cell line MG-63 needs to be explored. Therefore, the study was performed to evaluate the anticancer, cytotoxicity and apoptotic effectiveness of ZnONPs from RR against MG-63 cells. Characterization studies such UV-vis spectroscopy, FTIR, TEM and XRD analysis were performed. Cytotoxicity assay, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), morphological examination of cells and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and apoptosis inducing ability of RR were evaluated by various procedures. Western blot analysis of apoptotic markers such as Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9 were also performed. RR was found to inhibit growth of MG-63 cells at increasing dose. AO/EB staining confirmed the apoptotic efficacy of ZnONPs induced by RR in MG-63 cells. ZnONPs was also found to initiate increased generation of ROS and decreased MMP. Decreased MMP has resulted in increased levels of apoptotic proteins Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9 and induction of apoptosis was substantiated by western blot analysis. The outcomes of the work propose that ZnONPs from RR exhibits strong anticancer action and inducing apoptosis on MG-63 cells via stimulating increased generation of ROS. Thus, ZnONPs from RR might be used as a hopeful drug target against several types of cancer cell lines. "
"Abstract: The Biocompatibility and stability of nanoparticles using plants have been widely investigated due to its applications in the biomedical industry. Currently, there is a growing interest in nanoparticles in bone remodelling. Artemisia annua is an herbal plant commonly used in the treatment of various ailments. This study investigated the zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) using the green synthesis technique from A. annua and the effects of A. annua ZnO-NPs on osteoblast differentiation and inhibition of osteoclast formation. The formulated ZnO-NPs from A. annua were characterized by using various spectroscopic and microscopic methods Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and UV-Visible spectroscopy. The disc diffusion method was adopted to test the antimicrobial efficacy of ZnO-NPs. The viability of MG-63 cells were assayed by MTT test and Osteogenic-related assays like Real-time PCR and Mineralization assay were adopted to determine the effects of A. annua ZnO-NPs on the multiplication and differentiation of human osteoblast-like MG-63 cells. The characterization of A. annua ZnO-NPs revealed the crystalline nature with high zinc content and the presence of bioactive compounds from A. annua extract. The synthesized A. annua ZnO-NPs indicate significant antimicrobial potential. Besides, A. annua ZnO-NPs enhanced the proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization without causing significant cytotoxic impact on MG-63 cells. These effects indicate that A. annua ZnO-NPs can both stimulate bone formation via the differentiation of MG-63 cells. Hence, it was concluded that A. annua ZnO-NPs can be a promising agent for the treatment of bone deformities and bone-related diseases, however further research also required to explore the clear mechanism of A. annua ZnO-NPs in the formation and differentiation of MG-63 cells.

"Abstract: Background: There has been an increasing interest in gender and racial differences both in the pathogenesis and treatment of acne vulgaris (acne), and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) is a major concern in patients of color. Female acne patients report more anxiety and depression with acne improvement positively influencing Quality of Life (QoL) than their male counterparts, and there are differences in acne presentation. The first lotion formulation of tretinoin was developed using novel polymeric emulsion technology to provide an important alternative option to treat these acne patients, especially those who may be sensitive to the irritant effects of other tretinoin formulations. Objective: To determine the impact of gender and race on the efficacy and safety of tretinoin 0.05% lotion in treating moderate or severe acne. Methods: Post hoc analysis of 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 studies in moderate-to-severe acne. Subjects (aged 9 to 58 years, N=1640) were randomized (1:1) to receive tretinoin 0.05% lotion or vehicle, once-daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy assessments included changes in baseline inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions and treatment success (at least 2-grade reduction in Evaluator’s Global Severity Score [EGSS] and clear/almost clear). Quality of Life was assessed using the validated Acne QoL scale. Safety, adverse events (AEs), cutaneous tolerability, and hypo-/hyper-pigmentation (using a 4-point scale where 0=none and 3=severe) were evaluated at each study visit. Results: At week 12, mean percent reduction in inflammatory lesion counts were 56.9% and 53.4% respectively in female and male patients compared with 47.1% and 39.4% with vehicle (P≤0.001), with females statistically significant to males at week 8 [P=0.026]). Mean percent reduction in noninflammatory lesion counts in females and males were 51.7% and 46.1% respectively, compared with 34.9% and 29.7% with vehicle (P<0.001), with females statistically significant to males at week 12 (P=0.035). Treatment success was achieved by 23.6% and 16.1% of female and male patients treated with tretinoin 0.05% lotion by week 12 (P≤0.001 vs vehicle) with females statistically significant compared with males (P=0.013). Significant differences in inflammatory lesion count reductions were reported in Caucasian patients from week 8, and Black African/American male patients at week 12. Only male patients reported significant differences in both races in terms of noninflammatory lesions, and only Caucasian patients reported significant differences in treatment success. Female patients treated with tretinoin 0.05% lotion had statistically significant improvements in each Acne QoL domain (except role-social) compared with vehicle. Improvements in QoL in male subjects were only statistically different for acne symptoms. Tretinoin 0.05% lotion was well-tolerated in both genders. There were more treatment-related AEs in the female subpopulation, with a significantly greater incidence of skin dryness (P=0.006), that was more common in the younger Caucasian females. Conclusions: Tretinoin 0.05% lotion has been shown to be effective and well tolerated in moderate-to-severe acne. Treatment was significantly more effective in females than males. Tretinoin 0.05% lotion was well tolerated by both genders, although there was a higher incidence of treatment-related AEs, especially skin dryness, in females. There were racial and gender differences in QoL and beneficial effects on PIH in those patients most at risk. J Drugs Dermatol. 2019;18(11):1128-1138. "
"BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a disease that commonly manifests in adolescence. Up to half of adults with psoriasis develop it before the age of 20. Topical formulations containing corticosteroids and/or vitamin D3 analogs are recommended for treatment. OBJECTIVE: This phase II study aimed to evaluate the safety, including any potential effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and calcium metabolism, and efficacy of fixed-dose combination calcipotriene (0.005%) and betamethasone (0.064% as dipropionate) (Cal/BD) gel in adolescents with psoriasis. METHODS: Patients aged 12 to <17 years, with at least mild psoriasis on the body and scalp, received topical Cal/BD gel once daily for ≤8 weeks. Safety response criteria included adverse drug reactions [ADRs; any adverse event (AE) possibly or probably related to treatment as determined by the investigator; a primary response criterion] and AEs (a secondary response criterion). Only treatment-emergent AEs (events that occurred after the first application of Cal/BD gel or events which started before this and increased in intensity after the first application of Cal/BD gel) are presented here. Efficacy response criteria included controlled disease, by physician's global assessment of disease severity (PGA), following Cal/BD gel treatment. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients (median age 14 years; range 12-16) were enrolled and treated. Eight ADRs were observed in 7 (7%) patients and 38 (36%) patients experienced ≥1 AE. The most common AEs were headache [6 (6%) patients], nasopharyngitis [6 (6%) patients] and blood parathyroid hormone increased [4 (4%) patients]. One severe AE was reported (attempted suicide) but was considered unrelated to treatment. At the end of treatment, 58% of patients had controlled disease on the body and 69% on the scalp according to PGA. CONCLUSION: In this uncontrolled phase II study, Cal/BD gel was well tolerated and effective for treating scalp and body psoriasis in adolescents. "

"Abstract: Topical anesthetic agent causes transient insensibility to pain in a limited area of skin, and provides effective anesthesia in a short onset time, short duration, with seldom local or systemic side effects on intact skin and is simple to use. Topical formulations may offer significant benefits for prevention of procedural pain. Currently, they are considered to be the most effective anesthesia for laser treatments. Unfortunately, there is no standard anesthetic technique for this procedure. Lasers are being widely used in numerous dermatological and esthetics treatments in childhood. The advancement of new knowledge in laser technology have contributed to the development of new lasers that are commonly used in a pediatric population, such as Pulsed Dye, Carbon-dioxide and Nd:YAG laser. The most commonly used topical anesthetics in young patients for minimally or moderately painful laser cutaneous procedures are Lidocaine, Prilocaine, Tetracaine gel and combinations thereof. "
"Abstract: Benzoyl peroxide as a monotherapeutic and in combination with adapalene is a cornerstone of current acne therapy, but its unfavourable side effect profile reduces the therapeutic value of this compound. The incorporation into an adapalene-loaded microparticulate lipid matrix, which - via the principle of targeted erosion - allows the targeted release of active substances in the hair follicles, is a promising approach to reduce side effects such as skin redness, increased scaling and allergic reactions. However, there are challenges to the production of such a vehicle which require a galenic solution. That is in particular the redispersion of nanoparticulate benzoyl peroxide in lipids while maintaining its nanodisperse character. In the present work, the lamellar liquid crystalline phase of a binary water/phospholipid system is used to stabilize a nanosuspension during freeze-drying. Both after redispersing in water and after dispersing in nonpolar fat phases, the initial size of the nanosuspension was recovered with only minor deviations. The found cryoprotective effect of purified phospholipid allows the generation of highly concentrated solid-in-oil systems both in fat phases liquid at room temperature and in lipid melts, which after solidification can serve as starting material for the preparation of lipid microparticles loaded with benzoyl peroxide nanocrystals.

"Abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate the abatement power of oral microbial loading of a new gel formulation based on the complex silver-2-mercaptobenzoate, chlorhexidine digluconate and didecyldimethylammonium chloride (named ADC) through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The study sample consists of a group of 20 patients with chronic periodontal disease. Patients were over 25 years of age and did not undergo surgical or non-surgical periodontal treatment in the previous 6 months. The study sample was allotted into two groups of 10 patients each, homogeneous by age and sex. The test group received a bottle containing ADC gel, while the control group received an identical one containing placebo, similar to ADC in consistence, colour, taste and odour. Sub-gingival samples of four sites, one in each quadrant, of greatest probing depth in each patient were used. Microbiological analyses were performed at baseline and at day 15. Paired t test was performed to detect statistical significant reduction in total bacterial loading and oral pathogens in the study groups. The analysis showed a statistically significant reduction in the total bacterial loading evaluated pre- and post-treatment ( "
"BACKGROUND: Solar radiation causes skin damage through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). While UV filters effectively reduce UV-induced ROS, they cannot prevent VIS-induced (400-760 nm) oxidative stress. Therefore, potent antioxidants are needed as additives to sunscreen products. METHODS: We investigated VIS-induced ROS formation and the photoprotective effects of the Nrf2 inducer Licochalcone A (LicA). RESULTS: Visible spectrum of 400-500 nm dose-dependently induced ROS in cultured human fibroblasts at doses equivalent to 1 hour of sunshine on a sunny summer day (150 J/cm CONCLUSION: LicA may be a useful additive antioxidant for sunscreens.

"Abstract: Ondansetron hydrochloride (ODS) is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 antagonist for nausea and emesis prevention in neoplastic patients. To reduce dosing frequency and side effects and improve patient compliance, a sustained release parenteral formulation of ODS was developed. Microparticles of methylcellulose (MC) and ODS were prepared using the spray-drying method and suspended in oils to form oil suspensions. The formulations were evaluated for residual moisture, drug content, size distribution, DSC, XRD, FTIR, SEM, drug release, and pharmacokinetic studies. The effects of polymers and oils on the drug release were evaluated. MC showed the most prominent sustained release effect among various polymers examined with the optimum MC/ODS ratio of 2:1 (w/w). The particle size of the produced microparticles was in the mean diameter of approximately 3 μm. Physicochemical characterization suggested that ODS existed in an amorphous matrix within the microparticles and interacted with MC via hydrogen bonds. Corn oil was selected as the appropriate oil for suspension due to the sustained release of ODS and the appropriate viscosity. The optimized sustained release formulation of ODS was the corn oil suspension of spray-dried microparticles containing MC and ODS (2:1, w/w). It showed an in vitro drug sustained release up to 120 h, while the oil suspension of ODS without any polymer released the drug within 2 h. Following subcutaneous administration in rats, the optimized formulation could prolong the drug release until 72 h with the enhanced bioavailability in comparison with the ODS solution. The oil suspension of spray-dried microparticles might be an efficient approach for prolongation of the drug effect in the management of nausea and emesis. Graphical abstract. "
"BACKGROUND: Topical occlusive agents, such as petroleum jelly and silicone oils, kill head lice by coating and blocking its excretory system and are unlikely to induce treatment resistance. Although a popular alternative to neurotoxic pediculicides, their efficacy and safety remain unclear. METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, HERDIN (from inception to October 31, 2017), and other relevant sources for randomized controlled trials that compared topical occlusive agents with neurotoxic pediculicides to treat patients with head lice infestation. Using Cochrane collaboration methods, we selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and pooled similar studies. We assessed certainty of evidence using GRADEPro. RESULTS: Seventeen trials (N = 2005) testing occlusive agents met inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was moderate across trials, mainly from lack of blinding of participants and personnel. As a class, occlusive agents may be more pediculicidal than neurotoxic agents (final cure rate, RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.02, 1.41; 16 RCTs, N = 1779; I CONCLUSIONS: In treating head louse infestation, evidence suggests occlusive agents may be superior to or equally efficacious as neurotoxic pediculicides. Adverse effects are few and minor. Future trials should use appropriate comparators and consider effects of confounders such as neurotoxin resistance. Additionally, optimal occlusive formulation and dosing regimen need to be determined. "
"Abstract: Treatment of skin conditions with medicinal plants has been an ongoing human activity lasting over thousands of years. The use of specific plant species developed regionally, based on local flora. Commonly used medicinal plants for dermatological complaints are: Phlebodium aureum (L.) J. Sm., Ginkgo biloba L., Rosmarinus officinalis L., Panax ginseng C.A.Mey., Allium cepa L., Aloe vera (L.) Burm.f., Capsicum annuum L., Berbe ris aquifolium Pursh, Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze, and Podophyllum peltatum L. The demand for complementary therapeutics is an emerging trend due to the awareness of potential side effects that synthetic drugs might cause. More scientific evidence and better documentation are needed before advising dermatologic patients on herbal medicinal treatment. Standardised extracts and formulations with proven clinical efficacy should be developed for this cause. Here provided review entails the use of herbal medicinal products in the treatment of frequent chronic skin diseases, such as vitiligo, alopecia, psoriasis and genital warts. "
"BACKGROUND: DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection (DAXI) is a novel botulinum toxin type A formulation in clinical development. A phase 2 dose-ranging study identified an optimal dose and demonstrated efficacy with a median duration of 24 weeks. METHODS: In two phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2), subjects with moderate or severe glabellar lines at maximum frown were assigned randomly to receive placebo or 40 U of DAXI. Glabellar lines were evaluated at least every 4 weeks for at least 24 weeks until severity returned to baseline (≤36 weeks). RESULTS: Overall, 609 subjects were enrolled (DAXI, n = 405; placebo, n = 204). DAXI was significantly more effective than placebo in achieving the primary efficacy outcome (≥2-point improvement in glabellar line severity at maximum frown at week 4 according to both investigator and subject ratings): 73.6 percent versus 0.0 percent (SAKURA 1), and 74.0 percent versus 1.0 percent (SAKURA 2) (both p < 0.0001). Composite investigator and subject ratings of maximum frown after DAXI treatment showed that glabellar line severity of none or mild was maintained for a median of 24.0 weeks (SAKURA 1) and 23.9 weeks (SAKURA 2), and glabellar line severity did not return to baseline levels for a median of 27.7 and 26.0 weeks, respectively. DAXI was generally well tolerated, with the most common adverse events related to DAXI treatment being headache (SAKURA 1, 7.0 percent; SAKURA 2, 5.9 percent) and injection-site pain (5.0 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Results from both studies were highly consistent. DAXI may offer a prolonged duration of response (median, ≥24 weeks) and is generally well tolerated. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, I. "
"Abstract: Octocrylene or octocrilene is an organic ultraviolet (UV) filter which absorbs mainly UVB radiation and short UVA wavelengths. It is used in various cosmetic products to either provide an appropriate sun protection factor in sunscreen products or to protect cosmetic formulations from UV radiation. There is no discussion that UV filters are beneficial ingredients in cosmetics since they protect from skin cancer, but octocrylene has been recently incriminated to potentially induce adverse effects on the endocrine system in addition to having allergic and/or photoallergic potential. However, the substance has the advantage to work synergistically with other filters allowing a beneficial broad photoprotection, e.g. it stabilizes the UVA filter avobenzone (i.e. butylmethoxydibenzoylmethane). Like all chemicals used in cosmetics, the safety profile of octocrylene is constantly under assessment by the European Chemical Agency (ECHA) since it has been registered according to the European regulation Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals. Summaries of safety data of octocrylene are publicly available on the ECHA website. This review aims to present the main safety data from the ECHA website, as well as those reported in scientific articles from peer-reviewed journals. The available data show that octocrylene does not have any endocrine disruption potential. It is a rare sensitizer, photocontact allergy is more frequent and it is considered consecutive to photosensitization to ketoprofen. Based on these results, octocrylene can be considered as safe when used as a UV filter in cosmetic products at a concentration up to 10%. "

"Abstract: Nanoparticulate delivery systems have been noticed for chemotherapeutical delivery due to their ability in controlling the drug release and reducing the side effect. These systems could also be used to deliver two drugs or more simultaneously, inhibiting the development of resistant cancerous cells. Methotrexate (MTX), one of the most frequently used chemotherapeutic agent, and Curcumin (CUR), a natural chemopreventive compound, have shown promising results in treatment or controlling the progression of cancer. The aim of this study is to prepare and evaluate polymeric nanoparticles for co-delivery of MTX and CUR. The PLGA nanoparticles were prepared and characterized in respect of their particles size, morphology, drug encapsulation efficiencies, release patterns, cell cytotoxicity, and in vivo efficacy. Altering MTX and CUR amounts leads to particle size of 142.3 ± 4.07 nm with MTX encapsulation efficiency of 71.32 ± 7.8% and CUR encapsulation efficiency of 85.64 ± 6.3%. These particles showed significantly higher cytotoxicity in comparison with free MTX or CUR or even their solo-loaded formulations. The in vivo results showed the synergic effect of MTX and CUR co-delivery on inhibiting the progression of breast cancer. Considering the appropriate in vitro properties of acquired nanoparticles for controlled drug delivery and the satisfactory in vivo efficacy results, it seems that the prepared formulation is a promising candidate for further in vivo studies.

Abstract: Lanolin alcohol is a high cholesterol containing naturally derived material used as a skin protectant in wound healing petrolatum-based ointments. It is a highly purified fraction of lanolin wool wax that has been identified as a possible cause of allergic contact dermatitis. This 3-center study enrolled 499 subjects who underwent a variety of in-office surgical procedures followed by application of a wound healing ointment containing lanolin alcohol without antibiotics. No allergic contact dermatitis was identified in the 499 subjects who completed the study. The lack of allergic contact dermatitis observed may be due to the proprietary highly purified lanolin alcohol utilized in the study formulation. This is not the lanolin alcohol preparation found on the standard dermatology patch test tray. Not all lanolin alcohols are equal. This is an important consideration when examining the reported incidence of allergic contact dermatitis to lanolin alcohol and the absence of allergic contact dermatitis demonstrated in this research.

"INTRODUCTION: Nanoparticles (NPs) can be toxic due to their nano-range sizes. Zinc oxide (ZnO) has good biocompatibility and is commercially used in cosmetics. Moreover, ZnO NPs have potential biomedical uses, but their safety remains unclear. METHODS: A range of doped ZnO NPs was evaluated for antileishmanial activity and in vitro toxicity in brine shrimp and human macrophages, and N-doped ZnO NPs were evaluated for in vivo toxicity in male BALB/C mice. N-doped ZnO NPs were administered via two routes: intra-peritoneal injection and topically as a paste. The dosages were 10, 50, and 100 mg/kg/day for 14 days. RESULTS: Topical administration was safe at all dosages, but intra-peritoneal injection displayed toxicity at higher doses, namely, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day. The pathological results for the i.p. dose groups were mild to severe degenerative changes in parenchyma cells, increases in Kupffer cells, disappearance of hepatic plates, increases in cell size, ballooning, cytoplasmic changes, and nuclear pyknosis in the liver. Kidney histology was also altered in the i.p. administration group (dose 100 mg/kg/day), with inflammatory changes in the focal area. We associate pathological abnormalities with the presence of doped ZnO NPs at the diseased site, which was verified by PIXE analysis of the liver and kidney samples of the treated and untreated mice groups. CONCLUSION: The toxicity of the doped ZnO NPs can serve as an essential determinant for the effects of ZnO NPs on environmental toxicity and can be used for guidelines for safer use of ZnO-based nanomaterials in topical treatment of leishmaniasis and other biomedical applications.

"BACKGROUND: Topical corticosteroids are highly effective compounds that are now widely used in dermatology for the treatment of various autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Many corticosteroids are misused for diverse indications such as pigmentation, acne, pruritus, fungal or bacterial infections, rashes, and numerous other conditions. These products contain various constituents, most of which have hazards or toxic elements. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to raise awareness among individuals in the city of Basrah, Iraq about the uses and abuses of applying fake products to the face to inform the consumers about potential harmful adverse effects. METHODS: This study was a prospective multi-center clinic questionnaire of a demographic that involved the outpatient dermatology departments at the Al-Basrah teaching hospital and the Abu Al-Khaseeb hospital as well as the private clinics of two dermatology specialists in Basrah. A total of 235 patients with facial dermatoses secondary to the application of topical corticosteroids and counterfeit products or, a mixed formulation, for cosmetic purposes were recruited. RESULTS: Most enrolled patients were female with 10-20 years aged group. The majority applied these products due to friends or pharmacy encouragement. Motivations for the use of these products included: skin fairness, lightening, and general cosmetic. Interestingly, acne and erythema were common whilst, atrophy, dryness, telangiectasia, and hirsutism appear on long- term use only. CONCLUSION: The abuse of counterfeit cosmetic products and topical corticosteroids is in progress and they have adverse health events. There are many causes behind the abuse but the lack of education, lack of restriction, profitable for sellers and low prices are the main. "
"Abstract: Imbalance in skin microflora, particularly related to certain Cutibacterium acnes strains, may trigger acne. Application of non-acne-causing strains to the skin may modulate the skin microbiome and thereby lead to a reduction in acne. This pilot study evaluates the safety and efficacy of microbiome modulation on acne-prone skin. The study had 2 phases: active induction (5% benzoyl peroxide gel, 7 days) and interventional C. acnes strains treatment (5 weeks). Patients were randomized to either topical skin formulations PT1 (2 strains of C. acnes Single Locus Sequence Typing [SLST] type C3 and K8, 50% each) or PT2 (4 strains of C. acnes SLST type C3 [55%], K8 [5%], A5 [30%] and F4 [10%]). Safety and efficacy was evaluated in 14 patients (PT1=8/14, PT2=6/14). Skin microbiome composition shifted towards study formulations. No untoward adverse events, visible irritation, or significant flare-up were observed. Non-inflamed lesions and skin pH were reduced. Comedone counts improved clinically with no deterioration in inflammatory lesions. "
"Abstract: Congenital heart disease (CHD) has many forms and a wide range of causes. Clinically, it is important to understand the causes. This allows estimation of recurrence rate, guides treatment options, and may also be used to formulate public health advice to reduce the population prevalence of CHD. The recent advent of sophisticated genetic and genomic methods has led to the identification of more than 100 genes associated with CHD. However, despite these great strides, to date only one-third of CHD cases have been shown to have a simple genetic cause. This is because CHD can also be caused by oligogenic factors, environmental factors, and/or gene-environment interaction. Although solid evidence for environmental causes of CHD have been available for almost 80 years, it is only very recently that the molecular mechanisms for these risk factors have begun to be investigated. In this review, we describe the most important environmental CHD risk factors, and what is known about how they cause CHD. "
"BACKGROUND: The stratum corneum plays an important protective physiological role in providing a barrier to preventing skin desiccation and penetration of external agents. Emollients are used commonly to improve barrier function and skin hydration. AIMS: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of an emollient, V0034CR cream, and its active ingredients, to restore the cutaneous barrier. Secondary objectives included assessment of the moisturizing activity of each product and tolerance. The study was not designed to evaluate therapeutic benefit. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, 4-arm crossover, clinical pharmacology study, the full emollient V0034CR, its vehicle formulation alone, or with glycerol, or petrolatum, was applied to the forearms of healthy volunteers (n = 51) with dry skin (Kligman score of 2 or 3). Cutaneous permeability by Trans Epidermal Water Loss (TEWL) and skin moisture content by corneometry were serially measured for 12 hours following application. An analysis of variance with repeated measures was performed on the evolution of TEWL and corneometry. RESULTS: V0034CR emollient significantly reduced mean TEWL compared to vehicle (P = .0018) and vehicle + glycerol (P = .0001) and significantly increased mean corneometry scores compared to vehicle (P < .0001) and vehicle + petrolatum (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: The emollient V0034CR presented combined effects, with the petrolatum component improving skin barrier function, with a reduction in TEWL, and the glycerol component improving skin hydration.

"Abstract: Ageing is a natural phenomenon which is a fold, ridge and crease in the skin that occurs due to loss of body mass, poor hydration, disintegration of dermis and epidermis junction. The Skin ageing process involves many changes that occur due to the combination of both endogenous factors (gene mutation, cellular metabolism, and hormonal factor) and exogenous factors (U.V, pollutants, chemical, and toxins). In 1950, the number of older people were found to be almost 205 million across the globe. But this number almost got 4 times by the year 2012 and the number of older persons increased to a massive amount of 810 million. The ageing of the skin occurs due to various mechanisms like glycation, free radical, cell cycle, and cellular and molecular mechanism of skin ageing. In this review article, we have discussed the treatment, worldwide newer therapies and marketed formulation that are currently available for the reduction of skin ageing. The most promising and revolutionizing field of nanotechnology is mostly applied in the field of dermatology, cosmetics, and biomedical applications. Nanotechnology also plays a vital role in increasing the efficacy of the product. "
"Abstract: Liposomal drug delivery has become an established technology platform to deliver dual drugs to produce synergistic effects and reduce the adverse effects of traditional chemotherapy. Gambogic acid (GA) and retinoic acid (RA) are both effective anticancer components, but their low water-solubility (gambogic acid < 0.0050 mg/mL, retinoic acid 0.0048 < mg/mL) makes it difficult to load both drugs into the liposomes actively using the conventional method. We have successfully used solvent-assisted active loading technology (SALT) to load the insoluble drugs into the internal water phase via water-miscible organic solvent. Gambogic acid and retinoic acid co-encapsulated liposomes (weight ratio of GA to RA = 1:2, GRL) exhibited the strongest synergistic effect; combination index (CI) was 0.614 in 4T1 cells. Our studies demonstrated that GRL had uniform droplet size of about 130 nm, high stability, and controlled release behavior. GRL outperformed gambogic acid and retinoic acid solution (GRS) in pharmacokinetic profiles for a longer half-life and increased AUC. Comparing to GRS, GL, and RL, GRL showed increased cytotoxicity and apoptosis in 4T1 cells and showed the strongest anti-tumor ability in the in vivo anti-tumor efficacy. Overall, the SALT was a promising method to active loading poorly soluble drugs into liposomes, and the results showed GRL possessed a great potential for use in synergistic anticancer therapy. "
"BACKGROUND: Externally triggered drug delivery systems hold considerable promise for improving the treatment of many diseases, in particular, diseases where the spatial-temporal release of the drug is critical to maximize their biological effect whilst minimizing undesirable, off-target, side effects. RESULTS: Herein, we developed a light-triggerable formulation that takes advantage of host-guest chemistry to complex drugs functionalized with a guest molecule and release it after exposure to near infrared (NIR) light due to the disruption of the non-covalent host-guest interactions. The system is composed by a gold nanorod (AuNR), which generates plasmonic heat after exposure to NIR, a thin layer of hyaluronic acid immobilized to the AuNR upon functionalization with a macrocycle, cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]), and a drug functionalized with a guest molecule that interacts with the macrocycle. For proof of concept, we have used this formulation for the intracellular release of a derivative of retinoic acid (RA), a molecule known to play a key role in tissue development and homeostasis as well as during cancer treatment. We showed that the formulation was able to conjugate approximately 65 μg of RA derivative per mg of CB[6] @AuNR and released it within a few minutes after exposure to a NIR laser. Importantly, the bioactivity of RA released from the formulation was demonstrated in a reporter cell line expressing luciferase under the control of the RA receptor. CONCLUSIONS: This NIR light-triggered supramolecular-based modular platform holds great promise for theranostic applications. "
"Abstract: Acne is primarily an inflammatory disease. Anti-inflammatory dose doxycycline (40mg: 30mg immediate release and 10mg delayed release beads) is approved for the treatment of rosacea but with demonstrated efficacy for acne. Fixed combination adapalene 0.3% and benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel is a once-daily formulation approved for the topical management of acne vulgaris. It has both anti-inflammatory and anti-comedogenic properties. Options for management of severe acne are somewhat limited; many patients are not candidates for or refuse treatment with isotretinoin. Systemic antibiotics may be indicated; acne treatment guidelines emphasize antibiotic stewardship in light of increasing concerns about antibiotic resistance and call for the judicious use of conventional systemic antibiotics. This single-center, open label pilot study involving 20 subjects with severe acne assessed the effects of combination treatment using anti-inflammatory dose doxycycline plus adapalene 0.3% and benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel on IGA scores as well as inflammatory lesion, non-inflammatory lesion, and nodule counts. By week 12, 95% of subjects had at least a 2-grade improvement in IGA scores. Reductions in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts were statistically significant beginning at week 4 and continuing through week 12. By week 4, the percentage of patients with 0 nodules was 70%, compared to baseline of 20%. Further improvements were seen through week 12. Treatment was well-tolerated with no serious treatment-related adverse events. Combination treatment with anti-inflammatory dose doxycycline plus combination adapalene 0.3% and benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel is safe and effective for management of severe acne.

"Abstract: BACKGROUND: Acne is a common problem among Asian adolescents and adults. Generally, Asian skin is more pigmented, with a higher risk of acne sequelae. Potential for skin irritation and dryness, as well as pigmentary changes are key concerns that can have significant impact on Quality of Life (QoL). The first lotion formulation of tretinoin was developed using novel polymeric emulsion technology to provide an important alternative option to treat acne patients who may be sensitive to the irritant effects of other tretinoin formulations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of tretinoin 0.05% lotion in treating moderate-to-severe acne in an Asian population. METHODS: Post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 3 studies. Asian subjects (aged 12 to 48 years, N=69 with 61% female) were randomized (1:1) to receive tretinoin 0.05% lotion or vehicle, once-daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy assessments included changes in baseline inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions and treatment success (at least 2-grade reduction in Evaluator’s Global Severity Score [EGSS] and clear/almost clear). Quality of Life (QoL) was assessed using the validated Acne QoL scale. Safety, adverse events (AEs), cutaneous tolerability and hyper- or hypo-pigmentation (using 4-point scales where 0=none and 3=severe) were evaluated. RESULTS: At week 12, mean percent reduction in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts were 58.6% and 51.4% respectively compared with 41.5% and 23.9% with vehicle (P=0.012 for noninflammatory lesions from week 8). Treatment success was achieved by 27.2% of subjects treated with tretinoin 0.05% lotion by week 12. For each Acne QoL domain, changes from baseline achieved with tretinoin 0.05% lotion were statistically significant compared to vehicle. Only five subjects reported any AE; all AEs were mild or moderate and transient. There were no serious AEs (SAEs). There were no treatment-related AEs with tretinoin 0.05% lotion. There were slight transient increases in scaling and burning over the first 4-8 weeks. Mild hyperpigmentation was reported at baseline (mean score, 0.8) and remained mild throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS: Post hoc analysis showed that tretinoin 0.05% lotion was significantly more effective than its vehicle in achieving reductions in noninflammatory acne lesions and improvements in QoL in an Asian population. The novel lotion formulation was well-tolerated, with no treatment-related AEs and no concerns with skin dryness, irritation, or hyperpigmentation. J Drugs Dermatol. 2019;18(9):910-916. "
"Abstract: The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel assessed the safety of 14 citrus-derived peel oil ingredients and concluded that these ingredients are safe for use in cosmetic products when finished products, excluding rinse-off products, do not contain more than 0.0015% (15 ppm) 5-methoxypsoralen, and when formulated to be nonsensitizing and nonirritating. The citrus-derived peel oil ingredients are most frequently reported to function in cosmetics as fragrances and/or skin conditioning agents. The Panel reviewed the available animal and clinical data to determine the safety of these ingredients. Because final product formulations may contain multiple botanicals, each containing the same constituents of concern, formulators are advised to be aware of these constituents and to avoid reaching levels that may be hazardous to consumers. Industry should use good manufacturing practices to limit impurities that could be present in botanical ingredients. "
"Abstract: The organic UV filter benzophenone-3 (BP-3), widely used in the commercial formulations of sunscreens and personal care products, is considered an emerging pollutant and has been associated with several human and environmental health concerns. However, knowledge about their mode of action and ecotoxicity on aquatic biota is scarce. In this scenario, the objective of this work was to evaluate the genotoxic, mutagenic, and erythrotoxicity effects of BP-3 in the guppy Poecilia reticulata after acute exposure. Adult females of P. reticulata were exposed to three non-lethal and environmentally relevant concentrations of BP-3 (10, 100, and 1000 ng L "
"Abstract: This review addresses a major question of importance to pharmaceutical scientists: how can novel drug delivery systems play a role in maximizing the UV protection of sunscreens? Because more and more people are being diagnosed with skin cancer each year than all other cancers combined, adequate sun protective measures are pivotal. In this context, the present review is to give an up-to-date overview on the different nanocarrier systems that have been explored so far for encapsulating different types of UV filters present on the market. The aim of these carrier systems is to prevent skin penetration and to enhance the photoprotective potential of sunscreen actives. For each supramolecular system, a brief description along with the studies, achievements, and pitfalls, on the type of UV actives inside them, ranging from classical UV filters to new generation of UV actives is given. A brief overview of UV filters encapsulated in microcarriers is also discussed. "

"Abstract: Curcumin is a compound isolated from turmeric, a plant known for its medicinal use. Recently, there is a growing interest in the medical community in identifying novel, low-cost, safe molecules that may be used in the treatment of inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. An increasing amount of evidence suggests that curcumin may represent an effective agent in the treatment of several skin conditions. We examined the most relevant in vitro and in vivo studies published to date regarding the use of curcumin in inflammatory, neoplastic, and infectious skin diseases, providing information on its bioavailability and safety profile. Moreover, we performed a computational analysis about curcumin's interaction towards the major enzymatic targets identified in the literature. Our results suggest that curcumin may represent a low-cost, well-tolerated, effective agent in the treatment of skin diseases. However, bypass of limitations of its in vivo use (low oral bioavailability, metabolism) is essential in order to conduct larger clinical trials that could confirm these observations. The possible use of curcumin in combination with traditional drugs and the formulations of novel delivery systems represent a very promising field for future applicative research. "
"Abstract: Topical sunscreen products are universally applied by numerous individuals to protect their skin from the detrimental effects of UV radiation. However, lately, studies have revealed the risks associated with percutaneous absorption of UV filters leading to undesirable systemic side effects such as hormonal disturbances and allergies. In this study, an innovative sunscreen formulation was developed based on starch microsponges as a key carrier encapsulating an organic sunscreen benzophenone‑3. The developed starch microsponges were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis. The results showed that starch microsponges possessed a high BET surface area (85.45 m "
"Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex mental illness with unmet therapeutic needs. The antidepressant effects of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have been widely reported. The subcommittee of the International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry Research organized an expert panel and conducted a literature review and a Delphi process to develop a consensus-based practice guideline for clinical use of n-3 PUFAs in MDD. The guideline focuses on 5 thematic areas: general concepts, acute treatment strategy, depression recurrence monitoring and prevention, use in special populations, and potential safety issues. The key practice guidelines contend that: (1) clinicians and other practitioners are advised to conduct a clinical interview to validate clinical diagnoses, physical conditions, and measurement-based psychopathological assessments in the therapeutic settings when recommending n-3 PUFAs in depression treatment; (2) with respect to formulation and dosage, both pure eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or an EPA/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) combination of a ratio higher than 2 (EPA/DHA >2) are considered effective, and the recommended dosages should be 1-2 g of net EPA daily, from either pure EPA or an EPA/DHA (>2:1) formula; (3) the quality of n-3 PUFAs may affect therapeutic activity; and (4) potential adverse effects, such as gastrointestinal and dermatological conditions, should be monitored, as well as obtaining comprehensive metabolic panels. The expert consensus panel has agreed on using n-3 PUFAs in MDD treatment for pregnant women, children, and the elderly, and prevention in high-risk populations. Personalizing the clinical application of n-3 PUFAs in subgroups of MDD with a low Omega-3 Index or high levels of inflammatory markers might be regarded as areas that deserve future research. "
"Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a shining beacon in the realm of photomedicine, is a non-invasive technique that utilizes dye-based photosensitizers (PSs) in conjunction with light and oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species to combat malignant tissues and infectious microorganisms. Yet, for PDT to become a common, routine therapy, it is still necessary to overcome limitations such as photosensitizer solubility, long-term side effects (e.g., photosensitivity) and to develop safe, biocompatible and target-specific formulations. Polymer based drug delivery platforms are an effective strategy for the delivery of PSs for PDT applications. Among them, hydrogels and 3D polymer scaffolds with the ability to swell in aqueous media have been deeply investigated. Particularly, hydrogel-based formulations present real potential to fulfill all requirements of an ideal PDT platform by overcoming the solubility issues, while improving the selectivity and targeting drawbacks of the PSs alone. In this perspective, we summarize the use of hydrogels as carrier systems of PSs to enhance the effectiveness of PDT against infections and cancer. Their potential in environmental and biomedical applications, such as tissue engineering photoremediation and photochemistry, is also discussed. "

"Abstract: Avobenzone (AVO), oxybenzone (OXY), and octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC), are widely used UV filters. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of incorporation in mesoporous silica (SBA-15) on their cutaneous deposition and permeation. Stick formulations containing ""free"" and ""incorporated"" UV filters (SF1 and SF2, respectively) were prepared and characterized with respect to their physicochemical, thermal, and functional properties. Cutaneous delivery experiments using porcine skin with quantification by UHPLC-MS/MS, demonstrated that skin deposition of AVO and OXY after application of SF2 for 6 and 12 h was significantly lower than that from SF1 at each time-point (Student t-test, p < 0.05): e.g. OXY permeation across the skin was 30-, 12- and 1.5-fold lower after 6, 12 and 24 h, respectively, following application of SF2. Cutaneous biodistribution profiles of AVO and OXY to 800 µm evidenced a significant decrease in the amounts in the viable epidermis and dermis. In contrast, deposition of the more lipophilic OMC was not significantly different (p ˃ 0.05). In vitro photoprotective efficacy results demonstrated that adsorption/entrapment of UV filters enhanced the sun protection factor by 94%. In conclusion, SBA-15, an innovative mesoporous material, increased photoprotection by UV filters while reducing their cutaneous penetration and transdermal permeation. "
"Abstract: BACKGROUND: A novel foam formulation of halobetasol propionate, 0.05% (HBP-Foam) has been developed to treat plaque psoriasis in patients who prefer a thermostable topical foam with low application shear that allows for easier coverage over large and/or hirsute areas than existing formulations. OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and effectiveness of HBP-Foam in subjects with plaque psoriasis. METHODS: Two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical studies were conducted in 560 adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Subjects applied the assigned test article to all psoriatic plaques twice daily for 14 days. The key efficacy measures were the proportion of subjects with “treatment success,” defined as those subjects that achieved a score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and at least a two-grade improvement compared to baseline for the Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) and for the clinical signs of psoriasis (plaque elevation, scaling, and erythema) as well as pruritus. Safety measurements included adverse events and local skin reactions in the treatment area. RESULTS: HBP-Foam was statistically superior to vehicle in achieving “Treatment Success” in 25.3% and 30.7% vs 3.9% and 7.4% (P<0.001) in Studies 1 and 2, respectively. Pruritus scores statistically improved by over 30% in HBP-Foam treated subjects. In addition, these subjects experienced a significant reduction in the clinical signs of psoriasis (plaque elevation, scaling, and erythema). In contrast, in the vehicle groups the decrease in psoriasis-related signs was generally not observed. Safety outcomes were unremarkable and similar in both the HBP-Foam and vehicle treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of HBP-Foam in the treatment of plaque psoriasis. Furthermore, this novel foam formulation has demonstrable for its ease of application over large and/or hairy treatment areas. ClinicalTrials.gov Registration: NCT02742441 NCT02368210 "
"Abstract: To assess photoxicity, several in vitro methods using different cellular models have been developed for preclinical testing. Over prediction of the in vivo photosafety hazard has been however appointed. Herein, we describe the implementation and validation of an in vitro methodology for phototoxicity evaluation based on the 3T3 neutral red uptake phototoxicity test using the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line, and UVA/UVB radiation. Known positive (5-methoxypsoralen, chlorpromazine, and quinine) and negative (acetyl salicylic acid, hexachlorophene, and sodium lauryl sulphate) controls were tested together with a set of chemical currently used in cosmetic/pharmaceutical formulations. Apart from the advantage of using a cell line of human origin, these cells were generally more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of the test substances relative to the 3T3 mouse fibroblasts when exposed to an UVA irradiation dose of 1.7 mW/cm "

"Abstract: Retinoblastoma is a malignant tumor of the retina in infants. Conventional therapies are associated to severe side effects and some of them induce secondary tumors. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) thus appears as a promising alternative as it is nonmutagenic and generates minimal side effects. The effectiveness of PDT requires the accumulation of a photosensitizer (PS) in the tumor. However, most porphyrins are hydrophobic and aggregate in aqueous medium. Their incorporation into a nanocarrier may improve their delivery to the cell cytoplasm. In this work, we designed biodegradable liponanoparticles (LNPs) consisting of a poly(d,l)-lactide (PDLLA) nanoparticle coated with a phospholipid (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl- "
"BACKGROUND: Facial chemical exfoliation (peeling) involves using a chemical agent to insult the skin and damage the cutaneous barrier, to reduce the signs of aging. The use of a moisturizer is advised postprocedure to promote repair of the epidermis. Biomimic moisturizer formulations may be effective treatment options for repair following facial peeling. AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the local tolerance and cosmetic efficacy of three topical moisturizers (Physiogel® moisturizing creams), used after a 70% glycolic acid facial peel. METHODS: Three randomized, evaluator-blind, parallel group studies were performed. Subjects were healthy females aged 30-60 years with moderate to advanced photoaged skin (Glogau photoaging type II-III). All included a screening visit, a 7-day washout period, a 70% glycolic acid facial peeling procedure, and randomization to a 14-day treatment period with one of the three test products vs control. RESULTS: The primary endpoint was reached in all three studies; all completed subjects in the test groups received a favorable dermatologist global assessment score for tolerance at Day 14 (postchemical peel). Secondary assessments of local tolerance based on dermatologist and subject self-assessment scores demonstrated improvements from baseline. No treatment-related adverse events were reported in any study. Benefits for the test products were also observed in secondary efficacy analyses of transepidermal water loss and moisturization. CONCLUSIONS: These studies have demonstrated the local tolerance and cosmetic efficacy of three moisturizing skin care products, when used for skin recovery after superficial chemical peeling on the face.

"BACKGROUND: Keratoconjunctivitis sicca affects 5% to 33% of the population and is often accompanied by symptoms such as burning and dryness. This pooled analysis evaluated total and central corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) in patients receiving OTX-101 0.09% or vehicle in phase 2b/3 and 3 studies and whether improvements in corneal staining correlated with improved visual acuity. METHODS: In these randomized, vehicle-controlled studies, patients received 1 drop of OTX-101 or vehicle in both eyes twice daily. Corneal staining was performed at baseline and days 28, 56, and 84. CFS was evaluated in each zone (0-to-4 scale); total corneal staining (0-to-20 scale per eye) was averaged over both eyes. Pooled safety assessments included adverse event monitoring. RESULTS: Mean baseline CFS total scores (SD) were 4.2 (2.5) and 4.3 (2.6) for the OTX-101 (n = 523) and vehicle (n = 525) groups, respectively. For total corneal staining, least squares mean changes from baseline (standard error) were -0.9 (0.08) versus -0.5 (0.08) for OTX-101 and vehicle, respectively (P = 0.0008), on day 28 and -1.4 (0.09) versus -0.9 (0.09) on day 84 (P = 0.0002). There was a significantly high correlation (P = 0.0117) between reduced central corneal staining and improved visual acuity on day 84. Treatment-related adverse events were mostly mild, with instillation site pain reported by 21.8% and 4.0% of patients receiving OTX-101 and vehicle, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with OTX-101 led to greater improvements versus vehicle in corneal surface staining as early as 4 weeks, and further improvements were seen up to 12 weeks. OTX-101 was well tolerated in patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca. "
"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Paediatric skin, considered sensitive, and infant skin, more susceptible to percutaneous toxicity, require specially formulated cosmetic products. As recently shown, early use of emollients in infants ""at risk"" of developing atopic dermatitis has shown controversial results in reducing the incidence of atopic dermatitis. Development of dermo-cosmetic products for this specific population should especially ensure tolerance and safety. In absence of good clinical practice guideline, we propose here a stepwise approach for the development of paediatric cosmetic skincare products. METHODS: Our stepwise methodology for cosmetics aimed at paediatrics, starts with in vitro assessment of product's ingredients safety, followed by preclinical and clinical evaluations of the final product, including sequentially: (1) Repeated Open Application Test (ROAT), (2) Human Repeated Insult Patch Test (HRIPT), (3) In-use dermatological and ophthalmological tolerance studies (sequentially in 3a: healthy adults, 3b: healthy paediatric subjects and finally 3c: paediatric patients). We also describe the integrated cosmetovigilance-toxicological surveillance during the clinical development phase and postmarketing. RESULTS: As illustrated with one dermo-cosmetic product intended to be used as a preventative/maintenance treatment for atopic dermatitis in paediatric population, we show that using this stepwise methodology to test a product reduces potential risks of irritation and contact dermatitis in this sensitive population. CONCLUSION: Standardized ethical stepwise development approach is needed to ensure the commercialization of safe and well-tolerated dermo-cosmetics for paediatrics. The approach described here could potentially serve as guidance for evaluation of new paediatric cosmetic products. "
"BACKGROUND: Tranilast [N-(3,4-dimethoxycinnamoyl) anthranilic acid] has never been investigated for the prevention and treatment of acne scars. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of tranilast 8% gel in improving the final appearance of patients with acne scarring concomitantly treated by isotretinoin. METHODS: This was a prospective, double-blind, split-face study, which enrolled 40 otherwise healthy participants (aged 18-49 years) with facial acne scars. For each patient, one half of the face were treated with tranilast 8% liposomal gel and the other half with a water-based placebo. Using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS), acne scars were evaluated by two dermatologists and by the patients, and the patients also rated their satisfaction with the treatment and reported adverse effects. RESULTS: In total, 32 participants completed the trial. The mean GAIS scores at 5 months post-treatment were significantly lower (better outcome) for the tranilast-treated side than the placebo-treated areas in patients concomitantly treated with isotretinoin (P < 0.001). All the isotretinoin-treated patients reported greater satisfaction and better general improvement in the skin's appearance and texture, and also greater improvement of pigment and redness on the tranilast 8% gel-treated side compared with the control side. CONCLUSION: Combined topical application of tranilast 8% gel twice daily with oral isotretinoin treatment in the active phase of acne vulgaris may result in fewer scars, finer skin texture and enhanced appearance.

"Abstract: Background: Tazarotene has been extensively studied in clinical trials and is widely used to treat acne vulgaris (acne). Irritation potential has limited its use. Objective: To compare efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a novel formulation tazarotene 0.045% lotion based on polymeric emulsion technology, and tazarotene 0.1% cream in patients with moderate-to-severe acne. Methods: A total of 210 patients, 12 years and older were randomized to receive tazarotene 0.045% lotion, tazarotene 0.1% cream, or respective vehicle in double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled, 12-week study evaluating safety and efficacy (inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts and using Evaluator Global Severity Scores [EGSS]). In addition, patients completed a patient satisfaction survey (PSS), and acne-specific quality of life (QoL) questionnaire. Safety and cutaneous tolerability were assessed throughout. Results: A novel tazarotene 0.045% lotion demonstrated statistically significant superiority to vehicle in reducing inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts (P=.006 and P<.001) and clearly more effective in treatment success at week 12. In addition, at less than half the concentration, tazarotene 0.045% lotion was numerically more effective than tazarotene 0.1% cream. Mean percent reductions in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions were 63.8% and 56.9%, compared with 60.0% and 54.1% with tazarotene 0.1% cream at week 12. Treatment success assessed by the investigator or patients’ self-assessment was also numerically greater with tazarotene 0.045% lotion. There were no significant differences in patient satisfaction or QoL between the two active treatments. Both were well-tolerated, however, there were more treatment-related adverse events with tazarotene 0.1% cream (5.6% versus 2.9%); most common being application site pain. Limitations: This study was primarily designed to direct the phase 3 program and some of the results are post hoc analyses. Conclusions: A novel tazarotene 0.045% lotion provides statistically significant greater efficacy than vehicle in terms of lesion reduction, and numerically better treatment success than tazarotene 0.1% cream; with a highly favorable safety and tolerability profile in moderate-to-severe acne patients.

"Abstract: Concern has been raised regarding the use of simethicone, a de-foaming agent, during endoscopic procedures. Following reports of simethicone residue in endoscope channels despite high level disinfection, an endoscope manufacturer recommended that it not be used due to concerns of biofilm formation and a possible increased risk of microorganism transmission. However, a detailed mucosal assessment is essential in performing high-standard endoscopic procedures. This is impaired by bubbles within the gastrointestinal lumen. The Gastroenterological Society of Australia's Infection Control in Endoscopy Guidelines (ICEG) Committee conducted a literature search utilizing the MEDLINE database. Further references were sourced from published paper bibliographies. Following a review of the available evidence, and drawing on extensive clinical experience, the multidisciplinary ICEG committee considered the risks and benefits of simethicone use in formulating four recommendations. Published reports have documented residual liquid or crystalline simethicone in endoscope channels after high level disinfection. There are no data confirming that simethicone can be cleared from channels by brushing. Multiple series report benefits of simethicone use during gastroscopy and colonoscopy in improving mucosal assessment, adenoma detection rate, and reducing procedure time. There are no published reports of adverse events related specifically to the use of simethicone, delivered either orally or via any endoscope channel. An assessment of the risks and benefits supports the continued use of simethicone during endoscopic procedures. Strict adherence to instrument reprocessing protocols is essential. "
"Abstract: We recently found that the dietary long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-ω-3 PUFA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), showed enhanced antineoplastic activity against colon cancer cells if encapsulated in resveratrol-based solid lipid nanoparticles (RV-SLNs). In the present study, we investigated whether the DHA enclosed in RV-SLNs (DHA-RV-SLNs) could have the potential of attenuating irritation and inflammation caused by environmental factors at the skin level. To this aim, we used two keratinocyte lines (HaCaT and NCTC 2544 cells) and exposed them to the cytotoxic action of the surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), as an in vitro model of irritation, or to the pro-inflammatory activity of the cytokine TNF-α. We found that DHA enclosed in RV-SLNs significantly enhanced its ability to contrast the cytotoxic effect of SDS and to inhibit the SDS- and TNF-α-induced production of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and 1 MCP-1, in the two keratinocyte cell lines, as well as the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Moreover, it more efficiently reduced the upsurge of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels obtained in the presence of a pro-oxidant (H "

"Abstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) contributes to almost one third of all trauma-related deaths, and those that survive often suffer from long-term physical and cognitive deficits. Ciclosporin (cyclosporine, cyclosporin A) has shown promising neuroprotective properties in pre-clinical TBI models. The Copenhagen Head Injury Ciclosporin (CHIC) study was initiated to establish the safety profile and pharmacokinetics of ciclosporin in patients with severe TBI, using a novel parenteral lipid emulsion formulation. Exploratory pharmacodynamic study measures included microdialysis in brain parenchyma and protein biomarkers of brain injury in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Sixteen adult patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale 4-8) were included, and all patients received an initial loading dose of 2.5 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion for 5 days. The first 10 patients received an infusion dosage of 5 mg/kg/day whereas the subsequent 6 patients received 10 mg/kg/day. No mortality was registered within the study duration, and the distribution of adverse events was similar between the two treatment groups. Pharmacokinetic analysis of CSF confirmed dose-dependent brain exposure. Between- and within-patient variability in blood concentrations was limited, whereas CSF concentrations were more variable. The four biomarkers, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament light, tau, and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1, showed consistent trends to decrease during the 5-day treatment period, whereas the samples taken on the days after the treatment period showed higher values in the majority of patients. In conclusion, ciclosporin, as administered in this study, is safe and well tolerated. The study confirmed that ciclosporin is able to pass the blood-brain barrier in a TBI population and provided an initial biomarker-based signal of efficacy. "
"SCOPE: Overexposure to the ultraviolet radiation may trigger the development of adverse health effects such as the appearance of burns, blemishes, skin aging and skin cancer. These harmful effects on health can be minimized with daily application of photoprotective products or multifunctional products. Medicinal plants may present potential for sun protection and among the species of Brazilian flora, we can highlight the species of the genus Campomanesia. In this context, the photoprotective potential of Campomanesia guazumifolia, Campomanesia sessiliflora, Campomanesia xanthocarpa and Campomanesia adamantium were evaluated. METHODS AND RESULTS: The ethanolic extracts of C. guazumifolia (CG), C. sessiliflora (CS), C. xanthocarpa (CX) and C. adamantium (CA) showed absorption in the UVA and UVB regions. At the concentration of 8%, all the extracts presented sun protection factor (SPF) values higher than 2 and in the concentration of 4% only CA and CX. All plant extracts, alone or in combination, had increased the SPF with the incorporation of octyl methoxynnamate (OM). The samples that presented the highest SPF values contain the association of CA and CX. During the preliminary stability study, the formulations (SSPFOM4, SSPFCX4CA4OM4 and SSPFCX4CA4) presented SPF and pH values statistically different (p < 0.05) between temperatures. CONCLUSION: The formulation SSPFCX4CA4 presented SPF values >6, so they present potential for photoprotective or multifunctional products. "
"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers are at risk for occupational chronic hand eczema (CHE) because of frequent handwashing and prolonged use of occlusive gloves. Prevention programs based on skin care education have been shown to be beneficial. We developed and assessed the efficacy of a skin care educational intervention for healthcare workers of our hospital. METHODS: The intervention consisted of two sessions, one week apart, each divided in a theoretical and a practical part, focusing on the skin barrier, types of eczema, risk factors for CHE, hand hygiene measures respectful of the skin, proper use of protective gloves and emollient creams. Its efficacy was assessed by a questionnaire, administered before and after the intervention, investigating the participants' knowledge of risk factors for CHE and risk behaviors. RESULTS: Twenty-three subjects, mostly (65.2%) nurses, took part in the intervention; 60.9% had a self-reported atopic background and 65.2% participants reported a history of CHE. The intervention improved significantly the participants' knowledge on CHE risk factors, i.e. frequent handwashing (P=0.023), surgical scrubbing (P=0.016) and prolonged glove wearing (P=0.022). The frequency of hand washing was significantly reduced (P=0.022). The participants gave a positive unanimous feedback. CONCLUSIONS: Our intervention was effective, by significantly improving the participants' knowledge and by inducing significant behavioral changes. Improving the formulation of alcoholic hand rubs may be a key factor to encourage their use. Coexisting nonoccupational risk behaviors are just as important in the prevention of CHE. "
"Abstract: Acne vulgaris is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide with the high prevalence ratio of about 80-85% in patients who are in puberty period. For the treatment options, many conventional dosage forms are available; however, existing limitations of systemic administration of drugs (oral antibiotics), such as adverse events and resistance, led for seek of new formulation options. In this study, liposomes containing tetracycline HCl and tretinoin were prepared by the film formation method.  "
"BACKGROUND: There are many postprocedure skin care options, but no consensus on the best formulation to optimize healing. Silicone gels have only been used to treat keloids and hypertrophic scars and typically applied after the wound has healed. This study compared the healing response after fractional ablative erbium laser resurfacing with a petrolatum-based ointment and a silicone gel. METHODS: A randomized, open-label, split-face study was performed. Ten subjects underwent Erbium:YAG (Sciton) fractional laser resurfacing. Patients were randomized to apply a petrolatum-based gel or a silicone gel (Stratacel RESULTS: All subjects healed without complications. By day 60, there was no difference in signs and symptoms of healing between the two different dressing approaches. However, patients treated with the silicone gel had less post-treatment erythema and hyperpigmentation. CONCLUSIONS: A novel silicone gel resulted in reduced signs of erythema and hyperpigmentation postprocedure, without an increase in adverse events. Additionally, the silicone gel dries to form a thin, full contact film and can be covered with sunscreen or cosmetics once dry. This new silicone gel presents a good option for postprocedure care after ablative fractional laser resurfacing. "
"OBJECTIVE: Skin aging is a complex process influenced by several factors that cause DNA damage and alter the extracellular matrix. The anti-inflammatory drug piroxicam can counteract photocarcinogenesis and photoaging by blocking cyclooxygenases-1 and 2, matrix metalloproteinases, and ornithine decarboxylase, and inducing apoptosis. METHODS: We conducted an open observational study in 50 adults with moderate to severe signs of photoaging treated with a new local formulation of piroxicam 0.8% plus sunscreen for 16 weeks. Photoaging was assessed using a validated dermoscopic photoaging scale. Each patient’s own perception of their skin quality was assessed using a graphic scale. RESULTS: The new formulation demonstrated a reliable effect on photoaging after 16 weeks, based on improved median dermoscopic photoaging and skin-quality scores. No patients experienced any adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence for the safe and effective use of a local piroxicam formulation for the treatment of moderate to severe photoaging.

"Abstract: Methotrexate (MTX) was originally formulated as one of the first antitumour drugs due to its ability to alter folate metabolism, which renders it to be an antiproliferative agent. Classically, the higher dosage is administered via parenteral route, in a cyclical fashion, to achieve antitumour effects. Patients on high doses of MTX are prone to develop rare complications of myelosuppression and pancytopenia, in a dose-dependent fashion, secondary to altered folate metabolism.  "
"BACKGROUND: Premature skin aging results from exposure to a range of environmental factors, primarily ultraviolet radiation, but also high-energy visible light in the blue spectrum, infrared radiation, and environmental pollution. These extrinsic factors result in the generation of reactive oxygen species which promote photoaging and DNA damage resulting in skin cancers. AIMS: To formulate skincare products utilizing a new coating applied to zinc oxide and titanium dioxide particles and complimentary skincare ingredients to provide broad protection against a range of environmental insults. METHODS: A cross-polymer, multifunctional coating of silicate, polyalkylsilsesquioxane, and polydimethylsiloxane moieties increases the photostability and decreases the reactivity of mineral sunscreen agents when interacting with energy sources. These products are also formulated with antioxidants to minimize free radical propagation. Additionally, this coating improves the esthetic feel of mineral sunscreens, while the appearance is enhanced by formulating products with a blend of iron oxides. RESULTS: A series of in vitro and ex vivo studies demonstrated the ability of mineral-based products formulated with the new multifunctional coating to provide protection against ultraviolet radiation, high-energy visible light, infrared radiation, and environmental pollution. CONCLUSION: Newly formulated mineral-based skincare products provide environmental protection, are ecologically safe, and can replace chemical-based sunscreen ingredients. "
"Abstract: The present study is aimed at the development of a sunscreen cream for use in high altitude areas which have been found to possess superior sun protection factor (SPF) along with remarkable antioxidant activity. The topical formulation is a standard oil-in-water emulsion of a combination of United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) approved ultraviolet filters; along with melatonin and pumpkin seed oil. The in-silico optimized formulation was characterized using established methods and the stability study was carried out as per International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. The formulation was prepared after requisite pre-formulation analysis by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetric and thermogravimetric analyses; followed by characterization based on color, odor, phase separation, spreadability, specific gravity, homogeneicity, centrifugation and sensitivity. For the stability study, a total of three samples from three batches of the finished product were subjected to the stability study. The samples were analyzed for content uniformity, pH,  "
"Abstract: Current treatments for glioblastoma have failed to significantly increase patient survival, are extremely cytotoxic, can cause severe side effects, and are ineffective. Given these limitations, drugs other than cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents are being explored. Recent studies show that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) could be effective on cancer cells as they have been shown to suppress carcinogenesis in a variety of tumor types and can reverse premalignant lesions and inhibit the development of secondary tumors in the head and neck of cancer patients. However, the therapeutic effects of retinoids such as ATRA are undermined by its rapid in vivo metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes, difficulty in crossing the blood-brain barrier, and sensitivity to isomerization/degradation. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a porous poly(1,8-octanediol-co-citrate; POC) wafer that stabilizes all-trans retinoic acid, while slowly releasing ATRA over 3 months. Release of ATRA from POC wafers inhibited proliferation of U87MG (glioblastoma) cells and caused upregulation in genes associated with differentiation into normal phenotype and apoptosis. Therefore, ATRA eluting poly(diol citrate) wafers are a promising treatment option compared to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. "
"Abstract: In this project methotrexate (MTX) conjugated albumin based nanoparticles (MTX-BSA) loaded with curcumin (CUR) drug (CUR-MTX-BSA) for simultaneous delivery of multi-chemotherapeutic drugs and combination cancer therapy were designed. Co-delivery is a new strategy which minimize the amount of each drug, reduce of side effects and also to achieve the synergistic effect for cancer therapies. The MTX was conjugated to albumin via covalent bond. Next, this synthesized prodrug loaded with CUR. Afterward, the formulations were evaluated for physical and chemical properties by DLS, TEM, FTIR, UV/Vis, DSC analysis, in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo biocompatibility studies. Furthermore, the drug loading and release study were evaluated. Proteinase K enzyme was used to break amid bond between MTX and BSA and also amidic bonds in BSA structure. Administration of up to 2000 mg/kg of BSA to healthy animals was non-toxic and all treated mice were still alive after 24 h. The result of this study proved that CUR-MTX-BSA can be used as a proficient vehicle for effective co-delivery of CUR and MTX in the treatment of cancer. "
"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the safety of opioids in the management of osteoarthritis (OA) in a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was undertaken in the MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Ovid CENTRAL), and Scopus electronic databases. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials that assessed adverse events (AEs) with opioids in patients with OA were eligible for inclusion. Two authors appraised titles, abstracts and full-text papers for suitability and then assessed the studies for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data and selective outcomes reporting. The primary outcomes of interest were gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, cardiac disorders, vascular disorders, nervous system disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, renal and urinary disorders, respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, as well as overall severe and serious AEs and drug-related AEs. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to AEs (i.e. the number of participants who stopped the treatment due to an AE) and total number of AEs (i.e. the number of patients who experienced any AE at least once). RESULTS: Database searches identified 2189 records, from which, after exclusions, 17 papers were included in the meta-analysis. More disorders of the lower GI tract (constipation, fecaloma) were reported with both immediate-release (IR) and extended-release (ER) formulations of opioids versus placebo: IR opioids (relative risk [RR] 5.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.42-7.89); ER opioids (RR 4.22, 95% CI 3.44-5.17). The risk of upper GI AEs increased fourfold with ER opioids compared with placebo (RR 4.03, 95% CI 0.87-18.62), and the risk of nausea, vomiting or loss of appetite increased four- to fivefold with both formulations: IR opioids (RR 3.39, 95% CI 2.22-5.18); ER opioids (RR 4.03, 95% CI 3.37-4.83). An increased risk of dermatologic AEs (rash and pruritis; IR opioids: RR 3.60, 95% CI 1.74-7.43; ER opioids: RR 7.87, 95% CI 5.20-11.89) and central nervous system disorders (dizziness, headache, fatigue, somnolence, insomnia; IR opioids: RR 2.76, 95% CI 1.90-4.02; ER opioids: RR 2.76, 95% CI 2.19-3.47) was found with all opioid formulations versus placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that there are considerable safety and tolerability issues surrounding the use of opioids in OA, and support the recommendation of international and national guidelines to use opioids in OA after other analgesic options, and for short time periods.

"BACKGROUND: Sunlight contains ultraviolet (UV)A and UVB radiation. UVB is essential for vitamin D synthesis but is the main cause of sunburn and skin cancer. Sunscreen use is advocated to reduce the sun's adverse effects but may compromise vitamin D status. OBJECTIVES: To assess the ability of two intervention sunscreens to inhibit vitamin D synthesis during a week-long sun holiday. METHODS: The impact of sunscreens on vitamin D status was studied during a 1-week sun holiday in Tenerife (28° N). Comparisons were made between two formulations, each with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15. The UVA-protection factor (PF) was low in one case and high in the other. Healthy Polish volunteers (n = 20 per group) were given the sunscreens and advised on the correct application. Comparisons were also made with discretionary sunscreen use (n = 22) and nonholiday groups (51·8° N, n = 17). Sunscreen use in the intervention groups was measured. Behaviour, UV radiation exposure, clothing cover and sunburn were monitored. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D RESULTS: Use of intervention sunscreens was the same (P = 0·60), and both equally inhibited sunburn, which was present in the discretionary use group. There was an increase (P < 0·001) in mean ± SD 25(OH)D CONCLUSIONS: Sunscreens may be used to prevent sunburn yet allow vitamin D synthesis. A high UVA-PF sunscreen enables significantly higher vitamin D synthesis than a low UVA-PF sunscreen because the former, by default, transmits more UVB than the latter. What's already known about this topic? Action spectra (wavelength dependence) for erythema and the cutaneous formation of vitamin D overlap considerably in the ultraviolet (UV)B region. Theoretically, sunscreens that inhibit erythema should also inhibit vitamin D synthesis. To date, studies on the inhibitory effects of sunscreens on vitamin D synthesis have given conflicting results, possibly, in part, because people typically apply sunscreen suboptimally. Many studies have design flaws. What does this study add? Sunscreens (sun protection factor, SPF 15) applied at sufficient thickness to inhibit sunburn during a week-long holiday with a very high UV index still allow a highly significant improvement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D "
"Abstract: Dendrobium officinale protocorms (DOPs) are a specific developmental stage of Dendrobium officinale KIMURA et MIGO, which is used in folk medicine to ease skin issues, such as wrinkles and erythema. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effect of DOPs on UV irradiation-induced skin damage in bc_nu hairless mice, using matrixyl as a positive control. Hairless mice were randomly separated into 6 groups (8 mice per group). The normal control group received solvent and was not exposed to UV irradiation, while the model control group received solvent and was exposed to UV irradiation. The positive control group was subjected to UV irradiation and then received a 10 mg/mL formulation of matrixyl. The DOPs-treated groups received a transdermal application of a DOPs formulation after 4 weeks of UV irradiation. Relevant indicators, such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), were then used to evaluate the ability of DOPs to repair photodamage. The results indicated that DOPs significantly reduced erythema and protected the skin from dryness and therefore exhibits a significant anti-photoaging effect. In addition, the expression of CAT, SOD, and GSH-Px increased while TBARS and MMPs levels decreased in DOPs-treated mice. This demonstrated that DOPs can inhibit photodamage in the skin of hairless mice. DOPs could be used as a potential therapeutic agent to protect the skin against UV-induced photoaging. "
"Abstract: Tazarotene is internationally accepted common name for ethyl 6-[(4,4-dimethylthiochroman-6-yl)ethynyl]nicotinate. It is a synthetic retinoid used for the topical treatment of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis, acne vulgaris and photo aging. To ensure the quality of drug product and drug substance, a LC-MS compatible UHPLC method was developed for quantification of drug and its related substances. Stationary phase with fused core particle technology is used for the separation of impurities. Limit of quantification and limit of detection of the method are 0.1 and 0.03%, respectively. Precision of the method for Tazarotene and all its related substances is less than 2.2% RSD. The correlation coefficient is >0.999. Accuracy of method is ranged from 95.3% to 107.0%. Application of this method in stability analysis has been demonstrated by analyzing stressed samples. Experimental design is used for the verification of robustness of the method. To ensure the safety, an in silico toxicity of the drug and its related substances were determined using TOPKAT and DEREK toxicity predictions Both UHPLC and in silico methods were validated as per the ICH Q2 and ICH M7 guidelines, which will enable a rapid product development of Tazarotene topical formulations while ensuring the safety and quality of product.

"Abstract: In this study, the hepatotoxicity, phototoxicity and photosensitizing potential of free dronedarone (DRO) and its inclusion complexes with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) and 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD), prepared by different methods, were investigated by using in vitro cell-based approaches. The results of the 3T3 NRU phototoxicity assay showed that free DRO and the CD-based inclusion complexes did not present any substantial phototoxic potential. The photosensitizing potential was assessed by using THP-1 cells and IL-8 as a biomarker, and the experimental data confirmed that both the free drug and the inclusion complexes are likely to cause skin photosensitization, as they were able to induce IL-8 release after irradiation. Nevertheless, the inclusion complexes obtained by kneading followed by spray-drying induced a lower IL-8 release and also presented a smaller stimulation index in comparison with free DRO, suggesting a reduction in the photosensitizing potential. Finally, the free drug and inclusion complexes were also tested for hepatotoxicity using HepG2 cells. Even though lower IC50 values were found for the inclusion complexes prepared by kneading followed by spray-drying, there was no significant difference, indicating that the complexation of dronedarone did not induce hepatotoxicity. Overall, the obtained data confirmed that the inclusion complexes prepared by kneading followed by spray-drying, especially those based on HP-β-CD, appeared to be the most promising formulations and, therefore, could be encouragingly explored in the development of novel pharmaceutical dosage forms containing DRO, presumably with reduced side effects and improved safety profile.

"Abstract: As obvious from the basic prerequisite of any particle in nanoscale, Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) possess numerous tunable properties distinct from their bulk formulations. Emerging innovations in various sectors of nanotechnology are exploiting ZnO NPs largely. This inturn picks up the occasions of human exposure irrespective of the application fields. Although the platform of nanotoxicology has been garnished with nano-bio interaction studies using different cell lines, a few are existing so far comprising primary cells which symbolize realistic in vivo environment. The present study addresses the neurotoxic potential of ZnO NPs using primary astrocytes isolated from post-natal 0-2 day old rat pups. Cells were cultured and maintained in DMEM F12 followed by purification. ZnO NPs generated by wet chemical method was then characterized both physico chemically and biologically. All of the techniques confirmed homogenous distribution of NPs and ensured enough colloidal stability. Bio-nano interaction studies commence on cell viability assays (MTT and NRU) and both of which confirmed dose and time dependent cytotoxicity. Alterations within cellular morphology, cytoskeletal arrangement, lysosomal stability, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and caspase activation were evaluated by standardized techniques. All of the assays substantiated significant toxic consequences in astrocytes with characteristic hall marks. Apoptotic cell death was noted without any deformations of nuclear material. A comparative toxicity study using ZnO NPs, ZnCl "

"BACKGROUND: 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) is one of the most commonly utilized drugs in psoralen-ultraviolet A therapy for treatment of vitiligo. However, poor skin retention and systemic side effects limit the clinical application of 8-MOP. METHODS: Microemulsions (MEs) and chitosan derivative-coated 8-MOP MEs were developed and compared for dermal delivery of 8-MOP. Ex vivo skin retention/permeation study was performed to select the ME formulation with the highest retention:permeation ratio. Four different chitosan-coated MEs were prepared and compared with the ME formulation for their ability to distribute 8-MOP in the skin. RESULTS: Among various ME formulations developed, a formulation containing 2.9% ethyl oleate, 17.2% Cromophor EL35, 8.6% ethanol and 71.3% water showed the highest ex vivo skin retention:permeation ratio (1.98). Of four chitosan-coated MEs prepared, carboxymethyl chitosan-coated MEs (CC-MEs) and hydroxypropyl chitosan-coated MEs (HC-MEs) showed higher ex vivo skin retention:permeation ratio (1.46 and 1.84). and were selected for in vivo pharmacokinetic study. AUC CONCLUSION: These combined results suggested that the MEs developed could be a promising and safe alternative for targeted skin delivery of 8-MOP. "
"Abstract: Introduction: This randomized, evaluator-blind, single-center, parallel-group study sought to evaluate the tolerability of two reformulated face washes containing benzoyl peroxide (BPO) in adults with mild to moderate acne vulgaris. Methods: Healthy adults with mild to moderate acne vulgaris were randomly allocated (1:1:1) to one of two reformulated test products (containing BPO at a concentration of either 4% or 10%) or an older formulation containing 10% BPO (reference product), which they applied twice daily for 21±2 days. The primary tolerability assessment was clinical assessment of signs and symptoms of cutaneous irritation by a dermatologist. The primary outcome was the total dermatologist assessment score (maximum total assessment score=12, indicating the most severe skin irritation). Secondary assessments were ophthalmologist assessments, subject self-assessments, and adverse events. Results: 133 adults were randomized and treated. The total dermatologist score changed by a mean of -0.08 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.192, 0.038) from baseline to day 21 in the 4% BPO cleanser group, by 0.05 (95% CI -0.021, 0.121) in the 10% BPO cleanser group, and by -0.02 (95% CI -0.105, 0.059) in the reference product group. There was no clinically significant difference between the reference product and the 4% BPO cleanser or 10% BPO cleanser in the mean change from baseline. Mean changes from baseline in ophthalmologist assessment scores and subject self-assessment scores for the 4% and 10% BPO test products were also comparable to those of the reference product. Dermal responses were consistent with the known effects of topical BPO application and no serious safety issues were reported. Discussion: There was no difference in the local tolerance profile of the reformulated BPO-containing face washes when compared with an older formulation.

"Abstract: The aim of this study was to incorporate methotrexate (MTX) into ultra-permeable niosomal vesicles, containing cremophor RH40 as an edge activator (EA) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a stabilizer to enhance the drug permeation. Formulae were prepared by ethanol injection method following a Box-Behnken design in order to optimize the formulation variables (EA%, stabilizer %, and sonication time). To investigate the role of both cremophor RH40 and PVA, conventional MTX niosomes and MTX niosomes containing PVA only were fabricated. Drug entrapment efficiency percent (EE%), particle size (PS) analysis, zeta potential (ZP) measurements, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were conducted to characterize the vesicles. Cell viability studies and ex vivo permeation experiments of the optimized formula were conducted. Lastly, in vivo skin deposition of MTX from both the optimized formula and MTX solution was performed in rats. Besides, histopathological changes in rat skin were assessed. The optimized MTX ultra-permeable niosomal formula demonstrated spherical morphology, with an EE% of 65.16% and a PS of 453.6 nm. The optimized formula showed better physical stability in comparison with that of the same composition but lacking PVA. The cell viability studies verified the superior cytotoxicity of the optimized formula, and the ex vivo permeation studies revealed its ability to improve the drug permeation. The optimized formula demonstrated a significant deposition of MTX in rat dorsal skin, and histopathological evaluation confirmed the tolerability of the optimized formula in rats upon topical application. Accordingly, ultra-permeable noisomes, as a stable nanosystem, could be promising for effective delivery of MTX. "
"PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of OTX-101, a novel aqueous nanomicellar formulation of cyclosporine (0.09%), in the treatment of patients with dry eye disease (DED). DESIGN: A randomized, multicenter, vehicle-controlled, double-masked, phase 3 clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Adults (18-90 years of age) with a history and clinical diagnosis of DED, a global symptom score of 40 or more (range, 0-100), and a lissamine green conjunctival staining score of 3 or more and 9 or less (range, 0-12) in at least 1 eye. METHODS: Eligible patients entered a run-in period of 14 to 20 days in which all patients administered vehicle twice daily. Patients who remained eligible at the baseline (day 0) visit were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to twice-daily treatment with OTX-101 0.09% or vehicle for 84 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Efficacy assessments included signs (unanesthetized Schirmer tear test, corneal and conjunctival staining) and symptoms (global symptom score) of DED. The primary end point was the proportion of eyes with a clinically meaningful improvement (increase of ≥10 mm) in Schirmer test score at day 84. Safety evaluations included adverse events (AEs), visual acuity, and intraocular pressure monitoring, slit-lamp, dilated ophthalmoscopy, and fundus examinations. RESULTS: A total of 744 patients were randomized and received study medication (371 to OTX-101 0.09% and 373 to vehicle). The primary end point was achieved; a significantly greater percentage of eyes in the OTX-101 0.09% treatment group achieved an increase of 10 mm or more in the Schirmer test score at day 84 (OTX-101 0.09%, 16.6%; vehicle, 9.2%; P < 0.001). Significant improvements relative to vehicle also were observed for corneal (days 28, 56, and 84) and conjunctival (days 56 and 84) staining. The global symptom score was reduced from baseline in both treatment groups by approximately 30%; however, no significant separation between groups was observed. The OTX-101 0.09% formulation was well tolerated. Treatment-emergent AEs were primarily mild in intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically and statistically significant improvements in tear production and ocular surface integrity were observed in patients treated with OTX-101 0.09% for DED. "
"Abstract: Many moisturisers contain sun protection factors (SPF) equivalent to those found in sunscreens. However, there is a lack of research into how SPF moisturiser application compares to sunscreens in terms of coverage achieved and protection afforded. Previously we demonstrated that users incompletely covered their eyelid regions during routine sunscreen application. Here, we aimed to determine if SPF moisturiser users also displayed these tendencies. A study population of 84 participants (22 males, 62 females, age 18-57) were exposed to UV radiation and photographed using a tripod mounted UV sensitive DSLR camera on two separate visits. At visit one, images were acquired before and after applying either SPF30 sunscreen or moisturiser, then at visit two the study was repeated with the other formulation. Images were processed for facial landmark identification followed by segmentation mapping of hue saturation values to identify areas of the face that were/were not covered. Analyses revealed that application of moisturiser was significantly worse than sunscreen in terms area of the whole face missed (11.1% missed with sunscreen compared to 16.6% for SPF moisturiser p<0.001 paired t-test). This difference was primarily due to decreased coverage of the eyelid regions (14.0% missed with sunscreen, 20.9% moisturiser, p<0.001). Analysis of a post-study questionnaire revealed participants to be unaware of their incomplete coverage. Secondary analyses revealed improved coverage in males (p = 0.05), and, with moisturiser only, in participants with darker skin tones (p = 0.02). Together these data indicate that, despite potential advantages in terms of increased frequency of application of moisturiser, the areas of the face that are at higher cancer risk are likely not being protected, and that participants are unaware that they are at risk. As such, alternative sun-protection strategies should be promoted. "
"OBJECTIVES: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, which evaluated a novel formulation of caraway oil and L-menthol using microsphere-based site-specific targeting (COLM-SST) vs placebo in patients with functional dyspepsia (FD). METHODS: Adult men and women with FD defined by Rome III criteria were recruited. Patients were randomized to COLM-SST (25 mg of caraway oil and 20.75 mg of L-menthol per capsule, at 2 capsules per dose, twice per day) or placebo. Efficacy was measured at 24 hours, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks. Patients were allowed to take concomitant medications for their FD throughout the trial, and rescue medicines were allowed, 48 hours after start of dosing. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients were enrolled (mean age = 43.4 years; 75.8% women). At 24 hours, the active arm reported a statistically significant reduction in postprandial distress syndrome symptoms (P = 0.039), and a nonsignificant trend toward benefit of epigastric pain syndrome symptoms (P = 0.074). In patients with more severe symptoms, approximately 3 quarters of patients showed substantial global improvement (i.e., clinical global impressions), after 4 weeks of treatment, vs half in the control arm. These differences were statistically significant for patients with epigastric pain syndrome (P = 0.046), and trending toward significance for patients with postprandial distress syndrome (P = 0.091). There was no statistically significant difference between groups for Global Overall Symptom scores for the overall population at 2 and 4 weeks. Treatment emergent adverse events were mild to moderate, and no serious adverse events were reported. DISCUSSION: In patients taking their usual medications for FD, COLM-SST provided rapid relief (within 24 hours) and relief of severe FD symptoms. It was safe and well tolerated. "
"Abstract: Cosmeceuticals are designed to serve a dual purpose: to provide desired esthetical effects and to treat dermatological conditions. Natural products derived from plants and marine organisms are a novel source of potential cosmeceutical active ingredients for incorporation into new formulations due to consumer demands. Contrary to common perceptions, most regulatory agencies do not view cosmeceuticals as being a separate category from cosmetics; thus, these products are not regulated accordingly, thereby forcing the consumer to rely on the self-regulatory policies of the cosmetics industry. Cosmeceuticals are advertised as having capabilities that include anti-aging, anti-acne, solar-protective, wound healing, and skin whitening. Such traits normally comprise several biological activities. In order to ensure the safety and efficacy of these products, active ingredients employed in the formulations must undergo a series of tests. In this review,  "
"Abstract: Many candidate anticancer drugs have suffered from their intrinsic hydrophobicity, which poses several obstacles for clinical application. To overcome this challenge and further improve the performance, herein a nanocrystal-based biomimetic formulation with a sandwich structure is developed. As the core, flake shaped nanocrystals (NCs) with high loading of the hydrophobic drug hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) are synthesized via a mild nanoprecipitation process by exploring the template effect of serum albumin. Meanwhile, the camouflaged cancer cell membrane (CM) composed of plentiful membrane proteins endows the NCs with homotypic targeting capacity at tumor sites. In addition, the photosensitizer indocyanine green sandwiched between NCs and CM not only converts near infrared light to heat for photothermal treatment but also improves the dissolution of HCPT NCs for chemotherapy. These features corporately achieve the orchestration of chemo-photothermal combination therapy and completely inhibit tumor growth with few adverse effects, showing promise as a new modality for the utilization of hydrophobic drugs to treat cancer.

"BACKGROUND: Melasma is an acquired hyperpigmentation, often involving the face, and a source of distress for the affected individuals. Although treatment is challenging and frequently a multimodality approach, topical applications are the mainstay of therapy. OBJECTIVE: Due to the frequent relapses, a therapy both acting rapidly and suitable for long-term use, with fewer adverse effects should be administered. In our outpatient clinic, we treated the melasma patients with a previously unreported triple combination which was empirically formulated with lesser amount of active components, regarding the balance between long-term use and safety. METHODS: Sixty-eight female patients with melasma who referred to our hospital dermatology clinic in the years 2016-2017 were retrospectively recruited. They all had completed 6-month treatment with a prescribed cream mixture comprised of azelaic acid (4%), hydroquinone (1.6%), methylprednisolone aceponate (0.04%), and salicylic acid (2%). The outcomes were evaluated both instrumentally (Melanin Index/MI) and by patients (Patient Self-Assessment Scale/PSAS). RESULTS: Adverse effects declared by the patients were transient irritation in three and mild hypertrichosis in two. Both the MI and PSAS values were found extremely significant at the end of 6th month, compared with initial values. Approximately 62% of total decrease in MI was realized in the first 3 months. CONCLUSION: The triple combination containing active ingredients with lesser concentrations than proposed, and with the addition of 2% salicylic acid, may be promising as a quite effective and safe protocol in treatment of melasma for longer durations.

"Abstract: The incorporation of chemo/photothermal/photodynamic therapy in subcellular organelles such as mitochondria has attracted extensive attention recently. Here, we designed mitochondria-targeted hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (THMSNs) loaded biocompatible phase-change material L-menthol (LM) via a facile method. Meanwhile, antitumor drug doxorubicin (DOX) and near-infrared (NIR) dye indocyanine green (ICG) approved by FDA were simultaneously encapsulated into THMSNs, denoted as THMSNs@LMDI, which showed NIR radiation triggered capacity for cancer treatment. With the mitochondria-targeted ability of triphenylphosphine, the resulting THMSNs@LMDI showed evidently improved cellular internalization and specific accumulation in mitochondria. Under NIR irradiation, the versatile ICG would be bound to simultaneously produce photodynamic and photothermal therapy. Meanwhile, in view of the solid-liquid phase transition feature of gatekeeper LM, THMSNs@LMDI provided a platform for NIR-mediated temperature-responsive DOX release. As a matter of course, these smart subcellular organelle-THMSNs could serve as an effective drug delivery platform for site-specific on-demand chemo/photothermal/photodynamic therapy of cancer. "
"Abstract: Low dose Methotrexate (MTX) therapy is considered a gold standard for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Transdermal drug delivery is hypothesized as an alternative to conventional therapies to alleviate its adverse effects. In our study, MTX was entrapped in deformable liposomes and loaded in a hydroxyethyl cellulose gel. This system was evaluated by the Box Behnken statistical design for optimization. The effect of formulation variables on particle size, entrapment and ex vivo skin permeation was studied. The MTX nanogel was evaluated for its dermal toxicity (acute and repeat dose safety), in vivo biodistribution (using  "
"Abstract: Adapalene (ADAP) is an important drug widely used in the topical treatment of acne. It is a third-generation retinoid and provides keratolytic, anti-inflammatory, and antiseborrhoic action. However, some topical adverse effects such as erythema, dryness, and scaling have been reported with its commercial formula. In this sense, the microencapsulation of this drug using polyesters can circumvent its topical side effects and can lead to the enhancement of drug delivery into sebaceous glands. The goal of this work was to obtain ADAP-loaded poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) microparticles prepared by a simple emulsion/solvent evaporation method. Formulations containing 10 and 20% of ADAP were successfully obtained and characterized by morphological, spectroscopic, and thermal studies. Microparticles presented encapsulation efficiency of ADAP above 98% and showed a smooth surface and spherical shape. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results presented no drug-polymer chemical bond, and a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique showed a partial amorphization of the drug. ADAP permeation in the Strat-M membrane for transdermal diffusion testing was evaluated by photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) in the spectral region between 225 and 400 nm after 15 min and 3 h from the application of ADAP-loaded PCL formulations. PAS was successfully used for investigating the penetration of polymeric microparticles. In addition, microencapsulation decreased the in vitro transmembrane diffusion of ADAP. "
"Abstract: Over the last years nanoparticles (NP) have become a promising vehicle as drug delivery systems for photodynamic therapy (PDT), combining the advantages of an effective drug transport to the target cells and the reduction of undesired side effects. The in vitro evaluation of new nanoparticulate formulations has become a rising problem since cell culture models differ from the in vivo situation of the human body to a large extent. Particularly, in case of gastrointestinal tumors, after peroral application nanoparticles are challenged by overcoming the mucus layer as a first physical barrier before reaching the target cells, an aspect often neglected in literature. However, the presence of mucus is crucial for in vitro models to evaluate mucus-penetrating potential of surface-modified nanoparticulate drug carrier systems. Biodegradable poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) NP loaded with the model photosensitizer 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(m-hydroxyphenyl)porphyrin (mTHPP) were surface modified with either poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) or chitosan (CS) to gain mucus-penetrating or mucoadhesive particle properties. All NP systems were compared to each other and to free mTHPP regarding cytotoxicity and cellular uptake in HT-29 cells and mucus producing HT-29-MTX cells. For PEGylated mTHPP-PLGA-PEG-NP a significantly higher accumulation was obtained in HT-29-MTX cells compared to all other tested nanoparticles and the free drug. Additionally, a mucus-containing Transwell® model, consisting of HT-29-MTX cells, confirmed these results, representing a promising in vitro screening method for mucus-penetrating particle properties.

"Abstract: Kalanchoe brasiliensis and Kalanchoe pinnata are used interchangeably in traditional medicine in the treatment of wound healing. In this context, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the local anti-inflammatory activity of a topical formulation containing aqueous extract of both species. The in vivo model used was ear edema induced by croton oil and paw edema induced by carrageenan. The Swiss mice treatments use formulations containing aqueous extract at different concentrations (1.25%, 2.5%, and 5%) or dexamethasone (1 mg/g), all administered topically and immediately after edema induction. The treatment with formulations containing aqueous extract of both species reduced ear and paw edema, besides that, the decrease in edema was evidenced by reduction of myeloperoxidase activity, IL-1β, and TNF-α levels and increase IL-10 levels. In conclusion, the two species showed local anti-inflammatory activity; however K. brasiliensis showed a better result in both edematogenic models since it had activity in the lowest concentration.

"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Incidence of melanoma is increasing globally. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) as important risk factor for developing skin cancer can be influenced by tanning behavior. Only a few studies are available concerning sun tanning behavior and protective measures. METHODS: An online survey was distributed via social media to assess tanning habits and examine associated demographic and behavioral factors. RESULTS: In total, 403 questionnaires were distributed, and mean age of respondents was 32. Having a tanned skin, feeling warm and relaxed were the most common motivations for tanning. The use of sunscreen varied and seemed to depend on the occasion of UVR exposure, constantly applied during vacation and during tanning, less commonly applied in daily life and during work. Avoiding painful solar dermatitis was more important as motivation for the use of sunscreen than skin cancer prevention. Skin aging as reason for the use of sunscreen was especially important for females younger than 26 years. The most common applied sun protection factor was 16-49. The main reason opposing the use of sunscreen was a too laborious usage, which was significantly associated with male. Beauty was the only association related to tanned skin the majority (62%) agreed with. CONCLUSION: The motivation for tanning and reasons for avoiding sunscreen strongly varies. Knowledge about these factors could be used for improving campaigns with respect to target groups. Clarifying the appropriate application of sunscreen, developing convenient sunscreen formulations and providing information about UVR-induced skin aging could lead to an increased usage of sunscreen and therefore to an improved UVR protection.

"Abstract: Antibiotics and photodynamic therapy (PDT) are widely employed in curing acne. However, antibiotics as an effective treatment would lead to bacterial resistance and severe side effects. In this study, we aimed to develop a novel TBO hydrogel, which could prolong the retention time of photosensitizer (TBO) at the lesion site and improve therapeutic effect. In vitro antibacterial experiments (against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli), the response surface methodology was used to optimize the formulation of TBO hydrogel. The results indicated that the optimal formulation was 0.5% (v/v) carbomer, 0.01 mg/mL TBO, 0.5% (v/v) ethanol concentration, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 80, the mass ratio of NaOH to carbomer of 0.4 (w/w). The TBO hydrogel formulation showed the strong antibacterial activity for Propionibacterium acnes. The stability, pH, and antibacterial activity of TBO hydrogel did not significantly change under 4 °C, 25 °C, and 40 °C during 6-week storage. Furthermore, TBO combined with carbomer hydrogel showed the 51.28% (4 h) and 69.80% (24 h) release. In summary, the hydrogel TBO might be a vital therapeutic strategy to promote the PDT applied in the topical therapy of acne.

"Abstract: Vitamin C (L-Ascorbic acid) has many favourable effects on the skin such as antioxidant, anti-aging and whitening effects. Its instability and low permeability limit its pharmaceutical use in cosmetic and dermatological products. Instead, Mg ascorbyl phosphate (MAP), an ascorbic acid derivative, has the same effect with higher stability is being used. In this work, a vesicular system, aspasomes, containing MAP was developed and evaluated. Aspasomes are multilayered vesicles formed by amphiphiles molecules, Ascorbyl palmitate (ASP), in combination with cholesterol and charged lipids for drug encapsulation. Here, we investigated the use of lecithin instead of the charged lipid dicetyl phosphate for aspasomes development. Nine formulations were prepared and evaluated for their entrapment efficiency, particle size, polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential. Their entrapment efficiency ranged from 33.00 ± 2.27 to 95.18 ± 1.06, while their particle size was from 373.34 ± 60.85 to 464.37 ± 93.46 nm with acceptable PDI (from 0.212 ± 0.068 to 0.351 ± 0.061) and zeta potential (from -37.52 ± 2.42 to -50.36 ± 1.82). Three formulations were selected and evaluated for their drug release, permeation and retention into skin. One formulation was selected to be formulated as aspasomal topical cream and gel. The aspasomal cream was found to have enhanced drug permeation and skin retention over the aspasomal gel as well as the aspasomes formulation. MAP aspasomal cream was evaluated clinically as an effective treatment for melasma against 15% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and the results recorded that the aspasomal cream showed the greatest degree of improvement regarding the hemi-MASI scores with 35% of patients rating it as excellent treatment. The study showed that MAP aspasomal cream can be considered a novel treatment of melasma which is free of side effects. Its efficacy as a monotherapy is superior to that of chemical peeling using 15% TCA. "
"Abstract: Topical delivery of therapeutic agents for skin diseases is a major advantage in dermatology. However, the efficacy and tolerability of topically applied therapies is dependent on several characteristics, including percutaneous penetration and permeation of active ingredient and lack of side effects, especially local tolerability reactions. Importantly, the ultimate performance of a topical product includes collectively the effects of the active ingredient and the impact that specific additives have on vehicle characteristics, such as penetration, permeation, epidermal barrier properties, relative irritancy, allergenicity potential, and patient acceptance/preference of the vehicle formulation used. Foam vehicles have evolved over time with the emergence of a menu of alcohol-based and aqueous-based variations that provide various advantages depending on clinical circumstances and the disease being treated. Aqueous-based foams have gained widespread acceptance and preference, especially due to favorable skin tolerability and the cosmetic elegance of the products. In this manuscript, data are presented supporting the efficacy, tolerability, and safety, of specific aqueous-based foam vehicles for calcipotriene used to treat plaque psoriasis, and for tazarotene used to treat acne vulgaris. Discussions include both vehicle-based properties that are relevant to clinical practice, and outcomes from the large-scale pivotal clinical trials that review efficacy and safety results and patient reported outcomes. The latter also discusses several practical subject assessments about use of the foam vehicle. J Drugs Dermatol. 2019;18(2 Suppl):s100-107. "
"Abstract: Background: Acne vulgaris (acne) is a common dermatological condition typically associated with adolescents, affecting about 85% of young people. However, it is also prevalent and persistent into adulthood, particularly in females. The efficacy of tretinoin in acne is well documented with large pivotal studies. The first lotion formulation of tretinoin was developed to provide an important alternative option to treat acne patients who may be sensitive to the irritant effects of other tretinoin formulations. Objective: To determine whether efficacy and safety of tretinoin 0.05% lotion was similar in adolescent (<18 years) and adult (>=18 years) women with moderate-to-severe acne. Methods: Post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 studies in moderate or severe acne. Female subjects (aged 9 to 58 years, N=909) randomized (1:1) to receive tretinoin 0.05% lotion or vehicle, once-daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy assessments included changes in baseline inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions and treatment success (at least 2-grade reduction in Evaluator’s Global Severity Score [EGSS] and clear/almost clear). Safety, adverse events (AEs), and cutaneous tolerability were evaluated throughout. Results: At week 12, mean percent reduction in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts in female subjects were 56.9% and 51.7%, respectively, compared with 47.1% and 34.9% with vehicle (P=<0.001). Similar results were seen in adult and adolescent females in terms of reduction in inflammatory lesion counts with tretinoin 0.05% lotion; reduction in noninflammatory lesions was significantly greater in adult females (P=0.002). Treatment success was achieved by 23.6% of female subjects by week 12, compared with 13.5% on vehicle (P<0.001). Although treatment success was somewhat greater in adult females (24.6% versus 21.6%), the difference was not significant. The majority of AEs were mild and transient. There were five serious AEs (SAEs) reported (4/1, adult/adolescent, respectively). The most frequently reported treatment related AEs with tretinoin 0.05% lotion were application site pain (3.0%/5.7%), and application site dryness (4.9%/6.4%). Local cutaneous safety and tolerability assessments were generally mild-to-moderate and improved by week 12. Slight increases in mean scores were observed for scaling, burning and stinging within the first four weeks and appeared to be transient. Conclusions: Tretinoin 0.05% lotion was significantly more effective than its vehicle in achieving treatment success and reducing inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions in female acne. Noninflammatory lesion count reduction was significantly greater in adult females compared with adolescent females. The new lotion formulation was well-tolerated.

"Abstract: Accidental exposure to lethal doses of Gamma radiation leads to the systemic inflammatory syndrome which causes mortality. In view of this, management of hemopoietic syndrome by modulating pro-inflammatory response in clinically manageable time period seems to be the most appropriate strategy for encountering radiation induced damage and recovery. As both tissue and peripheral macrophages are critical for the management of radiation induced injuries, we have unraveled the immunomodulatory potential of radioprotective formulation (G-003M) on peripheral macrophages populations in this study. G-003M inhibited lethal radiation induced NO and Th1 effector cytokines in the exposed macrophages indicating its M1 dim polarizing capacity. In similar lines, conditioning of mice with G-003M before lethal irradiation (LR) inhibited LR induced titre of Th1 effector cytokines in both serums as well as in lung, small intestine, and spleen tissue confirming its immunomodulatory potential. G-003M potentially down modulated inflammatory response in LPS induced inflammatory model and enhanced M2 polarization of iNOS+ M1 effector macrophages providing a molecular hint on G-003M mechanism of action on macrophages. These observations revealed that G-003M potentially modulate pro-inflammatory programming of macrophages and mitigate radiation-induced inflammatory stress which is believed to contribute significantly to radioprotective attribute of G-003M. In this study, we demonstrate that Rutin and Podophyllotoxin drive M1 "
"INTRODUCTION: Catheter-related sepsis is one of the most dangerous complications of neonatal intensive care and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Use of catheter-care 'bundles' has reduced the incidence of catheter-related sepsis, although individual components have not been well studied. Better evidence is needed to guide selection of the most appropriate antiseptic solution for skin disinfection in preterm neonates. This study will inform the feasibility and design of the first randomised controlled trial to examine the safety and efficacy of alcohol-based versus aqueous-based chlorhexidine antiseptic formulations for skin disinfection prior to percutaneous central venous catheterisation in preterm neonates. The antiseptics to be compared are 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) aqueous and 2% CHG in 70% isopropyl alcohol. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Antiseptic Randomised Controlled Trial for Insertion of Catheters (ARCTIC) is a two-centre randomised-controlled feasibility trial. At least 100 preterm infants born at <34 weeks' gestation and due to undergo percutaneous insertion of a central venous catheter will be randomly allocated to receive prior skin disinfection with one of the two antiseptic solutions. Outcomes include: i) recruitment and retention rates; ii) completeness of data collection; iii) numbers of enrolled infants meeting case definitions for definite catheter-related sepsis, catheter-associated sepsis and catheter colonisation and iv) safety outcomes of skin morbidity scores recorded daily from catheter insertion until 48 hours post removal. The key feasibility metrics will be reported as proportions with 95% CIs. Estimated prevalence of catheter colonisation will allow calculation of sample size for the large-scale trial. The data will inform whether it will be feasible to progress to a large-scale trial. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: ARCTIC has been approved by the National Health Service Health Research Authority National Research Ethics Service Committee East of England (Cambridge South) (IRAS ID 163868), was adopted onto the National Institute of Health Research Clinical Research Network portfolio (CPMS ID 19899) and is registered with an International Standard Randomised Control Trials Number (ISRCTN: 82571474; Pre-results) and European Clinical Trials Database number 2015-000874-36. Dissemination plans include presentations at scientific conferences, scientific publications and sharing of the findings with parents via the support of Bliss baby charity.

"BACKGROUND:: Xerosis (dryness) of the foot is commonly encountered in clinical care and can lead to discomfort, pain, and predisposition to infection. Many moisturizing products are available, with little definitive research to recommend any particular formulation. METHODS:: We compared two commonly prescribed moisturizing products from different ends of the price spectrum (sorbolene and 25% urea cream) for their effectiveness in reducing xerosis signs using the Specified Symptom Sum Score. A randomized clinical trial of parallel design was conducted over 28 days (February-May 2015) on 41 participants with simple xerosis. Participants, therapists, assessors, and data entry personnel were blinded to treatment, and allocation was determined via a randomization table. RESULTS:: Thirty-four participants completed the study (19 urea and 15 sorbolene), with one reporting minor adverse effects. There were statistically significant improvements in both groups after 28 days. Mean differences between pre and post scores were 3.50 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.80 to 4.20) for the urea group and 2.90 (95% CI, 2.00 to 3.80) for the sorbolene group. There was a slightly lower mean posttreatment score in the urea group (1.16; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.64) than in the sorbolene group (1.80; 95% CI, 1.25 to 2.35), but this difference was not significant ( P ≤ .09). Effect size of difference was -0.48 (95% CI, -1.16 to 0.22). CONCLUSIONS:: In this study, there was no difference between using sorbolene or 25% urea cream to treat symptoms of foot xerosis. A recommendation, therefore, cannot be made based on efficacy alone; however, sorbolene treatments are invariably cheaper than urea-based ones. "

"Abstract: Hormone replacement therapy has been shown to be effective in alleviating menopausal symptoms. However, its use is controversial owing to potential health risks, such as thromboembolism and cancer. Bioidentical hormone therapy has recently become popular as an alternative to conventional hormone replacement therapy. These bioidentical hormones have a molecular structure identical to endogenous hormones found in a woman's body. A claimed advantage of bioidentical hormone therapy is the compounding practice in order to individualize therapy depending on patient's own hormone levels and symptoms. However, there is no scientific evidence to assess the validity of these claims. Bioidentical hormone therapy has also been used by dermatologists for its anti-aging effects on the skin, but little is known about efficacy and side effects of bioidentical hormones in this field. This review illustrates the main purpose of bioidentical hormone therapy for dermatological uses and its potential side effects, serving as a tool for dermatologists when facing these patients. "
"PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of waterfree cyclosporine formulation (CyclASol) at 2 concentrations (0.1% and 0.05% of cyclosporine [CsA]) to vehicle when applied twice daily for 16 weeks in patients with dry eye disease (DED). An open-label Restasis (Allergan, Irvine, CA) arm was included to allow a direct comparison with an approved therapy. DESIGN: An exploratory phase II, multicenter, randomized, vehicle-controlled clinical trial, double-masked between CyclASol and vehicle with an open-label comparator. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and seven eligible patients with a history of dry eye disease were randomized 1:1:1:1 to 1 of 4 treatment arms (CyclASol 0.05%, n = 51; CyclASol 0.1%, n = 51; vehicle, n = 52, and Restasis, n = 53). METHODS: After a 2-week run-in period with twice-daily dosing of Systane Balance (Alcon, Fort Worth, TX), patients were randomized to the respective treatment arm and dosed twice daily for 16 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The study was set up to explore efficacy on a number of sign and symptom end points including total and subregion corneal fluorescein staining, conjunctival staining, visual analog scale (VAS) for dry eye symptoms VAS severity, and Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire. RESULTS: CyclASol showed a consistent reduction in corneal and conjunctival staining compared with both vehicle and Restasis over the 16-week treatment period, with an early onset of effect (at day 14). A mixed-effects model-based approach demonstrated that the CyclASol drug effect was statistically significant over vehicle (total corneal staining P < 0.1, central corneal staining P < 0.001, conjunctival staining P < 0.01). This model-based analysis suggests a significant CyclASol effect for OSDI as symptom parameter (P < 0.01). The numbers of ocular adverse events were low in all treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: CyclASol showed efficacy, safety, and tolerability at 2 concentrations in moderate-to-severe DED. In a direct head-to-head against open-label Restasis, CyclASol was found to have an earlier onset of action, as early as after 2 weeks of treatment, in relieving the signs of DED, as measured by corneal and conjunctival staining. The central region of the cornea, an important area for visual function in dry eye sufferers, was shown to have the most benefit from treatment. Excellent safety, tolerability, and comfort profile supports this new CsA formulation as having a positive benefit-to-risk ratio. "
"Abstract: Background: Acne vulgaris (acne) is the most common dermatologic disease seen in a racially, geographically, politically, culturally, and socioeconomically diverse Hispanic population. Despite their growing demographics in the US, there are few studies evaluating acne treatment in this population. Potential for skin irritation and dryness, as well as pigmentary changes are key concerns. The first lotion formulation of tretinoin was developed using novel polymerized emulsion technology to provide an important alternative option to treat these acne patients who may be sensitive to the irritant effects of other tretinoin formulations. Objective: To determine the efficacy and safety of tretinoin 0.05% lotion in treating moderate-to-severe acne in a Hispanic population. Methods: Post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 studies in moderate or severe acne. Hispanic subjects (aged 11 to 50 years, N=766) were randomized (1:1) to receive tretinoin 0.05% lotion or vehicle, once-daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy assessments included changes in baseline inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions and treatment success (at least 2-grade reduction in Evaluator’s Global Severity Score [EGSS] and clear/almost clear). Safety, adverse events (AEs), and cutaneous tolerability were evaluated throughout using a 4-point scale where 0=none and 3=severe. Results: At week 12, mean percent reduction in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts were 60.1% and 53.0%, respectively, compared with 51.1% and 38.7% with vehicle (P≤0.001) in the Hispanic population. Treatment success was achieved by 19.6% of subjects by week 12, compared with 12.7% on vehicle (P=0.015). The majority of AEs were mild and transient. There were four serious AEs (SAEs) reported (two each group) unrelated to treatment. Incidence of treatment-related AEs with tretinoin 0.05% lotion was lower than in the overall study population; the most frequently were application site pain (2.0%), dryness (1.4%), and erythema (1.2%). Local cutaneous safety and tolerability assessments were generally mild-to-moderate at baseline and improved by week 12. There were slight transient increases in scaling and burning over the first four weeks. Hyperpigmentation severity reduced progressively with treatment. Conclusions: Tretinoin 0.05% lotion was significantly more effective than its vehicle in achieving treatment success and reducing inflammatory and noninflammatory acne lesions in a Hispanic population. The new lotion formulation was well-tolerated, and all treatment-related AEs were both mild and transient in nature. J Drugs Dermatol. 2019;18(1):32-38. "
"BACKGROUND: The novel intranasal formulation of azelastine hydrochloride (AZE) and fluticasone propionate (FP) in a single spray (MP-AzeFlu) was compared with a first-line intranasal antihistamine spray (AZE) in Russian seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) patients. METHODS: Moderate-to-severe SAR/rhinoconjunctivitis patients (n = 149; aged 18-65 years) were randomized to receive MP-AzeFlu (137/50 μg AZE/FP per spray) or AZE (137 μg/spray), both as 1 spray/nostril twice daily, in a multicenter, open-label, 14-day, parallel-group trial. The primary outcome was change from baseline in morning and evening reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS). Secondary end points included: change from baseline in reflective total ocular symptom score (rTOSS), reflective total of 7 symptom scores (rT7SS), 28-item Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) overall score, and EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire score. RESULTS: When compared with AZE-treated patients, those treated with MP-AzeFlu experienced significantly greater reductions in rTNSS (difference: -2.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.65 to -1.30; p < 0.001), rTOSS (difference: -1.62; 95% CI -2.32 to -0.92; p < 0.001), and rT7SS (difference: -4.34; 95% CI -5.98 to -2.70; p < 0.001). Superior relief observed on day 2 with MP-AzeFlu versus AZE was sustained throughout the study. MP-AzeFlu-treated patients experienced a greater improvement in QoL than AZE-treated patients as measured by overall RQLQ score (mean ± SD 2.91 ± 1.08 vs. 2.05 ± 1.15) and EQ-5D score (mean ± SD 87.4 ± 10.3 vs. 83.0 ± 12.8). MP-AzeFlu was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: MP-AzeFlu was superior to AZE in reducing moderate-to-severe SAR symptoms, providing earlier and more complete symptom relief. "
"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is one of the most lethal cancers and lacks effective treatment strategy. Therapeutic efficacy can be improved through active targeting approach utilizing surface engineered nanoparticles (NPs) for cancer therapy. PURPOSE: The present study envisioned development of Folic acid (FA) functionalized NPs for co-administration of gefitinib (Gnb) and capsaicin (Cap) respectively to enhance the therapeutic outcome by disabling the barriers related to tumors extracellular matrix. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURE: The FA conjugated Gnb/Cap polymeric (PLGA-PEG) NPs were prepared using oil in water emulsion technique and methodically developed using Quality by Design (QbD) concept employing central composite design. The developed formulations were subjected to various in vitro (A549 cell lines) and in vivo evaluations in urethane-induced lung cancer. RESULTS: The modified NPs displayed particle sizes of 217.0 ± 3.2 nm and 213.0 ± 5.2 nm and drug release of 85.65 ± 3.21% and 81.43 ± 4.32% for Gnb and Cap respectively. Higher cellular uptake and lower cell viability in A549 cell line was displayed by functionalized NPs compared to free drug. Co administration of Gnb and Cap NPs displayed significant targeting potential, reduction in tumor volume while restoring the biochemical parameters viz., SOD, catalase, TBARS and protein carbonyl, towards normal levels when compared with toxic group. Significant down regulation was observed for anti-apoptotic proteins (MMP-9) and up regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (caspase-3, caspase-9 and MMP-9) with co-therapy of Gnb and Cap NPs, when compared with individual therapy through Gnb/Cap. CONCLUSION: Potentiation of the action of Gnb when co administered with Cap NPs can be a promising breakthrough for developing safe, effective and targeted delivery for lung carcinoma therapy. "
"BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris (acne) is a common skin condition in children and adolescents. Efficacy of tretinoin is well documented in studies that included pediatric patients (12-18 years of age). With acne routinely presenting in younger patients, data are needed in this important group. Lotion formulations are commonly used across dermatology and are well liked by patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel once-daily tretinoin 0.05% lotion in preadolescent subjects (≤ 13 years) with moderate-to-severe acne. METHODS: Post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 3 studies in moderate-to-severe acne. Preadolescent subjects (N = 154) randomized (1:1) to receive tretinoin 0.05% lotion or vehicle, once daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy assessments included changes in baseline inflammatory/noninflammatory lesions and treatment success (at least 2-grade reduction in Evaluator's Global Severity Score [EGSS] and clear/almost clear). Safety, adverse events (AEs), and cutaneous tolerability evaluated throughout. RESULTS: At Week 12, mean percent reduction in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts were 49.5% and 44.0% compared with 31.4% and 18.8% with vehicle (both P = 0.001). Treatment success was achieved by 23.7% of subjects by Week 12, compared with 7.2% (P = 0.009). The majority of AEs were mild and transient: most frequently were application site pain (5.6%) and application site dryness (2.8%). Local cutaneous safety and tolerability assessments were generally mild-to-moderate and improved by Week 12. CONCLUSIONS: Tretinoin 0.05% lotion was significantly more effective than vehicle in achieving treatment success and reducing inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions in preadolescent acne. It was well tolerated, with all treatment-related AEs deemed mild or moderate. "
"Abstract: Babchi essential oil (BEO) is a valuable essential oil reported to possess a variety of biological activities such as antitumor, anti inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, antifungal and antibacterial properties. Due to its anti-microbial properties, this oil possesses an immense potential for the treatment of dermatological disorders. Further, it has minimal tendency to develop resistance, a common issue with most of the antibiotics. However, its highly viscous nature and poor stability in the presence of light, air and high temperature, limits its practical applications. To surmount these issues, this research aims to encapsulate BEO in ethyl cellulose (EC) microsponges for enhanced stability, antibacterial effect and decreased dermal toxicity. The quasi emulsion solvent evaporation technique was used for fabrication of the BEO microsponges employing EC as polymer, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as stabilizer and dichloro methane (DCM) as solvent. The effect of formulation variables such as the amount of EC and PVA were also investigated. The prepared microformulations were evaluated for production yield, encapsulation efficiency, particle size and in vitro release. In vitro cytotoxicity was also checked to assess dermal safety of BEO microsponges. Results revealed that all the dispersions were in micro size range (20.44 ± 3.13 μm to 41.75 ± 3.65 μm), with good encapsulation efficiency (87.70 ± 1.20% of F2) and controlled release profile (cumulative drug release 73.34 ± 1.76%). Field emission scanning electron microscopy results showed that the microsponges possessed a spherical uniform shape with a spongy structure. Results of cytotoxicity study indicated that the prepared microsponges were safer on dermal cells in comparison to pure BEO. The optimized formulation was also evaluated for in vitro antimicrobial assay against dermal bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, which confirmed their enhanced antibacterial activity. Furthermore, the results of photostability and stability analysis indicated improved stability of BEO loaded microsponges. Hence, encapsulation of BEO in microsponges resulted in efficacious carrier system in terms of stability as well as safety of this essential oil alongwith handling benefits. "
"Abstract: The safety and stability of synthetic UV-filters and the procedures for evaluating the photoprotective capability of commercial sunscreens are under continuous review. The influence of pH and temperature stressors on the stability of certain Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) isolated at high purity levels was examined. MAAs were highly stable at room temperature during 24 h at pH 4.5⁻8.5. At 50 °C, MAAs showed instability at pH 10.5 while at 85 °C, progressive disappearances were observed for MAAs through the studied pH range. In alkaline conditions, their degradation was much faster. Mycosporine-serinol and porphyra-334 (+shinorine) were the most stable MAAs under the conditions tested. They were included in four cosmetically stable topical sunscreens, of which the Sun Protection Factor (SPF) and other Biological Effective Protection Factors (BEPFs) were calculated. The formulation containing these MAAs showed similar SPF and UVB-BEPFs values as those of the reference sunscreen, composed of synthetic UV absorbing filters in similar percentages, while UVA-BEPFs values were slightly lower. Current in vitro data strongly suggest that MAAs, as natural and safe UV-absorbing and antioxidant compounds, have high potential for protection against the diverse harmful effects of solar UV radiation. In addition, novel complementary in vitro tests for evaluation of commercial sunscreens efficacy are proposed. "
"BACKGROUND: Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)-induced contact dermatitis is a commonly used model for testing the effects of different topical formulations. According to the guidelines, the volar forearms are the preferred testing site; however, other anatomical locations have been used in previous research, particularly the upper back as the clinically used site for testing different antigens. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the existence of anatomical variations of the skin response to irritation and its effects on the response to treatment. METHODS: Irritation was induced with SLS on symmetrical sites on both forearms and sides of the upper back with additional sites exposed to water as controls. Half of the sites were treated with emollient cream while the other half were left untreated. Irritation was assessed using bioengineering methods and clinical scoring. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT03231813. RESULTS: Upper back skin showed higher reactivity to irritants with stronger barrier disruption (measured by Tewameter CONCLUSIONS: The skin's reaction to irritant and recovery was dependent on anatomical location. The location where testing was conducted should always be reported, as treatments tested across different locations could not be directly compared with each other. "
"Abstract: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that imposes a substantial economic burden. We conducted a cost-utility analysis from a Swedish healthcare payers perspective using a decision-tree model with a 12-week time horizon. Patients with psoriasis vulgaris could have two 4-week cycles of topical treatment with calcipotriol 50 µg/g and betamethasone 0.5 mg/g as dipropionate (Cal/BD) foam or Cal/BD ointment before progressing to phototherapy/methotrexate. In the base-case analysis, Cal/BD foam dominated over Cal/BD ointment. The increased efficacy of Cal/BD foam resulted in fewer consultations and a decreased risk of progressing to phototherapy/methotrexate. Although Cal/BD foam costs more than Cal/BD ointment, this was offset by lower costs for phototherapy/methotrexate or consultation visits. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the base-case net monetary benefit was robust to plausible variations in key parameters. In conclusion, Cal/BD foam was predicted to be more cost-effective than Cal/BD ointment in the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris. "

"BACKGROUND: There is a significant need for novel, safe, and efficacious topical treatments for psoriasis. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the safety and efficacy of tapinarof in a new cream formulation at 2 concentrations and with 2 application frequencies in adults with psoriasis. METHODS: Double-blind, vehicle-controlled, randomized, 6-arm trial (1:1:1:1:1:1) in adults, with psoriasis with body surface involvement ≥1% and ≤15% and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) score ≥2 at baseline. Primary endpoint included PGA of 0 or 1 at week 12 and a 2-grade improvement from baseline. Additional analyses included assessment of ≥75% improvement of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index and mean percent change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index and body surface area involvement. RESULTS: Treatment success defined by PGA 0 or 1 and a 2-grade improvement at week 12 was statistically significantly higher (at a .05 significance level) in the tapinarof groups (65% [1% twice daily], 56% [1% once daily], 46% [0.5% twice daily], and 36% [0.5% once daily]) than in the vehicle groups (11% [twice daily] and 5% [once daily]) and was maintained for 4 weeks posttreatment. Treatment-emergent adverse events were more frequent in patients treated with tapinarof (85/152, 56%) than vehicle (19/75, 25%) and mild-to-moderate in intensity. Severe treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in all tapinarof groups except the 0.5% once daily group. LIMITATIONS: Large confirmation trials are needed. CONCLUSIONS: Tapinarof cream is efficacious and well tolerated in adult patients with psoriasis. "
"Abstract: Cosmetic oils are used to dissolve crystalline lipophilic UV filters; however, little knowledge exists about the effect of other formulation ingredients. This study investigates the influence of emulsifiers on the recrystallization speed of 4 UV filters and the impact of UV-filter crystal formation on delivered performance. The crystallization pattern of studied UV filters was assessed using X-ray diffractometry, whereas their recrystallization speed in formulations with various emulsifiers was monitored microscopically. UV-filter concentration was above the saturation level to promote recrystallization. Furthermore, to understand the kinetics of recrystallization, the conformer number of each UV-filter was calculated. For the impact on performance, the absorbance of a sunscreen was measured before and after recrystallization of the contained UV filter. This study confirmed the crystallinity of tested UV filters. The emulsifier was shown to influence the UV-filter recrystallization speed in emulsions. Continuous oil phase sunscreens were critical; all UV filters recrystallized promptly in oils and water-in-oil emulsions. Large molecule UV filters showed slowest recrystallization speed explained by a higher number of possible conformers. Finally, this work confirmed the negative impact of crystal formation on the delivered photoprotection of a sunscreen. "
"Abstract: The main objective of this study was to develop and evaluate the CNS delivery efficiency, distribution, therapeutic efficacy, and safety of cyclosporine A (CSA) using a cationic oil-in-water nanoemulsion system upon intranasal administration. An omega-3 fatty acid-rich, flaxseed oil-based nanoemulsion was used for intranasal delivery to the brain, and further magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate and confirm the transport of the positively charged CSA nanoemulsion (CSA-NE) in CNS. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory potential of CSA peptide was evaluated using the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model of neuroinflammation in rats. CSA-NE showed a good safety profile when tested in vitro in RPMI 2650 cells. Upon intranasal administration in rats, the nanoemulsion delivery system showed higher uptake in major regions of the brain based on changes in MRI T "
"Abstract: Background: Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated disease that varies widely in its clinical expression. Treatment options focus on relieving symptoms, reducing inflammation, induration, and scaling, and controlling the extent of the disease. While significant data on tazarotene in psoriasis has been available for over 20 years, its main utility is in acne. Objective: To review the clinical studies with tazarotene in psoriasis and establish its future role in the management of this chronic, incurable condition. Methods: An English language literature review was performed utilizing Medline, EMBASE, and the Web of Science to identify relevant articles, both clinical trials and reviews. Results: Tazarotene is a very effective treatment for plaque psoriasis, with significant reductions in both plaque elevation and scaling after 12 weeks. Efficacy appears to be dose and formulation dependent, and erythema less responsive. Tazarotene sustains clinical response posttreatment and may have an important role in maintenance therapy. The most common side effect is mild-to-moderate local irritation, which limited its role as a single agent for psoriasis. Efficacy is enhanced through combination with topical corticosteroids (TCS). Tazarotene may circumvent the problem of TCS tachyphylaxis, due to its sustained efficacy and provide tolerability benefits; tazarotene increases epidermal thickness and may reduce the risk of steroid-induced atrophy. In addition, tazarotene-induced irritation is reduced by the anti-inflammatory effect of TCS. A new fixed combination, well-tolerated tazarotene/halobetasol topical formulation is now available, which provides synergistic efficacy that is both rapid and sustained posttreatment. Conclusions: Tazarotene is a highly effective psoriasis treatment whose efficacy and tolerability can be enhanced through combination therapy with TCS, and a new fixed combination topical formulation of tazarotene and halobetasol may provide an optimal management approach.

"INTRODUCTION: Cyclosporine-A (CsA) is generally used as an immunosuppressant and is also prescribed for some ophthalmic applications such as vernal keratoconjunctivitis and dry eye. However, it is limited clinically due to its low aqueous solubility and ocular bioavailability. METHODS: In this work, lyophilized methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactide) (mPEG-PLA) polymer micelles were prepared for ophthalmic formulations as a promising nanocarrier for hydrophobic drugs like CsA. A mPEG-PLA diblock polymer was synthesized by ring opening polymerization and CsA was loaded into mPEG-PLA micelles by a simple film dispersion method. A uniform design of experiments was utilized to optimize the final formulation. The obtained formulation was characterized for diameter (57.0±3.2 nm), entrapment efficiency % (98.51±1.4), and in vitro release. Moreover, incorporating the stabilizer mPEG2000 could increase the in vitro stability of the lyophilized CsA-loaded mPEG-PLA micelles. RESULTS: Results showed a sustained release of CsA from the micelles. Drug concentration and time-dependent cytotoxicity of human corneal epithelial-2 cells was observed. Additionally, the transcorneal mechanism of mPEG-PLA micelles was studied and the results showed that the mPEG-PLA micelles mainly absorbed by a paracellular pathway via corneal epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together, the results proved that this mPEG-PLA diblock polymer can be potentially used as a nanoscopic carrier to deliver hydrophobic drugs in a controlled manner to the ocular region and, thus, deserves further attention.

"BACKGROUND: Facial redness is multifactorial in nature and may be a sign of many different conditions, including rosacea, photo damage and flushing. Herbal medicines have been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of dermatological conditions. Turmeric (Curcuma longa) and its constituents have been shown to mediate dilation and constriction of peripheral arterioles and have demonstrated anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of turmeric and turmeric-containing polyherbal combination tablets versus placebo on facial redness. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized pilot study. Thirty-three healthy participants were recruited from the dermatology clinic at the University of California, Davis and nearby community from 2016 to 2017. Thirty participants were enrolled, and 28 participants completed the study. The enrolled participants were randomized to receive one of three interventions (placebo, turmeric or polyherbal combination tablets) and were told to take the intervention tablets by mouth twice daily for 4 weeks. Facial redness was assessed at baseline and 4 weeks after intervention by clinical grading and by image-based analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was image-based facial quantification of redness using a research camera and software analysis system. The investigators performed an intention-to-treat analysis by including all subjects who were enrolled in the trial and received any study intervention. Differences were considered statistically significant after accounting for multiple comparisons. Effect sizes for clinical grading were calculated with a Hedges' g where indicated. RESULTS: Twenty-eight participants completed the study and there were no reported adverse events. Based on clinical grading, facial redness intensity and distribution down trended in the polyherbal combination group after 4 weeks (P = 0.1). Under photographic image analysis, the polyherbal combination group had a significant decrease in redness of 40% compared to baseline (P = 0.03). The placebo and turmeric groups had no statistically significant changes in image analysis-based facial redness. CONCLUSION: Polyherbal combination tablet supplementation improved facial redness compared to the turmeric or placebo. Overall, our findings suggested further investigations into the effects of turmeric and polyherbal formulations in skin conditions associated with facial redness would be warranted.

"BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris, a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit associated with socialisation and mental health problems, may affect more than 80% of teenagers. Isotretinoin is the only drug that targets all primary causal factors of acne; however, it may cause adverse effects. OBJECTIVES: To assess efficacy and safety of oral isotretinoin for acne vulgaris. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases up to July 2017: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and LILACS. We updated this search in March 2018, but these results have not yet been incorporated in the review. We also searched five trial registries, checked the reference lists of retrieved studies for further references to relevant trials, and handsearched dermatology conference proceedings. A separate search for adverse effects of oral isotretinoin was undertaken in MEDLINE and Embase up to September 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of oral isotretinoin in participants with clinically diagnosed acne compared against placebo, any other systemic or topical active therapy, and itself in different formulation, doses, regimens, or course duration. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included 31 RCTs, involving 3836 participants (12 to 55 years) with mild to severe acne. There were twice as many male participants as females.Most studies were undertaken in Asia, Europe, and North America. Outcomes were generally measured between eight to 32 weeks (mean 19.7 weeks) of therapy.Assessed comparisons included oral isotretinoin versus placebo or other treatments such as antibiotics. In addition, different doses, regimens, or formulations of oral isotretinoin were assessed, as well as oral isotretinoin with the addition of topical agents.Pharmaceutical companies funded 12 included trials. All, except three studies, had high risk of bias in at least one domain.Oral isotretinoin compared with oral antibiotics plus topical agentsThese studies included participants with moderate or severe acne and assessed outcomes immediately after 20 to 24 weeks of treatment (short-term). Three studies (400 participants) showed isotretinoin makes no difference in terms of decreasing trial investigator-assessed inflammatory lesion count (RR 1.01 95% CI 0.96 to 1.06), with only one serious adverse effect found, which was Stevens-Johnson syndrome in the isotretinoin group (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.98). However, we are uncertain about these results as they were based on very low-quality evidence.Isotretinoin may slightly improve (by 15%) acne severity, assessed by physician's global evaluation (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.32; 351 participants; 2 studies), but resulted in more less serious adverse effects (67% higher risk) (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.98; 351 participants; 2 studies), such as dry lips/skin, cheilitis, vomiting, nausea (both outcomes, low-quality evidence).Different doses/therapeutic regimens of oral isotretinoinFor our primary efficacy outcome, we found three RCTs, but heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. One study (154 participants) reported 79%, 80% and 84% decrease in total inflammatory lesion count after 20 weeks of 0.05, 0.1, or 0.2 mg/kg/d of oral isotretinoin for severe acne (low-quality evidence). Another trial (150 participants, severe acne) compared 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg/d oral isotretinoin for 20 weeks and, respectively, 58%, 80% and 90% of participants achieved 95% decrease in total inflammatory lesion count. One RCT, of participants with moderate acne, compared isotretinoin for 24 weeks at (a) continuous low dose (0.25 to 0.4 mg/kg/day), (b) continuous conventional dose (0.5 to 0.7 mg/kg/day), and (c) intermittent regimen (0.5 to 0.7 mg/kg/day, for one week in a month). Continuous low dose (MD 3.72 lesions; 95% CI 2.13 to 5.31; 40 participants; one study) and conventional dose (MD 3.87 lesions; 95% CI 2.31 to 5.43; 40 participants; one study) had a greater decrease in inflammatory lesion counts compared to intermittent treatment (all outcomes, low-quality evidence).Fourteen RCTs (906 participants, severe and moderate acne) reported that no serious adverse events were observed when comparing different doses/therapeutic regimens of oral isotretinoin during treatment (from 12 to 32 weeks) or follow-up after end of treatment (up to 48 weeks). Thirteen RCTs (858 participants) analysed frequency of less serious adverse effects, which included skin dryness, hair loss, and itching, but heterogeneity regarding the assessment of the outcome precluded data pooling; hence, there is uncertainty about the results (low- to very-low quality evidence, where assessed).Improvement in acne severity, assessed by physician's global evaluation, was not measured for this comparison.None of the included RCTs reported birth defects. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence was low-quality for most assessed outcomes.We are unsure if isotretinoin improves acne severity compared with standard oral antibiotic and topical treatment when assessed by a decrease in total inflammatory lesion count, but it may slightly improve physician-assessed acne severity. Only one serious adverse event was reported in the isotretinoin group, which means we are uncertain of the risk of serious adverse effects; however, isotretinoin may result in more minor adverse effects.Heterogeneity in the studies comparing different regimens, doses, or formulations of oral isotretinoin meant we were unable to undertake meta-analysis. Daily treatment may be more effective than treatment for one week each month. None of the studies in this comparison reported serious adverse effects, or measured improvement in acne severity assessed by physician's global evaluation. We are uncertain if there is a difference in number of minor adverse effects, such as skin dryness, between doses/regimens.Evidence quality was lessened due to imprecision and attrition bias. Further studies should ensure clearly reported long- and short-term standardised assessment of improvement in total inflammatory lesion counts, participant-reported outcomes, and full safety accounts. Oral isotretinoin for acne that has not responded to oral antibiotics plus topical agents needs further assessment, as well as different dose/regimens of oral isotretinoin in acne of all severities.

"Abstract: Recently, the bioactive properties of marine collagen and marine collagen hydrolysates have been demonstrated. Although there is some literature assessing the general chemical features and biocompatibility of collagen extracts from marine sponges, no data are available on the biological effects of sponge collagen hydrolysates for biomedical and/or cosmetic purposes. Here, we studied the in vitro toxicity, antioxidant, wound-healing, and photoprotective properties of four HPLC-purified fractions of trypsin-digested collagen extracts-marine collagen hydrolysates (MCHs)-from the marine sponge  "
"AIM: This study is aimed to formulate crocetin-loaded lipid Nanoparticles (NPs) and to evaluate its antioxidant properties in a cyclosporine A-mediated toxicity in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK-293) cells in vitro. MAIN METHODS: Crocetin-loaded NPs were prepared followed by physicochemical characterization. In vitro protective efficacy of crocetin and crocetin loaded NPs was investigated in cyclosporine A-mediated toxicity in HEK-293 cells by assessing free radical scavenging, DNA Nicking, cytotoxicity, intracellular Reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibition, Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMPs) loss and evaluating the activity and expression of antioxidant enzymes and non-enzyme level. Further, we have studied the mechanism of protective activity of crocetin either native or in NPs by studying the expression of phase II detoxifying proteins (HO-1) via Nrf2 mediated regulation. KEY FINDINGS: Our results showed that pretreatment with crocetin and crocetin-loaded NPs attenuated the cyclosporine A-mediated toxicity, ROS production and exhibited enhance free radical scavenging ability and cytoprotective activity. Further, the treatment prevented MMPs loss by directly scavenging the ROS and restored the antioxidant enzyme network with normalization of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression by inhibiting nuclear translocation of Nrf2. SIGNIFICANCE: Pretreatment of crocetin and crocetin-loaded NPs provided pronounce protective effect against cyclosporine A-mediated toxicity in HEK-293 cells by nullifying the ROS formation and restored antioxidant network through inhibition of Nrf2 translocation and followed by expression of HO-1. Such an approach may be anticipated to be beneficial for antioxidant therapy. "
"OBJECTIVE: Two studies were designed to evaluate the potential cosmetic benefit of a biomimetic, niacinamide-containing moisturizing cream for the first time in humans. METHODS: In both studies, healthy women were randomized to use two treatments, one for the left side of the body and one for the right, from three options: the test cream, a positive control or no treatment (use of standard cleanser only). Treatments were applied twice daily for 4 weeks to the face and forearms (Study 1) or the face only (Study 2). Instrumental and clinical skin assessments were performed by trained technicians. Study 1 involved tape stripping and a 5-day no-treatment ('regression') period at the end of the 4 weeks. Independent lay graders were asked to grade the skin texture of subjects in Study 2 from high-resolution photographs. RESULTS: In Study 1 (n = 66), the test cream significantly decreased the transepidermal water loss (TEWL) values on the forearm, and in the cheek area of the face, relative to baseline and compared to no treatment, and increased skin Corneometer values. The improvements were partially retained during a subsequent 5-day period of no treatment. Increases in TEWL values on skin subjected to tape stripping were significantly lower after 4 weeks of using the test cream compared to no treatment. In Study 2 (n = 72 subjects with visible signs of ageing), there was a favourable trend in the change from baseline of a skin roughness parameter, R CONCLUSION: Twice daily application of the test cream over 4 weeks had beneficial effects on skin barrier function, moisturization, wrinkle dimensions and elasticity compared to no treatment. These studies provide proof-of-concept evidence and highlight the cosmetic benefit of the biomimetic lamellar cream formulation. STUDY REGISTRATION: NCT03216265, NCT03180645. OBJECTIF: Deux études ont été conçues pour évaluer pour la première fois chez l’être humain l’éventuel bénéfice cosmétique d'une crème hydratante biomimétique contenant de la niacinamide. MÉTHODES: Dans les deux études, des femmes en bonne santé ont été randomisées pour utiliser deux traitements, un pour le côté gauche du corps et un pour le côté droit, choisis entre trois options : la crème testée, un contrôle positif ou aucun traitement (utilisation d'un nettoyant standard uniquement). Les traitements ont été appliqués deux fois par jour pendant 4 semaines sur le visage et les avant-bras (Étude 1) ou seulement sur le visage (Étude 2). Des évaluations instrumentales et cliniques de la peau ont été effectuées par des techniciens qualifiés. L’étude 1 impliquait un stripping et une période de 5 jours sans traitement (« régression ») à la fin des 4 semaines. Il a été demandé à des évaluateurs profanes indépendants d’évaluer la texture de la peau des participantes dans l’Étude 2 à partir de photographies à haute résolution. RÉSULTATS: Dans l’Étude 1 (n = 66), la crème testée a diminué de manière significative les valeurs de la perte en eau transépidermique (transepidermal water loss, TEWL) au niveau de l'avant-bras, et au niveau de la joue, par rapport à la valeur de base, et par rapport au groupe sans aucun traitement, et a augmenté les valeurs des paramètres cutanés mesurés avec un cornéomètre. Les améliorations ont été partiellement conservées pendant une période ultérieure de 5 jours sans aucun traitement. Des augmentations des valeurs TEWL sur la peau exposée à un décollement d'un ruban adhésif étaient significativement plus faibles après 4 semaines d'utilisation de la crème testée par rapport à l'absence de traitement. Dans l’Étude 2 (n = 72 participantes avec des signes visibles de vieillissement), il y avait une tendance favorable au niveau de la variation par rapport à la valeur de base du paramètre relatif à la rugosité de la peau, Ra, pour la crème testée par rapport à l'absence de traitement. Il y a eu des améliorations statistiquement significatives du score de Fitzpatrick pour les rides par rapport à l'absence de traitement, des diminutions des valeurs TEWL et une augmentation des valeurs des paramètres mesurés avec un cornéomètre et des valeurs des paramètres mesurés avec un cutomètre (paramètre élasticité R5). L’évaluation des images à haute résolution n'a pas permis de détecter les améliorations de la texture de la peau (définie par les pores, la finesse et les irrégularités) pour la crème testée par rapport à l'absence de traitement. Aucun événement indésirable grave ou sévère lié au traitement n'a été rapporté. CONCLUSION: Une application deux fois par jour de la crème testée pendant 4 semaines a eu des effets bénéfiques sur la fonction barrière de la peau, l'hydratation, l'aspect des rides et l’élasticité par rapport à l'absence de traitement. Ces études fournissent des éléments de preuve de concept et soulignent les bienfaits cosmétiques de la formule lamellaire biomimétique de la crème. Numéro d'enregistrement de l’étude : NCT03216265, NCT03180645. "
"BACKGROUND: Calcineurin inhibitors are a commonly used immunosuppressive drug and over 80% of lung transplant (LTx) recipients use tacrolimus. Sustained-release tacrolimus (SRT) was developed as a once-daily formulation, resulting in slower release and reduction in peak concentration compared with twice-daily immediate-release tacrolimus (IRT). Previous reports indicate that SRT may carry fewer side effects than IRT; however, the impact of SRT in bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) after LTx is unclear. OBJECTIVE: Our study objective was to evaluate the effect of SRT in BOS after LTx. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the effect of SRT for BOS among 75 LTx recipients who were alive in 2017 in our LTx program. All analyses were carried out using student t test or F test. RESULTS: Thirty-five recipients took IRT, 32 recipients used SRT, 7 recipients used cyclosporine, and 1 patient who received bone marrow and a lung graft from the same donor did not use a calcineurin inhibitor. The most frequent reason for conversion of IRT to SRT was kidney dysfunction, followed by other IRT complications. Five recipients underwent conversion of IRT to SRT because of decline of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) with fluctuation of the tacrolimus trough level. After induction of SRT, the fluctuation of the tacrolimus trough level was significantly reduced in 4 of 5 patients (P < .05). Before drug form conversion, the FEV1 in these 5 patients was significantly decreased; however, this exacerbation of FEV1 was attenuated after SRT induction (P < .05). CONCLUSION: SRT appeared to stabilize decline of FEV1 in patients with BOS possibly due to reducing the fluctuation of tacrolimus trough blood concentration. "
"Abstract: Staphylococcus aureus, a leading cause of serious human infections in both healthcare and community settings, is increasingly difficult to control due to expanding resistance to multiple antibiotic classes. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains have disseminated on a global scale and are associated with adverse patient outcomes, increased hospital stays, and significant economic costs to the healthcare system. A proximal step in S. aureus infection is colonization of the nasal mucosa, and effective strategies to decolonize high risk patients to reduce the risk of invasive infection and nosocomial spread represent an important clinical priority. With rising resistance to mupirocin, the most common antibiotic utilized for nasal MRSA decontamination, we are examining the use of pure molecular iodine (I "
"Abstract: Compounded topical preparations (CTP) were used to treat psoriasis until the last century and have disappeared from guidelines. The present authors report two severe psoriasis patients who were treated with CTP. A man had psoriasis with a PASI of 23 and a body surface area (BSA) of 43%. He had been using daily for several weeks a CTP including minoxidil, clobetasol propionate and hydroxyprogesterone formulated in an alcohol based vehicle. A woman suffered from psoriasis with an annular inflammatory pattern and a central healing. The PASI was 20 and the BSA was 30%. She had been using a CTP daily for 4 months including resorcinol, salicylic acid, 0.05% tretinoin cream, bethamethasone dipropionate cream. Until the 1970s, the dermatological textbooks recommended to treat severe psoriasis with CTP. Nowadays, CTP are considered outdated because of the large therapeutic armamentarium. The stability and benefit risks of the CTP used here were not documented. The use of CTP in psoriasis should be regulated and must be evidence based. Strict protocol and stability evaluation for preparations must be confirmed prior to compounding. "
"Abstract: Radiotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, as important representatives of current chemotherapy, are crucial and irreplaceable treatments of modern oncology. These two types of treatments frequently cause severe dose-dependent dermatologic adverse events that can negatively affect a patient's quality of life and compliance and cause inappropriate dose reductions and even treatment brakes. This article aims to emphasize new scientific data, published in peer reviews, regarding new possibilities to manage these debilitating dermatological adverse events. Since part of the scientific findings is new, the responsibility to enable pharmacologic treatment is in the compounding pharmacist domain. The article also suggests new formulations to the new pharmacologic treatment. "
"BACKGROUND: GSP301 nasal spray is a fixed-dose combination of the antihistamine olopatadine hydrochloride and the corticosteroid mometasone furoate intended for seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) treatment. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily or twice-daily GSP301 in a ragweed pollen environmental exposure chamber. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study, adults (18-65 years old) with SAR were equally randomized to 665 μg of olopatadine and 25 μg of mometasone (twice-daily GSP301), 665 μg of olopatadine and 50 μg of mometasone (once-daily GSP301), a US Food and Drug Administration-approved formulation of 137 μg of azelastine and 50 μg of fluticasone twice-daily (AzeFlu), a US Food and Drug Administration-approved formulation of 665 μg of olopatadine twice-daily, or placebo (twice-daily). During 2 visits (baseline and end of 14-day treatment), participants assessed SAR symptoms at specified time points. The primary end point-mean change from baseline in instantaneous total nasal symptom score (iTNSS) for twice-daily or once-daily GSP301 vs placebo-was analyzed by analysis of covariance. Onset of action, ocular symptoms, and adverse events were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 180 participants were randomized. Treatment with twice-daily or once-daily GSP301 provided statistically significant improvements in iTNSS vs placebo (twice-daily GSP301: least squares mean difference, -3.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.89 to -2.30; once-daily GSP301: least squares mean difference, -3.05; 95% CI, -4.35 to -1.76; P < .0001 for both). Significant improvements in iTNSS with twice-daily GSP301 occurred by 10 minutes after dosing (-1.26; 95% CI, -2.30 to -0.21; P = .02) and were maintained at all later time points except one (2.5 hours). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 22.2%, 30.6%, 25.0%, 22.2%, and 16.7% of participants in the twice-daily GSP301, once-daily GSP301, AzeFlu, olopatadine, and placebo groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: In an environmental exposure chamber model, twice-daily and once-daily GSP301 treatments were well tolerated and provided statistically significant and clinically meaningful SAR symptom improvement vs placebo.

"BACKGROUND: Buprenorphine is a potent lipophilic opioid analgesic that is largely used in the multimodal treatment of acute pain. Simbadol (buprenorphine hydrochloride) is the first and only FDA-approved high-concentration formulation of buprenorphine for use in cats. The aim of this study was to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of carprofen in combination with one of two commercial formulations of buprenorphine (Simbadol and Vetergesic, 1.8 mg/mL and 0.3 mg/mL, respectively) in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Twenty-four dogs were included in a randomized, prospective, controlled, clinical trial. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups as follows. Dogs were premedicated with acepromazine (0.02 mg/kg) and either 0.02 mg/kg of Vetergesic or Simbadol intramuscularly (Vetergesic group - VG; Simbadol group - SG, respectively; n = 12/group). General anesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with isoflurane in 100% oxygen. Carprofen (4.4 mg/kg SC) was administered after induction of anesthesia. Heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, pulse oximetry, pain scores using the Glasgow Composite Pain Scale Short Form (CMPS-SF), sedation scores using a dynamic interactive visual analogue scale and adverse events were evaluated before and after ovariohysterectomy by an observer who was unaware of treatment administration. If CMPS-SF scores were ≥ 5/20, dogs were administered rescue analgesia (morphine 0.5 mg/kg IM). Statistical analysis was performed using linear mixed models and Fisher's exact test (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Pain and sedation scores and physiological parameters were not significantly different between treatments. Three dogs in VG (25%) and none in SG (0%) required rescue analgesia (p = 0.109). Adverse effects (i.e. vomiting and melena) were observed in two dogs in SG and were thought to be related to stress and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of buprenorphine with carprofen preoperatively provided adequate postoperative analgesia for the majority of dogs undergoing OVH without serious adverse events. Prevalence of rescue analgesia was not significantly different between groups; however, it could be clinically relevant and explained by a type II error (i.e. small sample size). Future studies are necessary to determine if analgesic efficacy after Simbadol and Vetergesic is related to individual variability or pharmacokinetic differences. "
"Abstract: Topical application of Vitamin K1 has been demonstrated to effectively treat papulopustular skin rash, a serious and frequently encountered side effect of Epidermal Growth Factor Inhibitors (EGFRIs). Systemic absorption of vitamin K1 from skin and the resultant consequence of antagonizing EGFRIs anticancer effects jeopardizes the clinical acceptability of this rather effective treatment. The purpose of the present study was to rationally formulate and evaluate the release rate and transdermal absorption of a wide range of Vitamin K1 dermal preparations with a variety of physiochemical properties. A library of 33 formulations with were compounded and tested for Vitamin K1 permeation using hydrophobic membranes and porcine skin mounted in a Fran diffusion cells. Our results demonstrate the lowest diffusion for water-in-oil emulsions, which also demonstrated a negligible transdermal absorption. The statistical analysis showed a significant correlation between in vitro and ex vivo results. While viscosity did not have a significant impact on the diffusion or absorption of vitamin K1, an increase in the lipid content was correlated with an increase in transmembrane diffusion (not with transdermal absorption). Overall, formulation design significantly impacts the release rate and transdermal absorption of vitamin K1, and confirms the possibility of minimal systemic distribution of this vitamin for this specific purpose.

"Abstract: The fixed-combination of Cal/BD aerosol foam is now entering the Italian market. This drug was developed with a technology that allows an enhanced penetration of the active ingredients into the skin. This enhanced penetration improves local bioavailability and, consequently, Cal/BD aerosol foam therapy is associated with improved clinical outcomes if compared with other products with the same components. The efficacy and safety of Cal/BD aerosol foam were confirmed both in clinical trials and in ""field-practice"" studies. This short review discusses current evidence on the Cal/BD aerosol foam combination; some preliminary data collected in the Italian clinical practice will be also presented. "
"PURPOSE: The increasing trend of diversion of nonprescription drugs (NPDs) by adolescents or young adults is worrying. We implemented this pilot study before a national investigation to identify requests for suspected recreational use of psychoactive drugs made by young subjects to community pharmacies. METHODS: Thirty-eight French community pharmacies were asked to complete questionnaire (with age, gender of subjects; name, form, quantity of drugs) for each suspect request formulated by subjects under 26. Besides, pharmacists were asked about the regulatory measures they thought useful to decrease this diverted use by young people. Nineteen pharmacies participated. The study covered from December 12, 2016 to January 23, 2017. RESULTS: Forty-one requests mentioning 51 drugs were reported. They concerned males (85%) aged 20 years old on average, including 6 minors. The most frequent age class was that comprised between 18 and 20 years old. Codeine-containing drugs (29 reports) and promethazine (17 reports), the main components of the popular cocktail ""Purple drank,"" were the most requested, followed by dextromethorphan (3 reports). Fifteen drugs were requested in syrup form. One request concerned the prescription drug ketamine. Pharmacists suggested to schedule the concerned NPDs to prescription-only drugs and to increase the education of students as well as the public. CONCLUSIONS: Codeine and promethazine, the main components of the popular cocktail Purple drank, were the most requested. Suspect requests of psychoactive drugs made by adolescents or young adults in community pharmacies should be carefully surveyed and combined to the monitoring of falsified prescriptions. "

"INTRODUCTION: Lip plumpers are topical agents that offer immediate, but temporary, volumization of the lips. While these products are becoming increasingly popular and are available at multiple retailers, there is a lack of clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy, longevity, and safety of the lip plumping products. METHODS: This is a prospective, single center, clinical trial to evaluate the duration, efficacy, and safety of a lip plumping agent in two clinical visits. Lip volume and adverse event were assessed by two clinicians at various time points: 15 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, and 4 hours. RESULTS: Twenty-two subjects were enrolled in the study, and eighteen completed the study. Investigator assessments of global improvement 15 minutes after application of the lip plumping product demonstrated improvement in lip fullness in 100% of the subjects (18/18), and 1 hour post-application 67% (12/18) showed an improvement in lip fullness that was statistically significant compared to the 2-hour assessment (P less than 0.05). Subject evaluations noted improvement in lip fullness 15 minutes post-application in 94.4% (17/18) of subjects, and 1 hour post-application, 89% (16/18) of the subjects who completed the trial noted some improvement in the volume of their lips that was statistically significant compared to the 2-hour post-application time point (P less than 0.0001). Subjects noted that they did experience a tingling and heat sensation, but a majority noted that that this sensation lasted less than 15 minutes. DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrated that the lip plumping product increased lip volume in almost all patients 15 minutes post-application and showed a continued improvement in lip fullness per investigator assessments 1 hour after application. Adverse events of a tingling or heat sensation were expected and observed as the topical product contained capsaicin, cinnamon, and menthol, all of which can induce this sensation by the release of substance P.

"Abstract: Air pollution continues to be a global health concern and recent studies have shown that air pollutants can cause skin damage and skin aging through several pathways that induce oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and skin barrier dysfunction. Preventive measures need to be considered to retain optimal skin health, and topical skincare products may be able to alleviate the negative effects of air pollution on skin. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical usage study was conducted to assess the efficacy and tolerability of a novel two-part skincare system (LVS) that was developed to provide protection against environmental skin aggressors including air pollution. After 8 weeks of use in subjects exposed to extremely high levels of pollution, LVS provided significant improvements compared to placebo in all clinical efficacy parameters including crow's feet wrinkles, overall skin damage, skin tone evenness, tactile roughness, and visible redness. Subject self-assessment questionnaires showed that the treatment product was highly rated in self-perceived efficacy. Decreased SQOOH and MDA content in skin swab samples suggest that LVS helped to reduce oxidative stress in patients' skin. Histological analyses of biopsy samples using biomarkers related to skin structure, damage and function (collagen IV, MMP1, CPD, and CD1a) further support the clinical benefits of LVS. Altogether, the presented study is among the first to show that topical skincare products can help to reduce pollution-induced skin damage and improve skin quality, especially when specifically formulated with active ingredients that combat the harmful effects of air pollutants.

"Abstract: Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is the most common skin tumor seen by dermatologists in everyday practice. Although the lesions are mostly benign, many patients still elect to have asymptomatic SK removed. The historical standards of treatment are cryosurgery and electrocautery, two surgical options that are effective at lesion removal but have high rates of postoperative adverse events such as treatment-site scarring and pigmentary alterations. The cosmetic outcomes of SK treatment modalities are of keen interest to dermatologists, as the American population becomes increasingly more diverse. In this article, the inclusion of darker Fitzpatrick skin types into clinical studies investigating post-treatment side effects of SK therapy is reviewed. The recent approval of a 40% hydrogen peroxide topical formulation is discussed in light of these issues, and several non-invasive topical treatments that optimize cosmetic outcomes of SK lesion removal are highlighted. Finally, treatment strategies aimed at reducing cost and minimizing the burden of adverse sequelae are provided. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(9):933-940. "
"Abstract: Apart from being an analogue of the prototype for photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), 2-ethylhexyl 4-dimethylaminobenzoate (EHDMABA) is also one of the earliest patented and most commonly used sunscreen components. There is, however, little documented information about the photophysics and factors affecting the photophysics of this molecule. Such information is of importance for both the understanding of the ICT reaction and assessing the underlying process of photoprotection, especially in view of the ""sunscreen controversy"" that has arisen from the contrasting in vivo vs. in vitro photobiological results on this and related UV filters. We report herein a femtosecond broadband time-resolved fluorescence (fs-TRF), complemented by transient absorption (fs-TA) to allow a full probe of the excited state cascades for EHDMABA and two of its derivatives in solvents of varied properties. The results provide direct evidence for a nearly solvent independent inner sphere ICT reaction occurring on the sub-picosecond time scale, and an ensuing solvent dictated deactivation of the ICT state. The ICT state in the aprotic solvent acetonitrile decayed solely through the intrinsic intersystem crossing (ISC) to produce a potentially harmful triplet excited state. In the protic solvent, the solvation and formation of ICT-induced solute-solvent hydrogen (H)-bonding opened the originally inaccessible internal conversion (IC) channel of the ICT state, leading to the rapid reformation of the ground state molecule with a unitary efficiency in the aqueous solution. This H-bonding-mediated IC restrained or eliminated the intrinsic ISC, providing a mechanism at the molecular level for the benign dissipation of the electronic excitation. The precise rate of IC was observed to vary with the alkoxy substituent and its efficiency was affected by the H-bonding capacity of the solvent. The findings of this work demonstrate the pivotal role of the microenvironment and the direct participation of solvent molecules through H-bonding in drastically altering the nonradiative dynamics and promoting or inhibiting photostability and photoprotection. This may assist in developing next-generation UV filters and help in improving formulation design for the optimal efficacy of sunscreen products. The pronounced H-bonding-induced fluorescence quenching and variation in the fluorescence wavelength imply that these molecules may also serve as a sensitive fluorescence probe for the H-bonding properties of the microenvironment.

"BACKGROUND: Acne is a multifactorial skin disease associated with pilosebaceous unit and caused by bacteria Propionibacterium acnes and Acne vulgaris. Near about 95% people throughout the world suffer from acne at some point in their life span. This disease is more prominent in adults compared to neonates and prepubescent children. Conventionally it is treated with either creams or gels having large number of side effects on patients. METHODS: We searched about recent advancements in the use of nanotechnological carriers for effective treatment of acne. We focused on the use of liposomes, niosomes, microemulsions, microsponge, microspheres, and nanoparticles to improve anti-acne therapy. Patents regarding use of nanocarrier systems to eliminate acne were also discussed in this review. RESULTS: The encapsulation of anti-acne drugs in various nanotechnological carriers improve their efficacy and reduce side effects. These carriers show controlled drug release and improved drug penetration even upto pilosebaceous unit of skin. Local tolerability of anti-acne molecules can be improved by adjusting the concentration in nanotechnological carriers. CONCLUSIONS: Nanotechnological carriers have opened a new window to design novel, effective and low dose systems for effective eradication acne disease. However, very few nanocarrier based formulations are available in market for topical use and much progress is required in this field to improve anti-acne therapy. "
"Abstract: Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) are being used extensively in manufacturing skin lotions and food products and in various biological and pharmaceutical industries because of their immunomodulatory and antimicrobial properties. In this study, ZnONPs were synthesized by a precipitation method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy to investigate their structural, morphological, and optical properties. For in vivo evaluation, 40 healthy albino mice were randomly allocated to four equal groups among which the first one was the control group, while the second, third, and fourth were treated with carbon tetrachloride (CCl "
"IMPORTANCE: Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) is a heterogeneous group of disorders caused by defects in signaling pathways involved in epidermal proliferation and differentiation, leading to a wide range of skin manifestations. Therapeutic options are limited and often unsatisfactory. Topical cholesterol and statin as a combined formulation has proven successful in the treatment of patients with CHILD syndrome (congenital hemidysplasia ichthyosis and limb defects). OBJECTIVE: To assess change in disease severity score after a 3-month therapeutic regimen consisting of a glycolic acid, 10% to 20%, cream and a combination cream of lovastatin, 2%, with cholesterol, 2%, in the treatment of ARCI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case series of 15 patients with ARCI was conducted at the American University of Beirut, a referral center in the Middle East region for genodermatoses, between May 2017 and January 2018. No age groups were excluded; all patients were from the Middle East area; and all were initially not responsive to treatment with hydrating creams in combination with urea creams, 30% to 40%, or glycolic acid, 10% to 20%. Excluded were patients who had been taking systemic retinoids within 3 months before the start of the study. INTERVENTIONS: A 3-month therapeutic regimen of glycolic acid, 10% to 20%, cream and a combination of lovastatin, 2%, with cholesterol, 2%, cream. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Percentage change in disease severity scores following 2 and 3 months of study treatment. RESULTS: Of the 15 patients included in the study, 10 were male (mean age, 11.2 years; age range, 2-38 years). The average percentage reduction in the disease severity score was 33.7% at 2 months (from 60.8 to 40.2) and 57.5% at 3 months (from 60.8 to 21.9). Adverse effects were mild and consisted mainly of irritation and burning. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest a benefit from a treatment regimen consisting of glycolic acid, 10% to 20%, and a combination of lovastatin, 2%, with cholesterol, 2%, in the treatment of ARCI. This combination of creams might also prove to be beneficial in other types of ichthyoses and other dermatological diseases with a defective skin barrier. "
"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Acne vulgaris is a common inflammatory skin condition which is treated using Tretinoin (TRE), a widely used retinoid. Nano emulations (NEs) are colloidal nano-sized particles that enhance the therapeutic efficacy of TRE and minimize adverse effects. This study is aimed at developing a TRE-loaded NE (NE-TRE) and at assessing the therapeutic effects of the formulation in acne vulgaris lesions, compared to conventional 0.05% TRE emulsion. METHOD: The high energy emulsification method was used to make NE-TRE. After obtaining stable NE, particle characterization and physicochemical properties were evaluated under accelerated conditions. Conducting a clinical study, we compared the therapeutic effects of NE-TRE and 0.05% TRE emulsion by comparing the number of acne lesions and porphyrin production in both sides of the face. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We successfully developed stable nanoparticles. It was a stable oil-in-water emulsion with particle size of about 150 nm, and containing circular and separated particles. In a pilot clinical study, the number of acne lesions as well as the size and intensity of porphyrin production significantly reduced after topical application of NE-TRE. This formula shows proper efficiency and good loading capacity of TRE in the drug delivery system. "
"PURPOSE: The present investigation was aimed at developing Teriflunomide (TEF) and Methotrexate (MTX) loaded hydroxyapatite nanoparticles and increasing tolerability towards combination therapy against rheumatoid arthritis by reducing hepatotoxicity. METHODS: Drug-loaded HAp-NPs were synthesized by wet-chemical precipitation method and optimized by Box-Behnken experimental design. The developed NPs were subjected to in vitro and in vivo characterization. In-vivo pharmacodynamics and biochemical studies were performed on adjuvant- induced arthritis model treated with different formulations; MTX-TEF-SOL, TEF-HAp-NP, MTX-HAp-NP, TEF-MTX-HAp-NP, FOLITRAX-10 and AUBAGIO. RESULTS: The size of the optimized formulations, TEF-HAp-NP and MTX-HAp-NP, was found to be 224.3 ± 83.80 nm and 268.3 ± 73.86 nm with drug loading 53.11 ± 0.84% and 67.04 ± 1.12% respectively. In vitro release of TEF from TEF-HAp-NP (70.41 ± 1.22%) and MTX from MTX-HAp-NP (82.43 ± 1.31%) up to 24 h revealed sustained release pattern. Results of the arthritic assessment study showed a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in ankle diameter (61.30 ± 7.42) and arthritis score (2.35 ± 0.24) with a marked restoration of ankle joint micro-architecture in TEF-MTX-HAp-NP treated group. During Hepatotoxicity studies, liver histopathology revealed that the formulation MTX-TEF-HAp-NP was least hepatotoxic with less hepatocyte swelling and fibrous connective tissue proliferation while Folitrax-10 was found to be most hepatotoxic. Biochemical studies revealed that Folitrax-10 significantly (P < 0.05) increased the GOT (313.64 ± 16) and GPT level (334.46 ± 13) while insignificant (P > 0.05) change in GOT (263.68 ± 17) and GPT (229.38 ± 10) level was recorded with TEF-MTX-HAp-NP. CONCLUSIONS: We report that the subcutaneous delivery of TEF-MTX-HAp-NP was most effective as it successfully reduced the dosage by half for maximizing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing side effects.

"BACKGROUND: Unique whole formula nature-based sensitive skin products are formulated to minimize irritation while providing conditioning and soothing benefits to clinically diagnosed sensitive skin. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the efficacy and tolerability of a regimen of cleanser containing natural oils, beeswax, and witch hazel, and day & night creams containing natural oils, glycerin, and botanical anti-inflammatories (NR); and a synthetic dermatologist-recommended regimen of cetyl alcohol, sodium lauryl sulphate-containing cleanser and glycerin, polyisobutene-containing lotion (CR) in clinically diagnosed sensitive skin resulting from eczema/atopic dermatitis, rosacea, or cosmetic intolerance. METHODS: 120 subjects were randomized to receive either NR or CR, twice daily for 4 weeks in this double-blind study. Blinded investigator-rated and subject-rated overall skin appearance was assessed using a 5-point scale (0=none, 4=severe) at baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks. Noninvasive skin assessments for skin hydration and skin barrier function were made by corneometry and TEWL, respectively. RESULTS: NR resulted in a 34% improvement from baseline in investigator-rated overall skin appearance (P less than 0.001); and CR resulted in a 4% improvement. Similar NR and CR results were found in the other efficacy parameters: tactile and visual smoothness, clarity, and radiance. Both regimens improved barrier function from baseline to week 4 (17%, 15%; NR, CR, P equals NS). NR maintained hydration from baseline to week 4 while CR increased hydration by 21% (P less than 0.001). No clinically significant tolerability issues were reported in either regimen at week 4. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that NR was effective, well tolerated, and superior to CR in the management of sensitive skin. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(8):908-913. "
"Abstract: Cyclosporine is one of the main drugs used for the prophylaxis of graft versus host disease in bone marrow transplanted patients. Hypersensitivity reaction to intravenous cyclosporine is rare and might be due to its vehicle polyoxyethylated castor oil, Cremophor EL. The exact mechanism is unknown, but IgE and IgG antibodies, complement, and histamine release have been considered to play a role in the development of this reaction. Here, we describe a case of anaphylaxis to intravenous cyclosporine, which was developed in a 19-year-old Iranian female with acute myeloid leukemia who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from her sister. The corn oil-based soft gelatin capsule (Sandimmune "
"Abstract: Psoriasis is one of the most common chronic autoinflammatory skin disease, associated with hyperproliferation and abnormal differentiation of keratinocytes, inflammation, and angiogenesis. The available treatments for psoriasis are not curative and may have numerous side effects, and topical administration is preferred over systemic therapy due to the reduced systemic burden of the drug. Thus, novel and more efficacious formulations of anti-inflammatory and/or differentiating compounds for topical application could be very useful for the disease management and for improving the quality of life of the patients. Here we evaluated the potential as anti-psoriatic of an equimolar mixture of two compounds, 2,4-Monofurfurylidene-tetra-O-methylsorbitol (Compound A) and 4,6-dimethyl-2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylamino)pyrimidine (Compound B), that, used individually, are known to possess immunomodulating properties (Compound A) and keratolitic and anti-inflammatory activity (Compound B). Human immortalized keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT cells) and primary human keratinocyte cells from adult donor (HEKa) were used as in vitro experimental models. We show that the mix A + B exhibits antiproliferative activity and induces terminal differentiation more efficiently than compounds A and B used individually. We confirm that the compound B is the active ingredient of the mixture and the mainly responsible for anti-psoriatic activity, but the mix A + B is more effective and possesses lower cytotoxicity than the compound B alone. This could be ascribable to the association with compound A, that is known to possess, in addition to the immunomodulating ability, antioxidant and antiradical action. Our results indicate that mix A + B could be a suitable candidate for a new cosmeceutical formulation for topical treatment of psoriasis. "
"Abstract: Methotrexate has been used in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) since the 1980s and to this day is often the first line medication for RA treatment. In this review, we examine multiple hypotheses to explain the mechanism of methotrexate efficacy in RA. These include folate antagonism, adenosine signaling, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), decrease in adhesion molecules, alteration of cytokine profiles, and polyamine inhibition amongst some others. Currently, adenosine signaling is probably the most widely accepted explanation for the methotrexate mechanism in RA given that methotrexate increases adenosine levels and on engagement of adenosine with its extracellular receptors an intracellular cascade is activated promoting an overall anti-inflammatory state. In addition to these hypotheses, we examine the mechanism of methotrexate in RA from the perspective of its adverse effects and consider some of the newer genetic markers of methotrexate efficacy and toxicity in RA. Lastly, we briefly discuss the mechanism of additive methotrexate in the setting of TNF-α inhibitor treatment of RA. Ultimately, finding a clear explanation for the pathway and mechanism leading to methotrexate efficacy in RA, there may be a way to formulate more potent therapies with fewer side effects. "
"Abstract: In vitro three-dimensional human skin models are an innovative alternative to evaluate cytotoxicity and phototoxicity in the cosmetic industry. The aim of this study was to use a skin model to evaluate the potential toxicity of sunscreen formulations with or without exposure to UV radiation. In addition, the toxicity of these formulations was evaluated after exposure to photodegradation. The results showed toxicity with all formulations/conditions tested, including the control formulation, compared to PBS. Cell viability of photodegraded formulations - prior to the phototoxicity radiation process - was higher, indicating that some formulation components were degraded into products with reduced toxicity. The results also indicated that avobenzone was more unstable/toxic than octyl p-methoxycinnamate under the same test conditions. The sunscreens and their formulations were shown to be toxic to skin model cells to some extent, even when not exposed to UV irradiation; however the biological role of this toxicity is unclear. This result shows the importance of testing sunscreen formulations in real in-use conditions. Finally, since we used an in vitro assay based on a human cell model, this non-invasive technique represents a suitable alternative to animal models for phototoxicity tests in general and could have application in screening new sunscreen products.

"Abstract: Dandruff is a common condition, affecting up to half the global population of immunocompetent adults at some time during their lives and it has been highly correlated with the over-expression of the fungus Malassezia spp. Climbazole (CBZ) is used as an antifungal and preservative agent in many marketed formulations for the treatment of dandruff. While the efficacy of CBZ in vitro and in vivo has previously been reported, limited information has been published about the uptake and deposition of CBZ in the skin. Hence, our aim was to investigate the skin permeation of CBZ as well as the influence of various solvents on CBZ skin delivery. Four solvents were selected for the permeability studies of CBZ, namely propylene glycol (PG), octyl salicylate (OSal), Transcutol® P (TC) and polyethylene glycol 200 (PEG). The criteria for selection were based on their wide use as excipients in commercial formulations, their potential to act as skin penetration enhancers and their favourable safety profiles. 1% (w/v) solutions of CBZ were applied under infinite and finite dose conditions using Franz type diffusion cells to human and porcine skin. In line with the topical use of CBZ as an antidandruff agent, comparatively low amounts of CBZ penetrated across the skin barrier (<1% of the applied dose of CBZ). Finite dose studies resulted in a higher extraction of CBZ from human skin compared with infinite dose studies (p < 0.05). CBZ was also taken up to a higher extent in porcine skin (>7-fold) compared with human skin (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, no statistical differences were observed in the amounts that permeated across the different membranes. These preliminary results confirm the potential of simple formulations of CBZ to target the outer layers of the epidermis. The PG and OSal formulations appear to be promising vehicles for CBZ in terms of overall skin extraction and penetration. Future work will expand the range of vehicles studied and explore the reasons underlying the retention of CBZ in the outer layers of the skin. "

"Abstract: The therapeutic application of deoxypodophyllotoxin (DPT) is limited due to its poor water solubility and stability. In the present study, the micelles assembled by the amphiphilic block copolymers (mPEG-PDLLA) were constructed to improve the solubility and safety of DPT for their in vitro and in vivo application. The central composite design was utilized to develop the optimal formulation composed of 1221.41 mg mPEG-PDLLA, the weight ratio of 1 : 4 (mPEG-PDLLA : DPT), 30 mL hydration volume and the hydration temperature at 40 °C. The results showed that the micelles exhibited uniformly spherical shape with the diameter of 20 nm. The drug-loading and entrapment efficiency of deoxypodophyllotoxin-polymeric micelles (DPT-PM) were about (20 ± 2.84)% and (98 ± 0.79)%, respectively, indicating that the mathematical models predicted well for the results. Compared to the free DPT, the cytotoxicity showed that blank micelles possessed great safety for Hela cells. In addition, the DPT loaded micelle formulation achieved stronger cytotoxicity at the concentration of 1 × 10 "
"Abstract: In recent years inorganic materials are largely present in products intended for health care. Literature gives many examples of inorganic materials used in many healthcare products, mainly in pharmaceutical field. Silver, zinc oxide, titanium oxide, iron oxide, gold, mesoporous silica, hydrotalcite-like compound and nanoclays are the most common inorganic materials used in nanosized form for different applications in the health field. Generally, these materials are employed to realize formulations for systemic use, often with the aim to perform a specific targeting to the pathological site. The nanometric dimensions are often preferred to obtain the cellular internalization when the target is localized in the intracellular space. Some materials are frequently used in topical formulations as rheological agents, adsorbents, mattifying agents, physical sunscreen (e.g. zinc oxide, titanium dioxide), and others. Recent studies highlighted that the use of nanosized inorganic materials can represent a risk for health. The very small dimension (nanometric) until a few years ago represented a fundamental requirement; however, it is currently held responsible for the inorganic material toxicity. This aspect is very important to be considered as actually numerous inorganic materials can be found in many products available in the market, often dedicated to infants and children. These materials are used without taking into account their dimensional properties with increased risk for the user/patient. This review deals with a deep analysis of current researches documenting the toxicity of nanometric inorganic materials especially those largely used in products available in the market. "
"Abstract: The control of agricultural pests through eco-friendly nanopesticides is a challenge of crucial environmental importance nowadays. The current study was aimed to discover a novel biopesticides through Trichoderma viride mediated synthesis of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TDNPs). The main chemical and physical features of the TDNPs were assessed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and size distribution and shape of the NPs studied through the scanning electron microscope (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The extracellular synthesized nanoparticles were evaluated for their larvicidal, antifeedant and pupicidal activities against Helicoverpa armigera. TDNPs exhibited highest mortality rate on first (100%), second (100%) and third (92.34%), instar larvae of H. armigera at 100 ppm. The detoxifying enzymes such as, β-glucosidase and carboxylesterase were reduced whereas glutathione S-transferase increased during the treatment of TDNPs against H. armigera at 100 ppm. No toxic effects were found on Eudrilus eugeniae filter paper and artificial soil assays treated with TDNPs at 100 ppm. However, cypermethrin was toxic to earthworms after 72 h treatment. Therefore, TDNPs could act as significant inhibitors on the development of H. armigera, although, no adverse effect was found on earthworms. "
"BACKGROUND: Conventional pharmacological therapies for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) consist of non-biological, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, among which methotrexate (MTX) is the most commonly prescribed. However, there is a lack of consensus-based clinical and therapeutic recommendations for the use of MTX in the management of patients with JIA. Therefore, the Methotrexate Advice and RecommendAtions on Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (MARAJIA) Expert Meeting was convened to develop evidence-based recommendations for the use of MTX in the treatment of JIA. METHODS: The preliminary executive committee identified a total of 9 key clinical issues according to the population, intervention, comparator, outcome (PICO) approach, and performed an evidence-based, systematic, literature review. During the subsequent Expert Meeting, the relevant evidence was assessed and graded, and 10 recommendations were made. RESULTS: Recommendations relating to the efficacy, optimal dosing and route of administration and duration of treatment with MTX in JIA, and to the issue of folic acid supplementation to prevent MTX side effects, use of MTX in the treatment of chronic JIA-associated uveitis, combination treatment with biologic agents, and the use of vaccinations in patients with JIA were developed. The selected topics were considered to represent clinically important issues facing clinicians caring for patients with JIA. Evidence was insufficient to formulate recommendations for the use of biomarkers predictive of treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: These consensus recommendations provide balanced and evidence-based recommendations designed to have broad value for physicians and healthcare clinicians involved in the clinical management of patients with JIA.

"Abstract: Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune skin disorder affecting 2-3% of the world population. It has characteristic features such as increased keratinocyte proliferation and production of inflammatory mediators. The treatment involves various strategies including topical, systemic, phototherapy and biologics. Topical therapies are preferred for mild to moderate psoriasis conditions over the systemic therapies which are ideal in severe disease conditions. The systemic therapies include immunosuppressants, biological agents and recently approved phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitors. There are various limitations associated with the existing therapies where the new findings in the pathogenesis of psoriasis are paving a path for newer therapeutics to target at the molecular level. Various small molecules, PDE-4 inhibitors, biologics, and immunomodulator proved efficacious including the new molecules targeting Janus kinases (JAK) inhibitors that are under investigation. Furthermore, the role of genetic and miRNAs in psoriasis is still not completely explored and may further help in improving the treatment efficacy. This review provides an insight into various emerging therapies along with currently approved treatments for psoriasis. "
"Abstract: Skin has been increasingly recognized as an important drug administration route with topical formulations, offering a targeted approach for the treatment of several dermatological disorders. The effectiveness of this route is hampered by its natural barrier, the stratum corneum (SC), and hence, different strategies have been investigated to improve percutaneous drug transport. The design of nanodelivery systems, aiming at solving skin delivery issues, have been largely explored, due to their potential to revolutionize dermal therapies, improving therapeutic effectiveness and reducing side effects. Apart from nanosystem benefits, the fulfilment of the reproducibility requirements and quality standards still limit their industrial production. The optimization of nanosystem formulation and manufacturing process is complex, usually involving a large number of variables. Therefore, a science- and risk-oriented approach, such as Quality by Design (QbD) will provide a comprehensive and noteworthy knowledge, yielding high quality drug products without extensive regulatory burden. This review aims to set up the basis for QbD development approach, encompassing preliminary and systematic risk assessments, with critical process parameters (CPPs) and critical material attributes (CMAs) identification, of different nanosystems potentially used in dermal therapies.

"Abstract: The cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) is a potentially mutagenic DNA photolesion that is the basis of most skin cancers. There are no data on DNA protection by sunscreens under typical conditions of use. The study aim was to determine such protection, in phototypes I/II, with representative sunscreen-user application. A very high SPF formulation was applied at 0.75, 1.3 and 2.0 mg/cm2. Unprotected control skin was exposed to 4 standard erythema doses (SED) of solar simulated UVR, and sunscreen-treated sites to 30 SED. Holiday behaviour was also simulated by UVR exposure for 5 consecutive days. Control skin received 1 SED daily, and sunscreen-treated sites received 15 (all 3 application thicknesses) or 30 (2.0 mg/cm2) SED daily. CPD were assessed by quantitative HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) and semi-quantitative immunostaining. In comparison with unprotected control sites, sunscreen significantly (p ≤ 0.001-0.05) reduced DNA damage at 1.3 and 2.0 mg/cm2 in all cases. However, reduction with typical sunscreen use (0.75 mg/cm2) was non-significant, with the exception of HPLC-MS/MS data for the 5-day study (p <0.001). Overall, these results support sunscreen use as a strategy to reduce skin cancer, and demonstrate that public health messages must stress better sunscreen application to get maximal benefit. "
"BACKGROUND: Upadacitinib is a selective inhibitor of Janus kinase 1 and was efficacious in phase 2 studies in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. We aimed to assess the efficacy of upadacitinib in patients with inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). METHODS: This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 150 sites in 35 countries. We enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with active rheumatoid arthritis for 3 months or longer, who had received csDMARDs for at least 3 months with a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before study entry, and had an inadequate response to at least one of the following csDMARDs: methotrexate, sulfasalazine, or leflunomide. Using interactive response technology, we randomly assigned patients receiving stable background csDMARDs (2:2:1:1) to receive a once-daily extended-release formulation of upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg, or placebo, for 12 weeks. Patients, investigators, and the funder were masked to allocation. After 12 weeks, patients taking placebo received 15 mg or 30 mg of upadacitinib once daily, according to the prespecified randomisation assignment. The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients at week 12 who achieved 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20), and a 28-joint disease activity score using C-reactive protein (DAS28[CRP]) of 3·2 or less. We did efficacy analyses in the full analysis set of all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug, and used non-responder imputation for assessment of the primary outcomes. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02675426. FINDINGS: Between Dec 17, 2015, and Dec 22, 2016, 1083 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 661 were recruited and randomly assigned to receive upadacitinib 15 mg (n=221), upadacitinib 30 mg (n=219), or placebo (n=221). All patients received at least one dose of study drug, and 618 (93%) completed 12 weeks of treatment. At week 12, ACR20 was achieved by 141 (64%; 95% CI 58-70) of 221 patients receiving upadacitinib 15 mg and 145 (66%; 60-73) of 219 patients receiving upadacitinib 30 mg, compared with 79 (36%; 29-42) of 221 patients receiving placebo (p<0·0001 for each dose vs placebo). DAS28(CRP) of 3·2 or less was met by 107 (48%; 95% CI 42-55) patients receiving upadacitinib 15 mg and 105 (48%; 41-55) patients receiving upadacitinib 30 mg, compared with 38 (17%; 12-22) patients receiving placebo (p<0·0001 for each dose vs placebo). Adverse events were reported in 125 (57%) of 221 patients receiving upadacitinib 15 mg, 118 (54%) of 219 patients receiving upadacitinib 30 mg, and 108 (49%) of 221 patients receiving placebo. The most frequently reported adverse events (≥5% of patients in any group) were nausea (16 [7%] of 221 in the upadacitinib 15 mg group; three [1%] of 219 in the upadacitinib 30 mg group; and seven [3%] of 221 in the placebo group), nasopharyngitis (12 [5%]; 13 [6%]; and nine [4%]), upper respiratory tract infection (12 [5%]; 12 [5%]; and nine [4%]), and headache (nine [4%]; seven [3%]; and 12 [5%]). More infections were reported for upadacitinib (64 [29%] of 221 patients receiving 15 mg and 69 [32%] of 219 patients receiving 30 mg) versus placebo (47 [21%] of 221 patients). There were three herpes zoster infections (one [<1%] in the placebo group, one [<1%] in the upadacitinib 15 mg group, and one [<1%] in the upadacitinib 30 mg group) and one primary varicella zoster virus infection (one [<1%] in the upadacitinib 30 mg group), two malignancies (both in the upadacitinib 30 mg group), one adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular event (in the upadacitinib 30 mg group), and five serious infections (one [<1%] in the placebo group, one [<1%] in the upadacitinib 15 mg group, three [1%] in the upadacitinib 30 mg group). No deaths were reported during the trial. INTERPRETATION: Patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who received upadacitinib (15 mg or 30 mg) in combination with csDMARDs showed significant improvements in clinical signs and symptoms.

"BACKGROUND: This study evaluated whether a multi-ingredient surfactant colloidal silver technology was noninferior to a 4% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) antiseptic on immediate and persistent antimicrobial activity. METHODS: The inguinal regions of 81 healthy adults were demarcated into 4 quadrants, and 3 were used for testing each product at baseline, 10 minutes, and 6 hours postapplication. The log of the number of colony forming units was obtained using a cylinder sampling technique. The 95% confidence interval of the test product to the control product with a margin of 0.65 was established as the upper limit of noninferiority. RESULTS: A total of 81 individuals were enrolled. The colloidal silver product was found to be noninferior to 4% CHG at both 10 minutes and 6 hours postapplication. CONCLUSIONS: The colloidal silver-based product was noninferior to the 4% CHG product at 10 minutes and 6 hours postapplication. "
"Abstract: Topical treatment is the mainstay of acne therapy. The most commonly prescribed topical medications for acne include benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, and retinoids. Despite their effectiveness in treating mild to moderate acne vulgaris, these topical medications are found to be irritating, and are historically associated with poor tolerability and diminished patient adherence. Thus, choosing the right formulation that will be effective and well tolerated is essential. Novel formulations that optimize drug concentration and utilize improved delivery vehicles have helped to enhance the tolerability and efficacy, and allow for less frequent application or co-application of drugs that were previously considered incompatible. This article will review the goals of topical therapy for the treatment of acne, in addition to common therapies and their challenges. Advanced formulations and combination formulations of benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, and tretinoin will also be discussed. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(6 Suppl):s6-10. "
"INTRODUCTION: Several therapeutic modalities from topicals to chemical peels and energy-based devices are available to improve skin quality and reduce the appearance of wrinkles in the face and neck area. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this single-center, double blinded, placebo-controlled study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Nimni Cream by Hydropeptide® on skin quality and wrinkles. METHODS: 20 patients were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to use either Nimni Cream by Hydropeptide or placebo starting with twice a week application and increasing to daily for 8 weeks. Patient and investigator assessments were conducted on week 4 and 8. RESULTS: At week 8, blinded and treating investigator assessments showed a statistically significant improvement in global aesthetic improvement scale assessments in the active group for the face, but not the neck area. There was also a trend towards improvement in Fitzpatrick Wrinkle Scale scores in the active, but not placebo group, at both time-points, for the face and neck, but the results were not statistically significant. The majority of patients were satisfied with the results and no adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSION: Nimni Cream by Hydropeptide is safe and effective for improving skin quality in the face and can be considered a satisfactory therapeutic option adjuvant to aesthetic procedures.

"BACKGROUND: Azelaic acid demonstrates anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-comedogenic, and anti-microbial effects. Azelaic acid 20% cream is currently approved for the treatment of acne vulgaris, and azelaic acid 15% foam has recently been approved for rosacea. Given the favorable tolerability profile of foam preparations, it is reasonable to assume that azelaic acid 15% foam could serve as a viable treatment option for facial acne. OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy and safety of azelaic acid 15% foam in the treatment of moderate-to-severe facial acne Methods: Twenty subjects with moderate-to-severe facial acne vulgaris were enrolled in this two-center, open-label pilot study. All study subjects were treated with azelaic acid 15% foam for 16 weeks. Efficacy analyses were based on the change in facial investigator global assessment (FIGA) and changes in total, inflammatory, non-inflammatory lesion counts between baseline and week 16. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in FIGA scores from baseline to week 16 (p = .0004), with 84% of subjects experiencing at least a 1 grade improvement, and 63% of subjects achieving a final grade of Clear or Almost Clear. All subjects experienced reductions in inflammatory and total lesion counts by week 16, and 89% of subjects experienced reductions in non-inflammatory lesions. Azelaic acid 15% foam was well tolerated, with almost all instances of erythema, dryness, peeling, oiliness, pruritus, and burning being of mild or trace degree, and most adverse effects resolving by the end of the study. CONCLUSION: Azelaic acid 15% foam is effective and safe in the treatment of facial acne vulgaris. Given the convenience of foam vehicles, azelaic acid 15% foam should be considered as a viable treatment option for this condition. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(6):641-645. "
"Abstract: Ocular surface disease (OSD) is a highly prevalent symptomatic condition caused by dry eye disease (DED), intrinsic, environmental, or iatrogenic causes. It affects patient's visual function and quality of life. Its pathophysiology is centered on tear hyperosmolarity, inflammation, and epithelial damage. Current management is suboptimal and includes artificial tear supplementation and short-term use of topical steroids in severe cases. The recent approval of cyclosporine 0.1% has transformed management strategies of severe DED and moderate-to-severe OSD. Areas covered: This review summarizes existing information on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the new cyclosporine 0.1% formulation. Expert opinion: Topical cyclosporine A 0.1% represents a promising, novel medication for the management of DED, Meibomian gland dysfunction, and inflammatory OSD. It is primarily beneficial for those patients requiring topical immunomodulatory therapy. This topical formulation also has the potential to meaningfully improve the management of moderate-to-severe glaucoma therapy-related OSD. Currently there is limited published clinical data concerning the efficacy of topical cyclosporine. There are, however, theoretical advantages when comparing this cyclosporine formulation with other established commercial preparations. Future research is needed to delineate the precise role and value of this medication. "
"Abstract: Oral therapy with 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) may cause major side effects, whereas the topical treatment might not be much effective due to the low penetration induced by typical formulations. Therefore, the objectives of this work are the development and characterization of a nanoemulsion (NE) containing 8-MOP together with an ex vivo permeation study, monitored by a validated HPLC-Fluo method, to determine the amount of drug retained in viable skin (epidermis (E) and dermis (D)) and in stratum corneum (SC). The optimized conditions for NE formulation were achieved by full factorial designs (2 "
"BACKGROUND/AIMS: In order to define a label sun protection factor (SPF) of topically applied sunscreens, in vivo test methods like ISO 24444, FDA guideline, or the Australian standard are used worldwide. The basis of all these methods is provoking an erythemal skin reaction by UV irradiation to find the level of unprotected and protected minimal erythemal doses (MED). In vitro methods replacing the human skin by any kind of non-human material are still not available. Thus, offering the new hybrid diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (HDRS) technique that is able to stay on an in vivo level for SPF testing but meanwhile neglecting the UV-dose-related erythemal skin reaction is a perfect combination to take care of sun protection and any ethical concerns in SPF testing nowadays. METHODS: HDRS is a combination of in vivo diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) measurements on the skin and in vitro transmission measurements of a sunscreen on a roughened polymethylmethacrylate plate. By this technique, the in vivo behavior of the investigated sunscreen on the skin is measured as well as the UVB absorption, which is still non-visible in the reflectance technique. In order to establish an alternative method for in vivo SPF testing, a huge number of sunscreens (80 samples) was measured by HDRS and compared to the worldwide accepted standard ISO 24444. The variety of sunscreens measured reflects a wide range of different types of formulations as well as a wide range of SPFs (5-120) to validate this new alternative SPF testing procedure. RESULTS: The applied quantity of product as well as skin color dependencies of signal generation are shown to support any basic correlation of DRS signal generation and sun protection expectations. Far-reaching statistical data analyses show an excellent link of the new non-erythemally driven HDRS-SPF technique and ISO 24444 results. In the same way, HDRS-UVA-PF results can be correlated with UVA-PF values calculated from ISO 24443. CONCLUSION: Due to the elimination of any erythemal relevant UVB and UVA doses, absolutely no skin reaction occurs. Consequently there is no need to define a MED any more. For the first time an alternative way to SPF is shown without any ethical concerns of SPF testing in vivo and/or any restriction of SPF testing in vitro. Regardless of the type of formulation or the level of protection, an excellent correlation of SPFHDRS and SPF24444 for sunscreen labeling could be found. By this new alternative non-erythemal technique, not only SPF values can be measured, but also UVA-PF values can be calculated with an excellent correlation to ISO 24443 from the same set of data. For the first time a robust alternative test method of SPF- and UVA-PF values is described, taking into account the interaction of sunscreen formulation and skin. "
"BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin disease, commonly treated with topical or systemic drugs, according to the severity of the condition. Retinoids and antibiotic compounds are considered cornerstone approaches in this condition. However, low adherence to the therapy and the issue of bacterial resistance undermine the efficacy in the long term. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with 20% aminolevulinic acid (ALA) has shown to be effective in the treatment of inflammatory acne. Skin tolerability, however, could be a limiting factor for a widespread use of this approach. A new formulation of 5% ALA in thermosetting gel has been recently available. This formulation allows a more convenient application procedure without occlusion and better and more efficient release of the active compound in comparison with traditional ALA formulations like creams or ointments. STUDY AIM: To evaluate in a two-center, assessor-blinded, prospective, proof-of-concept study, the efficacy, and tolerability of red-light (630 nm) PDT with a new 5-ALA ""low-dose"" topical gel formulation (5%) in the treatment of inflammatory mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris (AV). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 35 subjects with moderate AV of the face (mean age: 24 ± 8 years, 13 men and 22 women) were enrolled, after their written informed consent. The primary outcome was the evolution of GAG (Global Acne Grade System) score at baseline and after an average of three, 630-nm, 15-minute, PDT sessions, performed every 2 weeks. GAG score was also calculated in a follow-up visit 6 months after the last PDT session. Skin tolerability was assessed during PDT sessions with a patient-reported discomfort level evaluation score from 0 (no discomfort at all) to 3 (severe discomfort). RESULTS: At baseline, the GAG score was 21 ± 6. After the last PDT session, the GAG score evaluated in a blinded fashion (digital photographs) was significantly reduced to 6.5 ± 5.7, representing a 70% reduction (P = .0001, Wilcoxon test; mean difference 14.9; 95% CI of the difference: 12.1-17.6). At the follow-up visit, the GAG score was 6.7 ± 6.8. The 5% ALA thermosetting gel Red-light PDT was in general very well tolerated with a discomfort mean level score of 0.5 ± 1. CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study supports the efficacy of 5% ALA thermosetting gel red-light PDT in inflammatory acne of the face with a relevant clinical improvement of inflammatory lesions with a very good tolerability profile. Clinical improvement was maintained in the medium term (Trial Registration Number: ISRCTN66066651). "
"Abstract: The prevalence of end-stage renal disease is increasing worldwide. The best treatment is kidney transplantation, although life-long immunosuppressive therapy is then mandatory. Currently, the cornerstone immunosuppressive therapy relies on tacrolimus (Tac), a calcineurin inhibitor that is nephrotoxic but whose exposition can be minimized in a delicate balance. Area covered: We addressed whether, in the setting of kidney transplantation, Tac-based therapy can be tailored to medical needs: to achieve this, we searched for suitable articles in PubMed. Expert commentary: Too over-minimization of Tac, when associated with mycophenolic acid (MPA), may cause the development of de novo donor-specific alloantibodies (DSA). However, Tac minimization, in the context of everolimus-associated therapy instead of MPA, does not increase DSA formation as demonstrated in the TRANSFORM study and, in addition, can prevent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation. Nonetheless, Tac therapy, regardless of its formulation (immediate or extended release) compared to cyclosporine A, increases the risk of posttransplant diabetes mellitus; this increase is not affected by steroid therapy. Tac-based immunosuppression remains the best immunosuppressive therapy in kidney-transplant recipients and can be tailored according to patients' need. "
"Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo effect of Solid Lipid Microparticles (SLM), proposed for topical ocular administration of cyclosporine, on the rabbit eye. SLM carrier is an aqueous dispersion of lipid microparticles (20% w/w) with a size up to 15 μm. Cyclosporine was dissolved in the formulation in the concentration of 0.5 or 2.0% (w/w). Ocular tolerance of microsphere dispersion was assessed in rabbit model by the Draize eye test (SLM was compared with emulsion and oily solution), and cyclosporine distribution in ocular tissues was evaluated after multiple application of tested formulations (SLM dispersions, emulsions and oily solution) for 7 days. Good tolerance of cyclosporine-SLM formulation was demonstrated in the rabbit model. Concentration of cyclosporine in the precorneal tissues, such as cornea and conjunctiva, was much higher than the therapeutic value (8.4 ng/mg and 3.2 ng/mg, respectively). After SLM administration, the cyclosporine concentrations determined in the anterior ocular tissues, were also significantly higher compared to those obtained after the application of other tested carriers (emulsions and oily solution). The obtained results prove that the recognized SLM dispersions are safe formulations for ophthalmic use. It can be concluded that lipid microparticles are highly promising for an efficient ophthalmic drug delivery, when compared to other conventional dosage forms. "
"Abstract: Cytarabine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog used predominantly for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and also for other indications, including acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and lymphoma by parenteral route due to its low oral bioavailability. Parenteral administration requires constant plasma level, monitoring for its fluctuation and poor patients compliances. Hence the objective of this work is to construct optimized nanosized malleable liposomes of cytarabine to accentuate transdermal delivery of drug to circumvent previously mentioned drawbacks. We also investigated its characteristics and therapeutic efficiency and attempted to systematically explore the penetration enhancing property. Well characterized ethanolic liposomes were also biologically tested for dermatological safety and systemic bioavailability. Ethanolic liposomes were found to be spherical having nanometric size with low polydispersity and high encapsulation efficiency. Skin permeation and deposition studies revealed significant enhancement. In vivo, skin irritation study of developed formulation showed no erythema or scaling vis-à-vis the liposomes. Blood profile of this novel formulation indicated lower lag time with the high amount of drug within 3-12 h after transdermal administration demonstrating the enhanced percutaneous penetration of cytarabine with no erythema, thus leading to patient's compliance by alternative delivery of drug for the treatment of leukemia.

"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Though Unani medications have been used for centuries to treat psoriasis, there is paucity of published studies which have systematically evaluated their efficacy and safety. This study was conducted to establish non-inferiority of Unani medications (oral UNIM-401 and topical UNIM-403) vs psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) sol in treatment of moderate-severe chronic plaque psoriasis (CPP) in achieving psoriasis area severity index (PASI) 75 at 12 wk and to estimate proportion of patients who relapsed in follow up period of 12 weeks, after having achieved PASI 50. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled trial patients with CPP were block randomized to receive either Unani treatment (147 patients) or PUVA sol (140 patients) for 12 weeks. Percentage reduction in PASI was determined in each patient at 12 wk to calculate number of patients who achieved PASI 75 as also to estimate median of percentage reduction in PASI in each group. All patients who achieved PASI 50 at 12 weeks were followed up for another 12 wk to determine proportion of patients who relapsed. RESULTS: Of the 287 patients randomized, 84 of 147 in Unani group and 67 of 140 in PUVA sol group completed 12 weeks of treatment. On intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, the response in patients on Unani medication was not inferior to those receiving PUVA sol, in attaining PASI 75 (16.3% in Unani group vs 15.7% in the PUVA sol group). Median of percentage reduction of PASI at 12 wk from baseline in Unani group (68.2%; -60, 100) and PUVA sol group (63%; -15.7, 100) was comparable. Proportion of patients who relapsed at 24 wk was comparable in both groups. However, frequency of clinical side effects was significantly higher (P =0.001) in PUVA sol group (16.4%) compared to Unani group (2%). INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study indicated that oral UNIM-401 and topical UNIM-403 were effective and well tolerated therapeutic options in patients with moderate-severe CPP.

"INTRODUCTION: Diaper dermatitis is a common condition that develops in the diaper area due to factors such as elevated moisture, increased skin surface pH, and exposure to irritants from urine and feces. These factors suggest interventions to prevent or treat diaper dermatitis such as exposing the skin to air, frequent diaper changes, and thorough cleansing of the diaper area. Barrier creams and powders also have a role in preventing and treating diaper dermatitis. We developed a cream-to-powder product with a formula based on corn starch and other natural ingredients for use in the diaper area. METHODS: Dye exclusion study: The barrier properties of the cream-to-powder product were assessed using a dye exclusion protocol. Skin color at treated and untreated forearm sites was measured at baseline and after exposure to crystal violet stain. The cream-to-powder product's ability to inhibit the water-soluble dye from reaching the skin was judged by comparing color changes at the treated and untreated sites. Tolerance-in-use study: The safety of the cream-to-powder product was assessed in a four-week tolerance-in-use study conducted in a group of 52 diaper-wearing infants and toddlers. Subjects' parents/guardians applied the cream-to-powder product at each diaper change. A pediatrician judged safety endpoints of erythema, dryness, and edema in the diaper area at baseline and at study end. Parents/guardians also completed a questionnaire at study end. These studies have complied with Good Clinical Practices (GCP/ICH). OUTCOMES: The cream-to-powder product prevented about 70% of the test dye from reaching the skin surface, demonstrating its ability to supplement the skin barrier. The tolerance-in-use study showed no statistically significant changes in any of the safety endpoints; there were no adverse events. Parents/guardians responses to the cream-to-powder product were overwhelmingly positive. Taken together, these results support that the cream-to-powder formulation is safe and effective for helping to prevent diaper dermatitis. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(5):566-570. "

"BACKGROUND: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and particularly selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors such as celecoxib (Cxb) are considered promising cancer chemopreventive for colon, breast, prostate, lung, and skin cancers. However, the clinical application to the prevention is limited by concerns about safety, potential to serious toxicity (mainly for healthy individuals), efficacy and optimal treatment regimen. Cxb exhibits advantages as potent antiinflammatory and gastrointestinal tolerance compared with conventional NSAID's. Recent researches suggest that dermatological formulations of Cxb are more suitable than oral administration in the treatment of cutaneous disease, including skin cancer. To date, optimism has been growing regarding the exploration of the topical application of Cxb (in the prevention of skin cancers and treatment of cutaneous inflammation) or transdermal route reducing risks of systemic side effects. OBJECTIVE: This paper briefly summarizes our current knowledge of the development of the cutaneous formulations or delivery systems for Cxb as anti-inflammatory drug (for topical or transdermal application) as well its chemopreventive properties focused on skin cancer. CONCLUSION: New perspectives emerge from the growing knowledge, bringing innovative techniques combining the action of Cxb with other substances or agents which act in a different way, but complementary, increasing the efficacy and minimizing toxicity.

"UNLABELLED: Podophyllotoxin (PPT) is a chemotherapeutic agent which has shown significant activity against P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated multi drug resistant cancer cells. However, because of the poor aqueous solubility and high toxicity, PPT cannot be used in clinical cancer therapy. In order to enhance the efficiency and reduce side effect of PPT, a polypeptide based PPT conjugate PLG-g-mPEG-PPT was developed and used for the treatment of multi drug resistant breast cancer. The PLG-g-mPEG-PPT was prepared by conjugating PPT to poly(l-glutamic acid)-g-methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (PLG-g-mPEG) via ester bonds. The PPT conjugates self-assembled into nanoparticles with average sizes about 100 nm in aqueous solution. Western blotting assay showed that the PLG-g-mPEG-PPT could effectively inhibit the expression of P-gp in the multiple drug resistant MCF-7/ADR cells. In vitro cytotoxicity assay indicated that the resistance index (RI) values of PLG-g-mPEG-PPT on different drug-resistant cancer cell lines exhibited 57-270 folds reduction than of traditional microtubule inhibitor chemotherapeutic drug PTX or DTX. Hemolysis assay demonstrated that the conjugation greatly decreased the hemolytic activity of free PPT. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PLG-g-mPEG-PPT increased greatly (13.3 folds) as compared to that of free PPT. In vivo study showed that the PLG-g-mPEG-PPT conjugate remarkably enhanced the antitumor efficacy against MCF-7/ADR xenograft tumors with a tumor suppression rate (TSR) of 82.5%, displayed significantly improved anticancer efficacy as compared to free PPT (TSR = 37.1%) with minimal toxicity when both of the two formulations were used in MTD. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The development of multiple drug resistance (MDR) of cancer cells is the main cause of chemotherapy failure. The over-expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) has been recognized to be the most important cause of MDR in cancer. Podophyllotoxin (PPT) is a chemotherapeutic agent which has shown strong activity against P-gp mediated multidrug resistant cancer cells by simultaneously inhibiting the over-expression of P-gp and the growth of cancer cells. However, PPT can not be used in clinical cancer treatment due to its poor aqueous solubility and high toxicity. Herein, we developed a polypeptide based PPT conjugate PLG-g-mPEG-PPT by conjugating PPT to poly(l-glutamic acid)-g-methoxy poly(ethylene glycol). The PLG-g-mPEG-PPT shows significantly decreased hemolytic activity, greatly improved maximum tolerated dose and remarkably enhanced antitumor efficacy against MCF-7/ADR xenograft tumors as compared to free PPT.

"Abstract: Fast dissolving oral film is a stamp-style, drug-loaded polymer film with rapid disintegration and dissolution. This new kind of drug delivery system requires effective taste masking technology. Suspension intermediate and liposome intermediate were prepared, respectively, for the formulation of two kinds of fast dissolving oral films with the aim of studying the effect of taste masking technology on the bioavailability of oral films. Loratadine was selected as the model drug. The surface pH of the films was close to neutral, avoiding oral mucosal irritation or side effects. The thickness of a 2 cm × 2 cm suspension oral film containing 10 mg of loratadine was 100 μm. Electron microscope analysis showed that liposomes were spherical before and after re-dissolution, and drugs with obvious bitterness could be masked by the encapsulation of liposomes. Dissolution of the two films was superior to that of the commercial tablets. Rat pharmacokinetic experiments showed that the oral bioavailability of the suspension film was significantly higher than that of the commercial tablets, and the relative bioavailability of the suspension film was 175%. Liposomal film produced a certain amount of improvement in bioavailability, but lower than that of the suspension film. "
"Abstract: The aim of present study was to design and optimize 0.1% adapalene loaded nano-emulsion to improve the drug efficacy and increase its user compliance. Effect of type and concentration of surfactants was studied on size of 0.1% adapalene loaded nano-emulsion. Optimized formulation was then evaluated for particle size, polydispersity index, morphology, viscosity, and pH. Subsequently, 1% carbopol® 934 was incorporated to the optimized formulation for preparation of its gel form. The efficacy and safety of 0.1% adapalene loaded nano-emulsion gel was assessed compared to marketed gel containing 0.1% adapalene. In-vitro studies showed that adapalene permeation through the skin was negligible in both adapalene loaded nano-emulsion gel and adapalene marketed gel. Furthermore, drug distribution studies in skin indicated higher retention of adapalene in the dermis in adapalene loaded nano-emulsion gel compared with adapalene marketed gel. Antibacterial activity against Propionibacterium acnes showed that adapalene loaded nano-emulsion is effective in reducing minimum inhibitory concentration of the formulation in comparison with tea tree oil nano-emulsion, and pure tea tree oil. In vivo skin irritation studies showed absence of irritancy for adapalene loaded nano-emulsion gel. Also, blood and liver absorption of the drug, histological analysis of liver and liver enzyme activity of rats after 90 days' treatment were investigated. No drug was detected in blood/liver which in addition to an absence of any adverse effect on liver and enzymes showed the potential of adapalene loaded nano-emulsion gel as a novel carrier for topical delivery of adapalene.

"PURPOSE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease and Notch pathway plays a pivotal role in synoviocytes involved in progression of RA. METHODS: Herein, we have designed a self-assembled polymeric micelles based on polycaprolactone-polyethylene glycol (PCL-PEG) and polyethylenimine-polyethylene glycol (PEI-PEG) was prepared and loaded with methotrexate and Notch-1 siRNA for the effective treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. RESULTS: The MTX/siRNA-loaded polymeric micelles (siM-PM) showed appreciable cellular uptake in Raw264.7 cells which were activated with LPS and did not exhibit any toxicity to Raw264.7 and HUVEC cells. The AUC of siM-PM was 4-fold higher compared to that of free MTX while t1/2 was 6 fold for siM-PM compared to that of free drug indicating the superior pharmacokinetic parameters. Importantly, siM-PM significantly reduced the paw thickness and slowed the disease progression remarkably, indicating that siM-PM is very effective in recovering the edema in arthritic animals. Importantly, 2-fold decrease in arthritic score was observed in siM-PM treated group at the end of day 24. The data clearly reveals anti-inflammatory effect of combinational nanoparticle due to the sequence specific downregulation of Notch-1 expression in the RA clinical models. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, nanomedicine-based delivery of MTX and siRNA could overcome the side effects of small molecules and could improve the therapeutic effect of siRNA in rheumatoid arthritis. "
"BACKGROUND: Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the most common cause of hair loss in men. Topical minoxidil solutions can help to treat AGA but have to be applied continuously to be effective. OBJECTIVES: A new minoxidil formulation with improved cosmetic characteristics (DC0120, Pierre-Fabre Dermatologie) was tested for noninferiority vs a comparator minoxidil product (ALOSTIL METHODS: Two 10 cm RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty subjects were included and randomized, of which 210 completed the study. The mean change in nonvellus TAHC between baseline and week 16 was +22.0 hairs/cm CONCLUSIONS: DC0120 was as safe and effective as a similar marketed minoxidil product for stimulating hair growth in men with AGA.

"Abstract: Background Mometasone furoate, one of the second generation intranasal corticosteroids, is currently used in suspension form due to its poor solubility. However, this is not favorable for nasal application because of the rapid elimination of the instilled drug from the nasal cavity by mucociliary clearance and delayed onset of action due to the slow dissolution of drug in suspension. Objective The aim of this study was to determine the antiallergic effects of mucoadhesive thermosensitive in situ gel containing mometasone furoate that we developed previously to prolong the contact between the drug and nasal mucosa and to prevent drainage of the formulation in an ovalbumin-induced rat model of allergic rhinitis. Methods An experimental allergic rhinitis model was developed in female Wistar albino rats by intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin every 2 days for 14 days followed by its repeated intranasal instillation for 7 consecutive days. Intranasal instillation of ovalbumin was continued every other day for 14 days. Mometasone furoate in situ gel (5 μg/10 µl), mometasone furoate suspension (5 μg/10 µl), and physiological saline (10 µl) were administered into the bilateral nasal cavities from day 22 to day 35. Antiallergic effects were evaluated through histopathological evaluation, analysis of ovalbumin-specific serum immunoglobulin E, and a symptom score. Results Mometasone furoate in situ gel significantly decreased the nasal symptoms and ovalbumin-specific serum immunoglobulin E level as compared with mometasone furoate suspension and physiological saline. Additionally, inflammatory histological symptoms such as mucosal edema, vascular dilatation, eosinophil infiltration, and loss of cilia within the nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitis model rats were remarkably improved with the treatment of mometasone furoate in situ gel. Conclusion These results suggest that mometasone furoate in situ gel has a better therapeutic potential for the treatment of allergic rhinitis compared to mometasone furoate suspension. "
"Abstract: Gel manicures have become a popular beauty trend in recent years. The specially formulated nail polish must undergo curing under light-based units. The majority of these curing lamps emit high-intensity ultraviolet A, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk for skin cancers. Incorporating relevant information in patient education endeavors can help them practice avoidance, apply broad-spectrum sunscreen prior, or use nitrile exam gloves in order to prevent photoaging and skin cancer resulting from these procedures.

"Abstract: The functionalized nanoparticles have been widely studied and reported as carriers of drug transport recently. Furthermore, many groups have focused more on developing novel and efficient treatment methods, such as photodynamic therapy and photothermal therapy, since both therapies have shown inspiring potential in the application of antitumor. The mentioned treatments exhibited the superiority of cooperative manner and showed the ability to compensate for the adverse effects caused by conventional monotherapy in proposed strategies. In view of the above descriptions, we formulated a thermosensitive drug delivery system, which achieved the enhanced delivery of cisplatin and two photosensitizers (ICG and Ce6) by dual-targeting traction. Drawing on the thin film hydration method, cisplatin and photosensitizers were encapsulated inside nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the targeting peptide cRGD and targeting molecule folate can be modified on the surface of nanoparticles to realize the active identification of tumor cells. The measurements of dynamic light scattering showed that the prepared nanoparticles had an ideal dispersibility and uniform particle size of 102.6 nm. On the basis of the results observed from confocal laser scanning microscope, the modified nanoparticles were more efficient endocytosed by MCF-7 cells as a contrast to SGC-7901 cells. Photothermal conversion-triggered drug release and photo-therapies produced a significant apoptosis rate of 85.9% on MCF-7 cells. The distinguished results made it believed that the formulated delivery system had conducted great efforts and innovations for the realization of concise collaboration and provided a promising strategy for the treatment of breast cancer.

"Abstract: Retinol, a derivative of vitamin A, is a ubiquitous compound used to treat acne, reduce wrinkles and protect against conditions like psoriasis and ichthyosis. While retinol is used as the primary active ingredient (AI) in many skin care formulations, its efficacy is often limited by an extreme sensitivity to degrade and toxicity at high concentrations. While microencapsulation is an appealing method to help overcome these issues, few microencapsulation strategies have made a major translational impact due to challenges with complexity, cost, limited protection of the AI and poor control of the release of the AI. We have developed a class of silicone particles that addresses these challenges for the encapsulation, protection and controlled release of retinol and other hydrophobic compounds. The particles are prepared by the sol-gel polymerization of silane monomers, which enables their rapid and facile synthesis at scale while maintaining a narrow size distribution (i.e., CV < 20%). We show that our particles can: (i) encapsulate retinol with high efficiency (>85%), (ii) protect retinol from degradation (yielding a half-life 9× greater than unencapsulated retinol) and (iii) slowly release retinol over several hours (at rates from 0.14 to 0.67 μg cm "
"OBJECTIVES: In this study, nanoparticles of curcumin were developed and orally administered to moderate-to-severe psoriasis (Psoriasis Area Severity Index values, PASI > 10) patients, in a placebo controlled, double blind, randomised clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness. METHODS: Diverse binary systems of curcumin and hydrophilic polymers were investigated to optimise solubility and stability in terms of curcumin residual content and size of the crystals. Nanocrystals of curcumin stabilised with PVP (1 : 0.5, w/w), were characterised using X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, TEM analyses and stability studies. The formulation was evaluated with a parallel artificial membrane permeability assay to predict the passive intestinal absorption. The first group of patients was treated orally with acitretin (0.4 mg/kg per day) plus nanocurcumin (3 g/day), the second group with acitretin, for 12 weeks. KEY FINDINGS: Curcumin nanoparticles were homogeneous and stable systems. Curcumin permeability was significantly enhanced when compared with aqueous saturated solution of curcumin. The reduction in PASI was significantly higher in patients treated with curcumin (P < 0.0001) and cholesterol serum levels remained unchanged in patients treated with acitretin plus nanocurcumin. CONCLUSIONS: Curcumin nanoparticles represent an effective adjuvant therapy in moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients treated with oral acitretin, improving their lipid serum profile. "
"Abstract: Nanoformulations derived from fine porous ZnO quantum dot nanoparticles (QD NPs) can offer strong potential medical applications; especially in cancer therapy. ZnO QD NPs was synthesized by sol-gel hydrothermal process, fast cold quenching and further smart surface functionalization methods to obtain ultrasmall size (1-4 nm) NPs. ZnO nanopolymer, a wetting agent, PEG co-solvent and water/oil emulsion stabilizer were considered in our nanofluid formulation. The resulting nanofluid was characterized by SEM, FTIR, photoluminescence, band gap energy, zeta potential and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The cytotoxic effects on the growth of four cancer cell lines were evaluated by MTT assay. The IC "
"BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that manifests as open and closed comedones as well as inflammatory papules, pustules, and nodules localized on face and trunk. Oral isotretinoin demonstrated to be effective in controlling seborrhea, inflammation, Propionibacterium Acnes hyperproliferation and reducing scarring, nevertheless muco-cutaneous side effects, particularly dryness, itching, bruising are commonly seen in patients under treatment with isotretinoin reducing the compliance to the treatment. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a cream compound formulated in order to reduce the oral isotretinoin side effects (redness, dryness, itching) in patients affected by severe acne of the face. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients undergoing treatment with 0.5-1 mg/kg/day for papulo-pustular or nodulo-cystic acne were randomized to additionally receive a cream composed of 8% omega-ceramides, hydrophilic sugars, 5% niacinamide applied twice daily (group A) or placebo cream (group B) applied 2 times per day. RESULTS: During the whole treatment period and after 6 months of treatment, patients in the group A showed a greater reduction of dryness, itching and redness compared to the group receiving the placebo cream. CONCLUSIONS: The cream formulated with 8% omega-ceramides, hydrophilic sugars, 5% niacinamide was effective in reducing xerosis and skin irritation, and was also successful in improving the patients' adherence to the oral isotretinoin treatment.

"BACKGROUND: The clinical efficacy of the topical tretinoin is widely studied and has been well established for many therapeutic interventions, among some, photoaging, acne, and melasma. However, the side effects, mainly cutaneous irritation, erythema, xerosis and peeling, remain major obstacle to the patient compliance. Besides, the insight regarding the drug delivery profile is essential to understand the therapeutic action of the drug. METHODS: Through bibliographic research in databases we highlight further advances and an update on tretinoin delivery systems such as liposomes, niosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, cyclodextrins, nanostructured polymers and other technological systems that reduce its side effects and improve the permeation profile to potentiate efficacy and drug safety on the skin. RESULTS: Pharmaceutical preparations were developed and evaluated for permeability in in vitro models using pig ear, snake, mouse and human skin, and potential for irritation was also verified using release systems for tretinoin and compared to available commercial formulations. Overall results indicated the composition, charge and size of the system influences the tretinoin delivery, modulating the type of release and its retention. Small unilamellar vesicles promoted greater cutaneous delivery of tretinoin. Negative charge, for both liposomes and niosomes, can improve pig skin hydration as well as the tretinoin retention. The quantity of solid lipids and the type of oil used in the composition of solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers affected percutaneous drug delivery. CONCLUSION: As evident from the literature, the tretinoin technological delivery systems consist an innovative and potential management for increasing the patient compliance presenting safety and efficacy.

"Abstract: An innovative microcarrier based on a carboxy-enriched and branched polylactic acid derivative was developed to enhance the in vitro phototoxicity of the photosensitizer and prodrug 5-aminolevulinic. Microparticles, prepared by double emulsion technique and loaded with the prodrug were carefully characterized and the effect of the polymer structure on the chemical, physical and biological properties of the final product was evaluated. Results showed that microparticles have a spherical shape and ability to allocate up to 30 μg of the photosensitizer per mg of carrier despite their difference in solubility. Release studies performed in various simulated physiological conditions demonstrate the influence of the branched structure and the presence of the additional carboxylic groups on the release rate and the possibility to modulate it. In vitro assays conducted on human epithelial adenocarcinoma cells proved the not cytotoxicity of the carriers in a wide range of concentrations. The hemocompatibility and surface proteins adsorption were evaluated at different microparticles concentrations to evaluate the safety and estimate the possible microparticles residential time in the bloodstream. The advantages, of loading 5-aminolevulinic acid in the prepared carrier has been deeply described in terms of enhanced phototoxicity, compared to the free 5-aminolevulinic acid formulation after irradiation with light at 635 nm. The obtained results demonstrate the advantages of the prepared derivative compared to the linear polylactide for future application in photodynamic therapy based on the photosensitizer 5-aminolevulinic acid.

"Abstract: The application of local anesthetics, usually administered by subcutaneous injection, is common in the course of diagnostic, therapeutic, and cosmetic dermatology procedures. The effective dermal delivery of lidocaine could offer a solution to many adverse effects caused by needle insertion, such as pain, local reactions or toxicity, and additionally, it avoids the disruption of anatomical landmarks. Therefore, novel dermal formulations of local anesthetics are needed to overcome the barrier function of the skin and provide sufficient and prolonged anesthesia. In our study, we aimed to investigate and compare the penetration profiles of four different lidocaine containing formulations (hydrogel, oleogel, lyotropic liquid crystal and nanostructured lipid carrier) by Raman microscopic mapping of the drug. The application of Raman spectroscopy provided information about the spatial distribution of lidocaine in the skin ex vivo. The penetration of lidocaine from lyotropic liquid crystal and nanostructured carrier reached deeper skin layers and a higher amount of the drug was diffused into the skin, compared with hydrogel and oleogel. This study confirmed that nanostructured carriers can improve skin penetration properties of lidocaine and proved the applicability of Raman spectroscopy in the research of dermatological preparations ex vivo as a nondestructive, relatively easy and fast technique.

"Abstract: Condyloma acuminatum (CA) is a common sexually transmitted disease caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Podophyllotoxin (POD), a cytotoxic compound, is able to effectively treat HPV; however, the severe irritation side effects of POD restrict its use as a treatment for CA. The aim of the present study was to construct novel POD‑loaded nanostructured nanolipid carriers (POD‑NLCs) and evaluate their physicochemical characteristics and cytotoxicity. POD‑NLCs (0.5%) were prepared using emulsion‑evaporation and low temperature‑solidification methods with optimized conditions and preparations. Subsequently, the POD‑NLCs were physicochemically characterized and their in vitro and in vivo release efficiencies and in vitro cytotoxicity were studied. The prepared POD‑NLCs had an average particle size, ζ potential, polydispersity index and encapsulation efficacy of 178.5±20 nm, ‑27±0.5 mV, 0.18±0.01 and 82.9±2%, respectively. In vitro and in vivo release studies demonstrated that POD‑NLCs are able to provide sustained drug delivery for 72 h in vitro and 10 h in the mucosa. Compared with a tincture formulation of POD (POD‑T), POD‑NLC induced less inflammatory cytokine production in the cervical mucous and led to a decreased histopathological score. In addition, a cytotoxicity assay demonstrated that inhibition of the POD‑NLCs was 98.4% at 24 h and remained >98% up to 72 h. Furthermore, more cells were arrested in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle following POD‑NLC treatment compared with the POD‑T treatment. The present study provides evidence that POD‑NLC is a promising delivery system for the treatment of CA. "
"Abstract: Bisphosphonate-induced osteonecrosis of the jaw [BIONJ] is a relatively new pathological condition which was first described in the year 2003. The prevalence of BIONJ in patients on oral formulations is around 0.05% within the first 3 years and increases up to 0.2% after 4 years of consumption. Proven systemic risk factors like anemia, uncontrolled diabetes, corticosteroid therapy, and chemotherapy in neoplastic diseases [e.g., high doses of methotrexate up to 30 mg daily] significantly increase the chances of acquiring BIONJ. We present three patients with osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis [RA] who consumed oral bisphosphonates [alendronate] for less than 1 year and developed BIONJ within 2 to 5 months of undergoing a traumatic dental procedure. The patients also gave a history of consuming low doses of methotrexate [disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs] up to 20 mg weekly for 4 to 10 years. No history of steroid consumption was given by any of the patients. This case series highlights the possibility of rheumatoid arthritis and low-dose methotrexate being potential risk factors for BIONJ. This may be on account of the synergistic effect of methotrexate and bisphosphonates and the pro-inflammatory state created by RA which increased the risk of acquiring BIONJ. "
"Abstract: The goal of the current study was to explore the potential benefits of Acitretin (Act) nanovesicular gel as a prospective antipsoriatic topical delivery system counteracting the drug challenges in terms of its extremely low aqueous solubility, instability, skin irritation, and serious systemic adverse effects. Act-loaded niosomes were successfully developed, entirely characterized, and optimized. Further evaluation of the optimized formula was conducted regarding its stability and ex vivo cytotoxicity on different cell lines. The optimized niosomal vesicles were then incorporated in gel base matrix and investigated by sequential ex vivo (skin permeation and deposition) and in vivo (skin irritation and antipsoriatic activity using mouse tail model) experiments. The optimized Act-loaded niosomes (span 60:cholesterol molar ratio 1:1) were spherical in shape and exhibited the highest entrapment efficiency (90.32±3.80%) with appropriate nanosize and zeta potential of 369.73±45.45 nm and -36.33±1.80 mV, respectively. Encapsulation of the drug in the nanovesicles was further emphasized by differential scanning calorimetric and powder X-ray diffraction studies. After 3 months storage at 4±1°C, the optimized formula preserved its stability. Act nano niosomal gel produced a remarkable enhanced ex vivo permeation profile up to 30 h and significant drug deposition in the viable epidermal-dermal layers compared with those of Act gel. The pronounced antipsoriatic activity of the medicated nano niosomes was proved ex vivo in HaCaT cells (a keratinocyte cell line). Topical application of Act nano niosomal gel to mouse tail model further established its distinct in vivo antipsoriatic superiority in terms of significantly higher orthokeratosis, drug activity, and reduction in epidermal thickness compared with the control and other gel formulations. Also, negligible skin irritation and better skin tolerability of Act nanovesicular gel were revealed by primary irritation index and histopathologic examination. "
"Abstract: Multiple sclerosis treatment faces tremendous changes owing to the approval of new medications, some of which are available as oral formulations. Until now, the four orally available medications, fingolimod, dimethylfumarate (BG-12), teriflunomide, and cladribine have received market authorization, whereas laquinimod is still under development. Fingolimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate inhibitor, which is typically used as escalation therapy and leads to up to 60% reduction of the annualized relapse rate, but might also have neuroprotective properties. In addition, there are three more specific S1P agonists in late stages of development: siponimod, ponesimod, and ozanimod. Dimethylfumarate has immunomodulatory and cytoprotective functions and is used as baseline therapy. Teriflunomide, the active metabolite of the rheumatoid arthritis medication leflunomide, targets the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, thus inhibiting the proliferation of lymphocytes by depletion of pyrimidines. Here we will review the mechanisms of action, clinical trial data, as well as data about safety and tolerability of the compounds. "
"BACKGROUND: Functional respiratory imaging (FRI) uses three-dimensional models of human lungs and computational fluid dynamics to simulate functional changes within airways and predict the deposition of inhaled drugs. This study used FRI to model the effects of different patient inhalation and drug formulation factors on lung deposition of an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β METHODS: Three-dimensional models of the lungs of six patients with asthma (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s, 83%), treated with an ICS/LABA, were included. FRI modelling was used to simulate (1) the effects on lung deposition of inhalation duration and particle size [fine particle fraction (FPF), proportion of particles <5 µm; and mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD), average size of inhalable particles]; (2) deposition of fluticasone propionate/formoterol (FP/FORM) 125/5 µg; and (3) how inhalation profiles and flow rates affected FP/FORM deposition. RESULTS: Total lung depositions (TLDs) following 1-, 3- and 5-s inhalations were 22.8%, 36.1% and 41.6% (metered dose), respectively, and central-to-peripheral deposition (C:P) ratios were 1.81, 0.86 and 0.61, respectively. TLD increased with increasing FPF, from ~8% at 10% FPF to ~36% at 40% FPF (metered dose); by contrast, MMAD had little effect on TLD, which was similar across MMADs (1.5-4.5 µm) at each FPF. FP/FORM deposited throughout central and peripheral airways with gradual (sinusoidal) and sharp (rapid) inhalations. TLD ranged from 35.8 to 44.0% (metered dose) for gradual and sharp inhalations at 30 and 60 L/min mean flow rates. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide important insights into the potential effects of inhalation characteristics (inhalation profile and duration) and aerosol formulation (FPF) on lung deposition of inhaled therapies. FRI thus represents a useful alternative to scintigraphy techniques. Future FRI studies will further our understanding of the deposition of inhaled drugs and help improve the management of asthma. "
"Abstract: Pain involves responses in which both peripheral and central mechanisms contribute to the generation of pain. Pre-clinical laboratory data have supported that a topical formulation of combined diclofenac and methadone (Diclometh) may alleviate local pain, and potentially, the side effect profile should be low. We hypothesized that antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effects of Diclometh could be demonstrated in a human experimental pain model and that Diclometh would be safe to administer. Thus, the aims were as follows: (i) to compare two doses of Diclometh versus placebo; and (ii) to assess the safety profile of Diclometh. The study was a crossover, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of two doses of Diclometh gel (0.1% and 0.2%) administered topically in healthy participants. Nerve growth factor (NGF) and capsaicin intradermal injections were used as human pain models. Pressure stimulation, contact heat stimulation, hyperalgesia (pinprick stimulation) and allodynia (brush stimulation) to mechanical stimulation were performed in the area where capsaicin and NGF were injected. Side effects were recorded on a four-point Likert scale. Twenty-one men completed the study (mean age 26.14 ± 5.3). Diclometh 0.2% reduced the capsaicin-induced dynamic mechanical allodynia compared to placebo (primary end-point, p = 0.03). No other primary or secondary end-points were found significantly different (all p > 0.05). All side effects were reported as mild with no differences between treatments (p = 0.15). Indication of antiallodynic effect of Diclometh 0.2% was found. Additionally, it was demonstrated that Diclometh was safe to use. "
"Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of major neurocognitive disorders worldwide. Despite all research efforts, therapeutic options for AD are still limited to two drug classes: cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and the NMDA-receptor antagonist memantine. Donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine are the three ChEIs FDA-approved as first-line treatment for AD. Although they share the same mode of action, they differ in terms of their pharmacologic characteristics and route of administration, which can impact their safety and tolerability profile. Rivastigmine, available in both oral and transdermal patch formulations, is a slowly reversible dual inhibitor of acetyl and butyryl cholinesterase, selective for the G1 isoform of acetylcholinesterase, without hepatic metabolism by the CYP-450 system. Despite its unique features, it has been associated with a higher incidence of adverse events in comparison to other ChEIs. The oral form, approved for the treatment of mild to moderate AD, is associated with a higher incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. The transdermal patch formulation approved for use across all stages of AD has been shown to have a better tolerability profile in comparison to both the oral form and even other ChEIs. One important tolerability concern is adverse dermatologic reactions, which are mostly benign, and can be either preventable or manageable. One important safety concern is the risk of treatment overdose by administering multiple patches at the same time, potentially leading to fatal outcomes. This can be prevented by educating patients and caregivers about the proper use of the patch. The goal for the future would be to optimize the patch formulation to increase both efficacy and safety. "
"BACKGROUND: The safety of a novel intranasal formulation of azelastine hydrochloride (AZE) and fluticasone propionate (FP) has been established in adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis but not in children <12 years old. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of an intranasal formulation of AZE and FP in children ages 4-11 years with allergic rhinitis. METHODS: The study was a randomized, 3-month, parallel-group, open-label design. Qualified patients were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to AZE/FP (n = 304) or fluticasone propionate (FP) (n = 101), one spray per nostril twice daily, and to one of three age groups: ≥4 to <6 years, ≥6 to <9 years, and ≥9 to <12 years. Safety was assessed by child- or caregiver-reported adverse events, nasal examinations, vital signs, and laboratory assessments. RESULTS: The incidence of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) was low in both the AZE/FP (16%) and FP-only (12%) groups after 90 days' continuous use. Epistaxis was the most frequently reported TRAE in both groups (AZE/FP, 9%; FP, 9%), followed by headache (AZE/FP, 3%; FP, 1%). All other TRAEs in the AZE/FP group were reported by ≤1% of the children. The majority of TRAEs were of mild intensity and resolved spontaneously. Results of nasal examinations showed an improvement over time in both groups, with no cases of mucosal ulceration or nasal septal perforation. There were no unusual or unexpected changes in laboratory parameters or vital signs. CONCLUSION: The intranasal formulation of AZE and FP was safe and well tolerated after 3 months' continuous use in children with allergic rhinitis.The study was registered on <ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" ext-link-type=""uri"" xlink:href=""http://ClinicalTrials.gov"">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT01794741).

"Abstract: Hyperleukocytosis occurs in 15-20% of all newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia patients and requires emergent treatment with leukapheresis or hydroxyurea when accompanied by signs or symptoms of leukostasis. Currently, there is no standardized hydroxyurea dosing strategy, although usual dosing ranges from 50 to 150 mg/kg/day, and prescribing patterns vary significantly among oncologists and institutions. In addition to other hematologic and dermatologic toxicities, the use of hydroxyurea may be associated with significant mucositis and mucositis-related pain. The purpose of this study was to compare mucositis-related pain between two different hydroxyurea dosing strategies in patients who received hydroxyurea for cytoreduction during induction. A retrospective chart review of adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated with chemotherapy at UNC Medical Center from April 2014 to April 2016 who received at least one dose of hydroxyurea for cytoreduction was conducted. This study compared the safety and toxicity profiles of hydroxyurea in patients who received high-dose hydroxyurea (≥75 mg/kg/day) versus low-dose hydroxyurea (<75 mg/kg/day). Safety and toxicity were evaluated based on indicators of mucositis and cumulative intravenous narcotic requirements following induction chemotherapy. Data collection included baseline demographics, mucositis risk factors, baseline laboratory values, hydroxyurea dosing, mucositis indicators, and pain indicators. A total of 55 patients were included in the study, 21 patients (38.2%) received the high-dose hydroxyurea dosing strategy. The high-dose hydroxyurea dosing strategy had a significantly higher white blood cell count at diagnosis, increased duration of hydroxyurea, and received a higher cumulative dose of hydroxyurea. Additionally, the high-dose hydroxyurea dosing strategy patients were associated with significantly more grade 3 or 4 mucositis requiring a formulation change (0% versus 28.6%, p = 0.002) and significantly higher cumulative intravenous narcotic requirements during induction (p = 0.019). No significant differences in baseline demographics or mucositis risk factors between dosing strategies were identified. The high-dose hydroxyurea dosing strategy patients had a significant increase in cumulative intravenous narcotic requirements and formulation changes, both common interventions made for the treatment of mucositis. Additional studies are needed to further elucidate the safety and toxicity profiles of hydroxyurea dosing strategies and to explore the correlation between total cumulative hydroxyurea dose and total cumulative narcotic requirements.

"Abstract: Actinic keratosis (AK) is a premalignant epithelial disease that develops on skin chronically exposed to ultraviolet-light. For outdoor workers, AK is an occupational hazard with a potential for malignant transformation into squamous cell carcinoma. Various topical treatments are used to treat AK's. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) promises the highest cure rates. We performed a prospective single center trial evaluating effects of PDT treatment for field cancerization due to occupational exposure to ultraviolet light irradiation in patients unresponsive to the treatment regimen with topical diclofenac gel. For PDT, a nanoemulsified 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) formulation was combined with narrow band red light irradiation with a peak wavelength of 635 nm and a total light intensity of 37 J/cm2. Clearance rate and adverse events were recorded. Thirty patients with a mean age of 77±10.5 years (26 males and 4 females) were included in the trial. They received between one and nine PDT sessions. Mean pain during PDT was scored at 6.8±2.8 using the visual analogue scale. Patients exhibited a mild immediate erythema after PDT. Among the patients, who tolerated PDT, a complete clearance was achieved in 93.3%, and >90% clearance - in 6.7%. Pain management was performed by cold-air analgesia. In conclusion, PDT with nanoemulsified 5-ALA and narrow band red light irradiation is an effective and safe treatment for occupational field cancerization without systemic toxicity. Adherence to this treatment is much better than to topical treatment. "
"Abstract: In this study, Compritol ATO-based Resveratrol colloidal carriers (CCCs) were prepared and subjected to characterization and evaluation. In most formulae, the use of a binary-mixture of surfactants improved the physicochemical properties. CCC6 (containing P407/P188 as bi-surfactants) attained the highest drug loading, release efficiency during 24 h and occlusive effect for 48 h; in addition, it showed a uniform particle size distribution within the desired range. In-vivo studies were done based on the analysis of anti-oxidant markers [catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)], anti-inflammatory markers [interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and rat Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)] and anti-wrinkling markers [matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-1) and Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)], after UVB-irradiation. Results were significantly different when comparing the positive control and the negative control groups (p < 0.05). Rats pre-treated with CCC6 showed a great amelioration, and the level of the biochemical markers was significantly different compared to those of the positive control group and those pre-treated with the drug suspension (p < 0.05). Also, the high skin protective effect of CCC6 was proved by visual and histopathological examination of the rats' skin. Therefore, the current study proves the beneficial effects of the designed dermal Resveratrol-loaded colloidal system. "
"OBJECTIVE: The current work was attempted to formulate and evaluate the topical sustained release delivery systems called cubosomes containing Tretinoin for the acne treatment. The recent patents on various formulations of tretinoin (EP0408370A2) helped in selecting a new formulation and evaluation. METHODS: Tretinoin loaded cubosomes were prepared by bottom-up technique, using varying the concentration of lipid and surfactant and keeping the drug concentration constant, a total of nine formulations of tretinoin was developed. These preparations were evaluated for surface charge, particle size, particle morphology, encapsulation efficiency, in-vivo and in-vitro release studies of gel enriched with cubosome dispersion. Finally, the stability studies of cubosomal gel were performed on optimized formulations. RESULTS: Significant result were obtained with tretinoin formulation as the drug is lipophilic, so it gives more depot effect on the epidermis and good retention property. The data obtained from the formulations showed that formulation TCF-5 was the optimized formulation which exhibited better drug release and entrapment efficiency. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that cubosomes offer benefits of quick onset as well as the maximal release of drug with fewer side effects. Thus, cubosomes represent a capable transporter having the property to sustain the release of drug, potential to localize the drug in the skin with a possible clinical application for acne vulgaris treatment due to cubosome depot effect on the epidermis.

"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of a complete skin care line consisting of an oral supplement in two distinct formulations for males and females, and a topical cream device in the treatment of mild and moderate acne. Oral supplements contain biotin, probiotic, vitamin E, zinc, nicotinamide; in the formulation for males beta sitosterol and Boswellia serrata were added, the oral supplement for females contains myo-inositol and folic acid. The topical cream device is represented by the association between active plant agents (verbascoside, Ocimum gratissimum) and keratolytic molecules (salicylic acid, gluconolactone, complex alpha-hydroxy acids). METHODS: An equal number of male and female patients with mild to moderate acne were enrolled in a double-blinded clinical trial. Efficacy and tolerability evaluations were performed at week 4 (T1) and week 12 (T2) by Global acne Grading System (GAGs). RESULTS: Most of patients had satisfactory therapeutic response, in terms of GAGs reduction. All the four groups presented a statistically significant improvement of the mean GAGs at T2 but those assuming the oral supplement improved more, as expected. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that this association can be considered a new effective option for mild and moderate acne. This therapeutic line differs from others in the gender matched oral treatment. "
"Abstract: Derivatives of hydrocortisone, such as mometasone furoate, a (2') furoate-17 ester with chlorine substitutions at positions 9 and 21, have been designed to improve efficacy and reduce the incidence of adverse effects. An extensive literature search of MEDLINE, Embase and other databases was conducted to review the safety and efficacy of various formulations of topical mometasone furoate. Mometasone furoate exhibits high potency with greater anti-inflammatory activity and a longer duration of action than betamethasone. In clinical trials, mometasone furoate shows comparable or significantly better efficacy, depending on the comparator, in all indications studied in both adults and children. It is well tolerated with only transient, mild to moderate local adverse effects. It is characterised by low systemic availability due to its high lipophilicity, low percutaneous absorption and rapid hepatic biotransformation, and consequently has no significant effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The molecular biotransformation of mometasone furoate in the skin results in a lower affinity with dermal cells than epidermal cells, which contributes to its low atrophogenicity. Sensitisation to mometasone furoate is low. Overall, mometasone furoate is a highly efficacious potent corticosteroid with a low risk of both local and systemic adverse effects. "
"AIMS: Intravenous high-dose free methylprednisolone (MP) hemisuccinate is the primary treatment for an acute relapse in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. However, it is inconvenient and its side effects are undesirable. Both dose and dosing frequency can be reduced by incorporating free MP in glutathione-PEGylated liposomes, creating a slow-release formulation with reduced toxicity and prolonged peripheral efficacy. This first-in-human study was designed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of glutathione-PEGylated liposomes containing MP (2B3-201). METHODS: The first part was a double-blind, three-way cross over study in 18 healthy male subjects, receiving ascending doses of 2B3-201, active comparator (free MP) or placebo. Part 2 of the study was an open-label infusion of 2B3-201 (different doses), exploring pretreatment with antihistamines and different infusion schedules in another 18 healthy male subjects, and a cross-over study in six healthy female subjects. MP plasma concentrations, lymphocyte counts, adrenocorticotropic hormone, osteocalcin and fasting glucose were determined. Safety and tolerability profiles were assessed based on adverse events, safety measurements and central nervous system tests. RESULTS: The most frequent recorded AE related to 2B3-201 was an infusion related reaction (89%). 2B3-201 was shown to have a plasma half-life between 24 and 37 h and caused a prolonged decrease in the lymphocyte count, adrenocorticotropic hormone and osteocalcin, and a rise in fasting glucose. CONCLUSION: 2B3-201 is considered safe, with no clinically relevant changes in central nervous system safety parameters and no serious adverse events. In addition, 2B3-201 shows a long plasma half-life and prolonged immunosuppressive effects. "
"INTRODUCTION: Cutaneous hyperchromias are disorders of skin pigmentation involving increased melanin production and its irregular accumulation in skin cells. The use of sunscreens is fundamental for the control of hyperchromias by reducing the stimulation of pigmentation, as melanin synthesis is mainly stimulated by solar radiation. Many studies have demonstrated that visible light can induce significant skin damage. Considering the effects of visible light, effective photoprotection should not be limited only to UV protection but should also involve visible and infrared protection. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of UV-VIS sunscreens in protecting skin against damages caused by solar radiation and the influence of visible light on the appearance of cutaneous hyperchromias. METHODS: Forty volunteers aged 18 to 39 years with skin hyperpigmentation participated in the study. To evaluate the efficacy of the formulations developed, the percentage of hyperpigmented area was evaluated using high-resolution images-Visioface RESULTS: The developed formulations were effective in the reduction in melanin index, epidermal pigmentation, and percentage of hyperpigmented area. CONCLUSION: Finally, this study discusses how the combination of UV filters and pigments can protect the skin from solar radiation and reduces skin hyperpigmentations. "

"UNLABELLED: Nd:YAG laser has been used extensively for its versatility in treating many common aesthetic problems, but numerous adverse effects are often complained by recipients of Nd:YAG laser. This study introduces the ANT1 soybean extract cream, which was formulated to alleviate adverse effects after laser therapy. This study explores whether ANT1 enhances the repair mechanism of the postlaser skin, decreases laser-induced complication, and shortens recovery time. The study also aims to pinpoint the ANT1 concentration that is most effective in improving the skin condition after Nd-YAG laser therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients eligible for the study were Asian women, aged 25 to 40 years, who were free of dermatological diseases and allergic reaction. There were a total of 45 subjects. Each subject received a session of Nd-YAG laser therapy every 2 weeks, totaling 3 sessions. Facial skin assessment was achieved via VISIA complexion analysis. VISIA complexion analysis quantitatively assessed the skin condition and tracked the recovery progress of each subject at baseline, immediately after all 3 laser sessions, and a week after the final laser treatment. RESULTS: Skin condition was evaluated by VISIA complexion analysis. Skin condition was recorded in aspects of pigmented spots, wrinkles, texture, pores, and red area. After Nd-YAG laser therapy, postlaser inflammation was observed in all subjects. Throughout the laser sessions and the outpatient follow-up clinic, the adverse effects of laser therapy, such as redness, spots, wrinkles, pores, and textures, decreased with the use of ANT1 cream. There has been a marked effect in wrinkle reduction in the patients who received a higher concentration of ANT1 cream (P ≤ 0.05). Statistically significant improvement in spots and pores is also seen (P ≤ 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Through this study, the results suggest that the application of ANT1 soybean extract cream ameliorates the complications and enhances the cosmetic effects of Nd-YAG laser therapy. A higher concentration of the ANT1 cream significantly reduces wrinkles and redness after laser. All in all, this study proves that the ANT1 soy extract cream may be a useful addition to postlaser care for an overall enhancement in skin condition and recovery. "
"Abstract: Beta carotene (βC) loaded nanoparticles of zein (βC-NPs) were developed using modified phase separation technique. βC-NPs were prepared using different zein concentration and optimized formulation was selected on the basis of micromeritics properties and entrapment efficiency. Further, βC-NPs were evaluated for in vitro release, in vitro cell-survival, cellular localization and apoptosis induced in MCF-7 cells. The combined effect of the βC and its nanoparticulate counterpart with MTX was evaluated thereafter for cytotoxicity and apoptotic activity in MCF-7 cells. In comparison to free βC, the βC-NPs demonstrated noteworthy improvement in various biopharmaceutical attributes viz C "
"Abstract: Prevention of the flares is a main goal in the long-term treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). Therefore we investigated the efficacy of a water-in-oil emollient, containing licochalcone A, omega-6-fatty acids, ceramide 3 and glycerol, for prevention of the flares in adults with mild to moderately severe AD, treated with topical steroids, that led to clearing of the inflammatory lesions and had been discontinued prior to inclusion. The study was a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled, left-right comparison test with the number of relapses, defined as re-occurrence of erythema for at least 3 consecutive days, considered the primary outcome. Compared with the vehicle, the active formulation significantly reduced the number of relapses and maintained the barrier homeostasis of the respective arm. To the best of knowledge, this is the first study to show prevention of the AD flares by the use of stand-alone emollient treatment, based on comparison with the corresponding vehicle while excluding concomitant/rescue medications.

"Abstract: Itch is frequently associated with dermatoses characterized by a defective skin barrier. We formulated an itch-relieving moisturizing cream containing 3% menthol and ceramides. Our aim was to evaluate the safety and antipruritic efficacy of application of this cream in volunteers with and without skin diseases. Volunteers were asked to apply the cream for 1 month on a minimum body surface area of 6%. Safety was assessed by the absence of contact dermatitis or other side effects, using a self-administered questionnaire completed at 5 minutes, 1 week, and 1 month after application. To determine efficacy, volunteers with pruritic dermatoses were asked to grade their average itch intensity at baseline, 1 week, and 1 month after application. Sixty volunteers were recruited, of whom 41 had no skin disease; no adverse events were reported in the latter. Of the 19 volunteers with dermatoses, 18 reportedly had atopic dermatitis. One of the 60 volunteers stopped application due to stinging sensations induced by menthol. Itch scores of volunteers with dermatitis improved from baseline at 1 week ( "
"Abstract: The use of polymeric carriers to deliver hydrophobic photosensitizers has been widely discussed as a way to improve both fluorescence diagnostic and photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancers; however, the photophysical and pharmacokinetic parameters, as well as the PDT activity, of such modifications have, until now, only been poorly investigated. The purpose of the present study was to explore the efficacy of PDT with the formulation of the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) in combination with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) in comparison with Ce6 alone and with the clinical drug, Photodithazine in a mouse tumor model. We also investigated the photoactivity of the Ce6-PVA in a model reaction of tryptophan oxidation, analyzed the polymer-Ce6 interaction using fluorescence spectroscopy and atomic-force microscopy, and tested the phototoxicity in vitro. Using fluorescence imaging in vivo we found that injection to mice of Ce6 in a formulation with PVA resulted in a higher tumor-to-normal ratio and greater photobleaching when compared with either the use of Ce6 alone, or with the effects of Photodithazine. Tumor growth study and histological examination of CT26 tumors revealed fast, reproducible tumor regression and more advanced necrosis after PDT with Ce6-PVA. The higher photoactivity of the Ce6-PVA complex was confirmed in a model reaction of tryptophan oxidation and in cultured cells. Therefore, encapsulation of Ce6 in PVA represents a promising strategy for further increasing the selectivity and efficacy of PDT. "
"Abstract: Drug delivery systems that target the pilosebaceous unit (PSU) selectively could improve the clinical management of diseases that originate in the hair follicle. The aims of this study were (i) to prepare polymeric micelles using d-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate diblock copolymer that incorporated adapalene (ADA), a retinoid indicated for Acne vulgaris, and (ii) to investigate the feasibility of delivering ADA preferentially to the PSU under finite dose conditions - thereby better approximating actual conditions of use by patients. Incorporation of ADA into spherical micelles (d "

"Abstract: In the current study, retinoic acid (RA) was conjugated to Pluronic F127 (PF127) through an esterification process. Mixed micelles were formed with tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 (TPGS) for co-delivery of paclitaxel (PTX) and RA to the cancer cells. Mixed micelles of RA-PF127 and TPGS in different weight ratios (10:0, 7:3, 5:5, 3:7, 0:10 w/w) were prepared and physicochemical properties including, particle size, zeta potential, critical micelle concentration (CMC), drug loading content, entrapment efficiency, drug release, cellular uptake and in vitro cytotoxicity, were investigated in details. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics of PTX-loaded optimized mixed micelles were evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats and compared with Stragen "
"Abstract: Moisturizer is a major component of basic daily skin care, particularly in presence of epidermal barrier alteration and reduced epidermal water content. It is an important part of a dermatologist's strategy to maintain skin health as well as treating various dermatoses which co-exist with skin dryness and are linked to impaired skin barrier function, such as in atopic disorders as well as other types of dermatitis. Mastering the knowledge regarding mechanism of action, application, dosage, adverse effects as well as specific clinical usage of moisturizers is a must for a dermatologist in order to support their use, particularly for evidence-based, therapeutic purposes. This review discusses the use of moisturizer both for skin health maintenance as well as a definitive or adjuvant therapy for many kinds of dermatitis. "
"BACKGROUND: Ethosomes, a novel type of percutaneous drug delivery carrier with a lipid bilayer structure, penetrate the skin barrier due to their deformability and malleability, and presence of ethanol that fluidizes lipids in the skin. In order to further enhance the delivery of drugs through the skin, penetration enhancers are widely used. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to develop an optimized formulation of lornoxicam ethosomal gels, investigate skin permeability with the addition of penetration enhancers, and evaluate the invivo pharmacodynamics of these formulations. METHODS: Lornoxicam ethosomes were prepared by the ethanol injection method and optimized using the orthogonal design method. Lornoxicam ethosomal gels with enhancers were prepared and optimized using in-vitro transdermal delivery experiments. Experiments on lornoxicam ethosomal gels containing various enhancers such as azone, menthol, lauryl alcohol, and oleic acid were conducted using vertical Franz diffusion cells to measure the percutaneous permeability of the different formulations. Furthermore, the in-vivo analgesic effects of the optimized lornoxicam ethosomal gels were examined using the hot-plate and acetic acid-induced writhing tests. Anti-inflammatory activity was investigated using the dimethylbenzene-induced mouse ear swelling method. RESULTS: The results showed that compared to other formulations, the optimized lornoxicam ethosomal gels with 5 % menthol significantly increased transdermal penetration. Meanwhile, the optimized lornoxicam ethosomal gels showed remarkably anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory activity compared with the plain lornoxicam gels. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the optimized ethosomal gel formulated in this study is a promising lornoxicam carrier in transdermal delivery systems to enhance anti-nociceptive and antiinflammatory efficiency. "
"Abstract: Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder affecting children and adults, with the majority presenting mild to moderate disease severity. The use of topical corticosteroids (TCSs) in combination with emollients has been the mainstay for treating mild to moderate atopic dermatitis since the 1950s, and as a supplement to systemic treatment in severe disease. However, while very effective, TCSs are often accompanied by poor adherence due to corticophobia (fear of using corticosteroids in patients or doctors), unwanted side effects, and in some cases insufficient clinical response. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) are able to inhibit the activation of T-lymphocytes and thereby diminish inflammation. In some patients the use of TCIs has been limited due to a localized burning sensation on the first days of treatment, and also due to fear of other adverse effects. Consequently, there has been a need for the development of new topical products for atopic dermatitis. Novel topical therapies are in the pipeline and comprise both new doses and formulations of well-known pharmaceutical molecules and novel approaches targeting unique inflammatory pathways and mechanisms of disease, with a promise of higher efficacy and less harmful side effects. We review topical drugs in the pipeline for atopic dermatitis, and focus on those available in the clinicaltrials.gov database with a first received date from January 1, 2014 to May 31, 2017. "
"Abstract: Acne vulgaris is a chronic disease of the pilosebaceous units presenting as inflammatory or noninflammatory lesions in individuals of all ages. The current standard of treatment includes topical formulations in the forms of washes, gels, lotions, and creams such as antibiotics, antibacterial agents, retinoids, and comedolytics. Additionally, systemic treatments are available for more severe or resistant forms of acne. Nevertheless, these treatments have shown to induce a wide array of adverse effects, including dryness, peeling, erythema, and even fetal defects and embolic events. Zinc is a promising alternative to other acne treatments owing to its low cost, efficacy, and lack of systemic side effects. In this literature review, we evaluate the effectiveness and side-effect profiles of various formulations of zinc used to treat acne. "
"BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a very common chronic inflammatory and eczematous skin condition characterized by flares and remissions. Skin barrier alteration or dysfunction is the most relevant patogenetic factor. Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay treatment of AD, especially during flare periods. The daily use of emollients and moisturizers is also considered a relevant adjunctive strategy to improve skin barrier function and skin appearance in AD patients. Long-term use of topical corticosteroids is associated with important drawbacks and side effects. A corticosteroid-free cream containing starch, glycyrretinic acid, zinc oxide and bisabolol (Dermamid™; Difa Cooper, Caronno Pertusella, Varese, Italy) has been designed for the treatment of acute eczematous conditions like diaper dermatitis. However, this formulation could be particularly suitable also for AD. We evaluated in a three-center, assessor-blinded prospective 6-week treatment trial the efficacy and tolerability of this cream in children with chronic mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. METHODS: A total of 30 children (mean age 5 years, 18 males and 12 females) with chronic mild to moderate AD, affecting face, lower and upper limbs or trunk, were enrolled after parents' written informed consent. Exclusion criteria were a condition of immunosuppression, acute flares or a positive history of allergy to one of the components of the cream. The primary outcome was the evolution total eczema severity score (TESS) calculated as the sum of the single eczema severity score for each body area involved. Single area Eczema Severity Score (ESS) was calculated assessing eczema, infiltration, lichenification and scraching lesions using a 4-point scale grade (with 0=no sign, and 4=severe sign). A secondary endpoint was the percentage of subjects reaching at least 50% of TESS reduction at week 6 in comparison with baseline. The TESS was evaluated at baseline and after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment (twice daily application) in an assessor-blind fashion. RESULTS: At baseline the mean (SD) TESS was 11.6 (4.7). TESS was reduced significantly (P=0.0001) to 5.7 (3) after 3 weeks (-51%), and to 3.0 (2.3) at week 6 (-74%). Similar reductions were observed for single area ESS values. The percentage of subjects with at least a >50% reduction of TESS value at the end of the study was 87%. The product was very well tolerated. Only for one patient a mild burning sensation at the application site was reported. All the subjects concluded the trial. CONCLUSIONS: This trial supports the efficacy and the tolerability of a corticosteroid-free cream containing starch, glycyrretinic acid and bisabolol in the treatment of chronic mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in children.

"Abstract: All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) exhibits potent cytotoxicities against different cancer cells by binding to retinoic acid receptors (RARs), which is regarded as the first example of targeted therapy in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, its extensive clinical applications have been limited because of poor aqueous solubility, short half-life time and side effects. In this report, dimeric ATRA phosphorylcholine prodrug (Di-ATRA-PC) was designed and assembled into nanoliposomes to improve its pharmacokinetic properties. Di-ATRA-PC prodrug was synthesized by a facile esterification and characterized by mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). The Di-ATRA-PC assembled liposomes were prepared by thin film hydration method with ATRA loading efficiency up to 73wt%. The liposomes have a uniform particle size (73.1±3.6nm) with negatively charged surface (-20.5±2.5mV) and typical lipid bilayer structure as measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and cryogenic transmission electron microscope (cryo-TEM). In vitro drug release study confirmed that Di-ATRA-PC liposomes could sustainedly release free ATRA in a weakly acidic condition. Furthermore, cellular uptake, MTT and cell apoptosis analysis demonstrated that the liposomes could be successfully internalized into tumor cells to induce apoptosis of MCF-7 and HL-60 cells. More importantly, in vivo pharmacokinetic assay indicated that Di-ATRA-PC liposomes had much longer retention time in comparison with ATRA. In conclusion, Di-ATRA-PC liposomal formulation could be a potential drug delivery system of ATRA with enhanced pharmacokinetic properties. "
"UNLABELLED: Background The use of ALA to identify the parathyroid glands had been investigated both experimentally and clinically with promising results but the side effects from the systemic use of this photosensitizer reduce its widespread in clinical use. The aim of this study is to test the formulation of ALA in nano-stealth liposomes for better photodiagnosis of parathyroid glands intraoperatively with less ALA dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preparation of ALA nanovesicles and in vitro characterization for the drug encapsulation percentage, vesicle size and Zeta potential then the study of nanovesicles stability and in vitro drug release profile was done. The study compared nano-stealth liposomes and nano-liposomes with the free ALA solution, intraperitoneal administration of these different ALA formulations in rats and observing the ability to identify parathyroids intraoperatively and evaluation of fluorescence differences between these groups. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Stealth liposomes were insignificantly higher in drug encapsulation%, in vitro drug release and zeta potential compared to conventional liposomes. Additionally, they needed less time for the start of the photosensitization and recorded the highest signal after spectrometry compared to the other two preparations. These data provide a new evidence of the potentiality of ALA-stealth Liposomes for identification of PTGs intraoperatively and could lead to propose a non-invasive procedure with reduced postoperative side effects.

"Abstract: Adherence to topical treatment for a variety of chronic skin conditions, such as psoriasis, acne, and atopic dermatitis, is known to be very poor. A number of factors contribute to this phenomenon, including lack of treatment efficacy and patient concerns regarding side effects, among others. At the forefront of barriers facing optimal patient adherence to topical treatment is choosing the ideal topical vehicle formulation. Medical professionals have demonstrated a lack of understanding with respect to the composition and nomenclature of the various topical formulations. In this review, we clarify the properties and definitions of the following topical formulations: ointments, creams, lotions, topical solutions, topical suspensions, gels, foams, and sprays. We also provide suggested areas of application for the aforementioned formulations and a succinct, patient-geared summary of their advantages and disadvantages. This review hopes to deliver a clear and concise practical summary of the most commonly encountered topical formulations for the treatment of cutaneous disease for medical professionals. This will allow clinicians to provide their patients with accurate information to facilitate informed choice of topical formulation, which may serve to improve treatment adherence. "
"Abstract: There remains an unmet dermatological need for innovative topical agents that achieve better longterm outcomes with fewer side effects. Modulation of the expression and activity of microRNA (miRNAs) represents an emerging translational framework for the development of such innovative therapies because changes in the expression of one miRNA can have wide-ranging effects on diverse cellular processes associated with disease. In this short review, the roles of miRNA in epidermal development, psoriasis, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and re-epithelisation are highlighted. Consideration is given to the delivery of oligonucleotides that mimic or inhibit miRNA function using vehicles such as cell penetrating peptides, spherical nucleic acids, deformable liposomes and liquid crystalline nanodispersions. Formulation of miRNA-directed oligonucleotides with such skin-penetrating epidermal agents will drive the development of RNA-based cutaneous therapeutics for deployment as primary or adjuvant therapies for epidermal disorders. "
"BACKGROUND: Solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) induces molecular and genetic changes in the skin, which result in skin cancer, photoageing and photosensitivity disorders. The use of sunscreens is advocated to prevent such photodamage; however, most formulations contain organic and inorganic UVR filters that are nonbiodegradable and can damage fragile marine ecosystems. Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are natural UVR-absorbing compounds that have evolved in marine species for protection against chronic UVR exposure in shallow-water habitats. OBJECTIVES: To determine if palythine, a photostable model MAA, could offer protection against a range of UVR-induced damage biomarkers that are important in skin cancer and photoageing. METHODS: HaCaT human keratinocytes were used to assess the photoprotective potential of palythine using a number of end points including cell viability, DNA damage (nonspecific, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and oxidatively generated damage), gene expression changes (linked to inflammation, photoageing and oxidative stress) and oxidative stress. The antioxidant mechanism was investigated using chemical quenching and Nrf2 pathway activation assays. RESULTS: Palythine offered statistically significant protection (P < 0·005) against all end points tested even at extremely low concentrations (0·3% w/v). Additionally, palythine was found to be a potent antioxidant, reducing oxidatively generated stress, even when added after exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Palythine is an extremely effective multifunctional photoprotective molecule in vitro that has potential to be developed as a natural and biocompatible alternative to currently approved UVR filters. "
"Abstract: The use of sunscreen products is widely promoted by schools, government agencies, and health-related organizations to minimize sunburn and skin damage. In this study, we developed stable solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) containing the chemical UV filter octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC). In parallel, we produced similar stable SLNs in which 20% of the OMC content was replaced by the botanical urucum oil. When these SLNs were applied to the skin of human volunteers, no changes in fluorescence lifetimes or redox ratios of the endogenous skin fluorophores were seen, suggesting that the formulations did not induce toxic responses in the skin. Ex vivo (skin diffusion) tests showed no significant penetration. In vitro studies showed that when 20% of the OMC was replaced by urucum oil, there was no reduction in skin protection factor (SPF), suggesting that a decrease in the amount of chemical filter may be a viable alternative for an effective sunscreen, in combination with an antioxidant-rich vegetable oil, such as urucum. There is a strong trend towards increasing safety of sun protection products through reduction in the use of chemical UV filters. This work supports this approach by producing formulations with lower concentrations of OMC, while maintaining the SPF. Further investigations of SPF in vivo are needed to assess the suitability of these formulations for human use. "
"Abstract: Sunscreens have been constantly improving in the past few years. Today, they provide an efficient protection not only in the UVB but also in the UVA spectral region of the solar radiation. Recently it could be demonstrated that 50% of all free radicals induced in the skin due to solar radiation are formed in the visible and infrared spectral region. The good protective efficacy of sunscreens in the UV region prompts people to stay much longer in the sun than if they had left their skin unprotected. However, as no protection in the visible and infrared spectral region is provided, high amounts of free radicals are induced here that could easily exceed the critical radical concentration. This chapter describes how the effect of sunscreens can be extended to cover also the visible and infrared spectral region of the solar radiation by adding pigments and antioxidants with high radical protection factors to the sunscreen formulations. "
"Abstract: The use of a broad spectrum sunscreen is considered one of the main and most popular measures for preventing the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) on the skin. In this study we have developed a novel in vitro method to assess sunscreens efficacy to protect calcineurin enzyme activity, a skin cell marker. The photoprotective efficacy of sunscreen products was assessed by measuring the UV-A1 radiation-induced depletion of calcineurin (Cn) enzyme activity in primary neonatal human dermal fibroblast (HDFn) cell lysates. After exposure to 24J/cm "

"BACKGROUND: A growing number of manufacturers are taking advantage of the ability of absorbent consumer products to deliver lotion to the skin. The lotion is included on these products to help protect the skin from adverse skin effects that can occur, including: (1) irritation, (2) over hydration of the stratum corneum, (3) dryness that can occur from extended exposure to highly absorbent consumer products, and (4) changes in pH. OBJECTIVE: This manuscript presents results of a quantitative lotion transfer study of adult incontinence products. Resulting lotion transfer is compared to the results of several separate experiments in which specific skin benefits have been correlated to lotion concentrations. METHODS: The behind-the-knee (BTK) lotion transfer protocol was used to quantitate lotion transfer from adult incontinence (AI) test products constructed using 2 lotion formulations and 2 configurations of lotion application. A modified arm patch protocol, in which skin sites of a measured dimension were pre-treated with specific volumes of lotion, was used to evaluate protective effects of lotion against exposure to irritants, and over hydration from wetted absorbent products. RESULTS: After a 6-hours continuous exposure in the BTK the 5-stripe lotion configuration products transferred (adjusted mean ± SE) 94 ± 11-104 ± 11 μg/cm CONCLUSIONS: We can conclude that pretreatment with 110 μg/cm "
"Abstract: Methotrexate loaded chitin nanogel (MCNG) was formulated for its topical use in psoriasis. MCNG was characterized by DLS, TEM and FTIR. The MCNG particles were spherical in shape with size of 196±14nm, having surface charge of +9.21±0.42 mv. MCNG exhibited greater swelling and drug release at acidic pH than neutral and alkaline conditions. The treatment with MCNG showed significant level of toxicity on HaCaT and THP-1 cells and was taken up well by HaCaT cells as revealed by fluorescent microscopy. MCNGs exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activity as revealed by the inhibitory effects observed on the activity of COX-2 and LOX-5 enzymes expressed in THP-1 cells. Skin permeation studies revealed an increased trasdermal flux of methotrexate from MCNG with loosened stratum corneum and other epidermal layers of skin in comparison with control methotrexate solution treated samples. Significant anti-psoriatic efficacy on imiquimod (IMQ) induced model of psoriasis without any dermal and systemic toxicities suggest that it as an ideal delivery platform for topical delivery of methotrexate in psoriasis. Thus it is expected to become a better alternative for the oral delivery of methotrexate in the selected disease. "
"Abstract: Synergists can counteract metabolic insecticide resistance by inhibiting detoxification enzymes or transporters. They are used in commercial formulations of insecticides, but are also frequently used in the elucidation of resistance mechanisms. However, the effect of synergists on genome-wide transcription in arthropods is poorly understood. In this study we used Illumina RNA-sequencing to investigate genome-wide transcriptional responses in an acaricide resistant strain of the spider mite Tetranychus urticae upon exposure to synergists such as S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF), diethyl maleate (DEM), piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and cyclosporin A (CsA). Exposure to PBO and DEF resulted in a broad transcriptional response and about one third of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including cytochrome P450 monooxygenases and UDP-glycosyltransferases, was shared between both treatments, suggesting common transcriptional regulation. Moreover, both DEF and PBO induced genes that are strongly implicated in acaricide resistance in the respective strain. In contrast, CsA treatment mainly resulted in downregulation of Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) genes, while DEGs of the DEM treatment were not significantly enriched for any GO-terms. "
"BACKGROUND: It has been reported that topical hypochlorous acid (HOCl) formulations lead to relief of itch in human patients with atopic dermatitis; however, the specific antipruritic mechanism of action remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To confirm itch relief and reduction of lesions in a mouse model of atopic dermatitis and to elucidate possible HOCl's mode of action. METHODS: In this study, the effects of topical administration of HOCl hydrogel (0.05%) on atopic dermatitis-like lesions in NC/Nga mice model as well as in vitro effects of HOCl on dorsal root ganglia neurons and mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (mBMDCs) were investigated. NC/Nga mice were sensitized with house dust mite allergen and treated topically with HOCl hydrogel both preventively and therapeutically against established lesions. Allergen challenge was continued during HOCl hydrogel application. RESULTS: Treatment with HOCl hydrogel prevented the development of lesions and scratching bouts during the whole observation period. When administered after full development of lesions, HOCl reduced lesions and scratching behaviour to a similar extent as a positive control 0.1% betamethasone dipropionate ointment. The reduced inflammatory response by HOCl treatment was demonstrated by reduced secretion of inflammatory cytokines in affected skin tissue from NC/Nga mice. In addition, HOCl significantly reduced IL-12 production in mBMDC. The diminished scratching behaviour was confirmed by impaired response to several pruritogens in dorsal root ganglia neurons excised from NC/Nga mice after termination of the studies. The response to the stimuli was also reduced by pre-incubation of sensory neurons from untreated BALB/c mice with 0.0001% HOCl. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These data indicate a direct reduction in sensory response by HOCl, leading to significantly reduced itch and inflammation in vivo. "
"Abstract: The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel assessed the safety of diethanolamine and its salts as used in cosmetics. Diethanolamine functions as a pH adjuster; the 16 salts included in this rereview reportedly function as surfactants, emulsifying agents, viscosity increasing agents, hair or skin conditioning agents, foam boosters, or antistatic agents. The Panel reviewed available animal and clinical data, as well as information from previous CIR reports. Since data were not available for each individual ingredient, and since the salts dissociate freely in water, the Panel extrapolated from previous reports to support safety. The Panel concluded that diethanolamine and its salts are safe for use when formulated to be nonirritating. These ingredients should not be used in cosmetic products in which N-nitroso compounds can be formed. "
"Abstract: Glucocorticoids (GCs) are used to treat lung disease. GCs incorporated in an exogenous pulmonary surfactant (EPS) could be an alternative management to improve drug delivery avoiding side effects. In the development of these pharmaceutical products, it is important to know the maximum amount of GC that can be incorporated and if increasing quantities of GCs alter EPS biophysical properties. Formulations containing EPS and beclomethasone, budesonide or fluticasone were analyzed (PL 10mg/ml; GC 1-2mg/ml). The microstructure was evaluated by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, GCs incorporated were determined by UV absorption and polarized light microscopy and surfactant activity with pulsating bubble surfactometer. We found that GCs have a ceiling of incorporation of around 10wt%, and that the GC not incorporated remains as crystals in the aqueous phase without altering the biophysical properties of the surfactant. This fact is important, because the greater the proportion of GC that EPS can carry, the better the efficiency of this pulmonary GC system. "
"OBJECTIVE: Characterize fluticasone propionate (Fp) and combination fluticasone propionate and salmeterol (FS) pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, delivered via a novel, inhalation-driven, multidose dry powder inhaler (MDPI). METHODS: This multicenter, open-label, four-period crossover, single-dose study randomized patients aged ≥12 years with persistent asthma to Fp MDPI 200 mcg, FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg, Fp dry powder inhaler (DPI) 500 mcg (250 mcg × 2 inhalations), or FS DPI 500/50 mcg.

"Abstract: Polysaccharides based nanocomplexes have been developed for encapsulation, controlled delivery and to enhance the phototoxicity of the photosensitizer 5-aminolevulinic acid for application in photodynamic therapy. The nanocomplexes were prepared by coacervation in a solvent free environment using chitosan as polycation while alginic and polygalacturonic acid as polyanions. The complexes showed average dimension in the range 90-120nm, good stability in simulated physiological media and high drug encapsulation efficiency, up to 800μg per mg of carrier. Release studies demonstrate the possibility to tune the overall release rate and the intensity of the initial burst by changing the external pH. Cytotoxicity and photocytotoxicity tests confirmed the not toxicity of the used polysaccharides. Cell viability results confirmed the improvement of 5-aminolevulinic acid phototoxicity when loaded into the carrier compared to the free form. No effect of the irradiation on the nanocomplexes structure and on the release kinetics of the drug was observed. The results demonstrate that the prepared formulations have suitable properties for future application in photodynamic therapy and to ameliorate the therapeutic efficacy and overcome the side-effects related to the use of the photosensitizer 5-aminolevulinic acid.

"BACKGROUND: Plane warts are a common therapeutic problem. Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of oral versus topical isotretinoin in the treatment of plane warts. METHODS: Forty patients with multiple plane warts were randomized into two groups. Group A was treated with oral isotretinoin capsules in the dose of 0.5 mg/kg/d and Group B with topical isotretinoin 0.05% in gel formulation once daily at night. Treatment was given to the patients for 3 months or until the complete clearance of lesions, whichever was earlier. Patients with complete response were followed up monthly for 4 months to record the relapse rate. RESULTS: Results were analyzed in 16 patients of Group A and 13 patients of Group B. At the end of 3 months of therapy, 11 (69%) patients in Group A had complete remission whereas five (31%) had partial remission. In Group B, at the end of study, five (38%) patients had complete remission and six (46%) had partial remission, whereas two patients had no remission. The difference was statistically significant between two groups; P < 0.0001. The most common side effect in Group A was cheilitis. In Group B, five patients had to be dropped because they developed severe erythema and scaling. CONCLUSION: Oral isotretinoin showed better and earlier response than topical isotretinoin. Oral isotretinoin should definitely be given a trial particularly in cases of multiple facial warts before trying various destructive procedures. "
"BACKGROUND: Drug delivery-based nanoparticles have been emerged to be an alternative and efficient approach to cancer therapy compared to conventional systems. Here, we investigated the role of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) formulated with precirol in increasing doxorubicin (Dox) induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. METHODS: ATRA-loaded Nano structured lipid carriers (NLCs) were evaluated in terms of particle size, zeta potential, Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), cell internalization, and scanning electron microscope (SEM). To understand molecular mechanism of apoptosis and cell cycle progression flow cytometric assay, MTT and DAPI staining was applied. Real time (RT)-PCR analysis was employed to investigate the expression of apoptosis related genes, including Survivin, Bcl-2 and Bax. RESULTS: The optimized ATRA formulation exhibited average particle size of 95±5nm with nearly narrow size distribution. The IC50 values for ATRA and doxorubicin were 48±0.4μM and 0.81±0.02μM, respectively. ATRA-loaded NLCs decreased percentage of cell proliferation from 51±7.2% to 36±4.1% (p <0.05). Co-treatment of the MDA-MB-231 cells with ATRA formulation and doxorubicin caused two-fold increase in the percentage of apoptosis (p<0.05). The results from gene expression exhibited a significant decrease in survivin along with increase at Bax mRNA levels accompanied by a slight increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. CONCLUSION: Our results propose that ATRA encapsulated in precirol as a biocompatible compound augments the efficacy of Dox in cancer therapy. "
"BACKGROUND: Neonates are at greater risk for central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) because of prolonged vascular access for nutrition and medications. Skin antisepsis using chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), particularly the formulation with alcohol (CHG/alcohol), during central line insertion and maintenance activities is a key clinical care process associated with CLABSI reduction. One area of ongoing confusion for many clinicians is whether to adhere to the manufacturer's recommendations that CHG remain on the skin following the procedure to promote persistent microbicidal effects or to foster product removal in hopes of preventing skin-related complications. PURPOSE: Determine the effect of a targeted education program on the knowledge and attitudes of nurses who place peripherally inserted central catheters in the NICU regarding the use and removal of CHG antiseptic. METHODS: A quasi-experimental presurvey/postsurvey quality improvement project (QI project) recruited participants from the electronic mailing list of a national neonatal nursing organization. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant deficiency in knowledge or misinformation related to the use of CHG/alcohol on the presurvey assessment. Eight questions reflecting knowledge consistent with most recent evidence were answered correctly only 11.4-25.7 percent of the time, all of which were considered statistically significant. Following completion of the education program, a nearly 100 percent correct response rate on all but three postsurvey questions resulted. CONCLUSIONS: This quality improvement project demonstrated success in the ability to change knowledge surrounding the removal of CHG/alcohol from the skin of babies in the NICU following completion of a targeted education program and the effectiveness of targeted web-based educational programs.

"Abstract: Cadmium is a well-known metallotoxin widespread in the environment and easily reaching cellular targets in lower and higher organisms, including humans. The form(s) of that metal ion through which it interacts with biomolecular targets in a cellular milieu are critical in cell survival. Poised to investigate the structure-specific activity of Cd(II) in a cellular environment and delve into the associated biotoxic processes, binary and ternary systems of that metal ion in the presence of the physiological α-hydroxycarboxylic acid glycolic acid and aromatic (N,N')-binders 2,2'-bipyridine (2,2'-bipy) and 4,4'-bipyridine (4,4'-bipy) were examined synthetically in aqueous media and a pH-specific fashion.

"Abstract: Atopic dermatitis affects 3-15% of the general dog population and it has been diagnosed by veterinarians up to 58% of dogs affected with skin disease. It is usually a life-long pathology which can be controlled, but it can be seldom cured. The present investigation describes a case study in which lactoferricin and verbascoside are part of a formulation to obtain a dermatological lotion for canine dermatitis treatment. The study was an open-label trial design of two-week treatment. Thirty-eight dogs (23 females and 15 males), with atopic dermatitis and secondary bacterial or yeast overgrowth have been included. During treatment period the total clinical score progressively decreased associated with an improvement in clinical signs. No adverse effects were reported in any of the treated dogs. The present research suggests that daily applications of tested emulsion are effective in reducing bacterial overgrowth and clinical signs in skin folds and atopic dermatitis. "
"Abstract: Increasing attention is addressed to identify products able to enhance skin photoprotection and to prevent skin carcinogenesis. Several studies have demonstrated that the α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (αMSH), acting on a functional MC1R, provides a photoprotective effect by inducing pigmentation, antioxidants and DNA repair. We discovered a link between αMSH and the nuclear receptor Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-γ (PPARγ), suggesting that some of the αMSH protective effects may be dependent on PPARγ transcriptional activity. Moreover, we demonstrated that the activation of PPARγ by the parrodiene 2,4,6-octatrienoic acid (Octa) induces melanogenesis and antioxidant defence in human melanocytes and counteracts senescence-like phenotype in human fibroblasts. In this study, we demonstrate that the activation of PPARγ by Octa exerts a protective effect against UVA- and UVB-induced damage on normal human keratinocytes (NHKs), the major target cells of UV radiation. Octa promotes the antioxidant defence, augments DNA repair and reduces the induction of proteins involved in UV-induced DNA damage response. Our results contribute to deepen the analysis of the αMSH/PPARγ connection and suggest perspectives for the development of new molecules and formulations able to prevent cutaneous UV damage by acting on the different skin cell populations through PPARγ activation.

"BACKGROUND: In intensive care units (ICUs), nosocomial infections are prevalent conditions and they have been related to high mortality indexes. Some studies have suggested that inefficient oral hygiene and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are related. Nowadays, in the Brazilian public health system there is no well-defined protocol for oral hygiene in an ICU. Due to the drawbacks of the use of antibiotics, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as an interesting technique in order to reduce antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. Methylene blue (MB) is the most common chemical agent for PDT in Brazil. However, new formulations for improved effectiveness are still lacking. The objective of this study is to evaluate the use of an MB mouthwash as an effective oral-hygiene procedure in an ICU and to show that oral hygiene using PDT with MB mouthwash may reduce VAP frequency to rates similar to, or higher than, chlorhexidine. METHODS: Phase 1 will evaluate the most effective cleaning procedure, while phase 2 will correlate oral hygiene to VAP incidence. At the start of phase 1, the ICU patients will be randomly allocated into three different groups (10 patients/group): the efficacy of chlorhexidine, classical MB-PDT, and mouthwash MB-PDT will all be measured for the quantification of viable bacteria, both pre- and post-treatment, by a Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). In phase 2, the most effective procedure found in phase 1 and a mechanical cleaning with filtered water will be carried out daily, once a day, over 5 days, with a total of 52 ICU patients randomly allocated into the two groups. The clinical records will be evaluated in order to find any pneumonic diagnoses. DISCUSSION: Since a variety of bacterial species are related to VAP, a universal primer for bacteria will be used in order to quantify the total bacteria count in the participants' samples. In order to quantify only the living bacteria before DNA extraction, the samples will be treated with propidium monoazide. This will infiltrate the dead bacteria and will intercalate the DNA bases, avoiding their DNA amplification. This will be the first trial to evaluate MB-PDT in a mouthwash formula that can increase the effectiveness due to the control of MB aggregation. The results of this study will be able to generate an easy and low-cost protocol to be used in an ICU for the Brazilian public health system. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Conjunto Hospitalar do Mandaqui (1.317.834, CAAE: 49273515.9.3001.5551) and it was registered in Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Clínicos (ReBEC number: RBR-94bvrc;). First received: 12 July 2015; 1st version 6 June 2016. Data will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. "
"Abstract: The anti-infection ability and skin regeneration are important aspects on the progress of wound healing, which needs an ideal wound dressing that not only resists bacteria but also promotes skin regeneration. In this study, zinc oxide/silver/polyvinylpyrrolidone/polycaprolactone (ZnO/Ag/PVP/PCL) nanofibres were prepared through electrospinning. Firstly, zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) and silver nanoparticle (AgNPs) were synthesized respectively. Secondly, the two nanoparticles were mixed with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polycaprolactone (PCL) to obtain the nanofibres. The results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that ZnONPs and AgNPs were 40.07 ± 9.70 nm and 37.46 ± 12.02 nm, respectively. After electrospinning, the nanofibres were 368.22 ± 123.96 nm in diameter. Infrared spectroscopy revealed that ZnONPs/AgNPs bimetallic nanomaterials were physically embedded in the nanofibres. The antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli of ZnO/Ag/PVP/PCL nanofibres were significantly better than these of the single metal material-loaded nanofibres. More importantly, the combination of ZnO and Ag reduced the cytotoxicity of ZnO/Ag/PVP/PCL bimetallic nanofibres toward fibroblasts. These findings demonstrated that ZnO/Ag/PVP/PCL bimetallic nanofibres should be of greater interest than the single metal nanomaterial-loaded nanofibres in inhibiting growth of bacteria. "
"BACKGROUND: Tranilast (N-[3, 4-dimethoxycinnamoyl] anthranilic acid), an antiallergic drug, has been shown to attenuate scar formation possibly through inhibition of transforming growth factor beta 1 activity and consequent suppression of collagen synthesis in fibroblasts. OBJECTIVE: The authors aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of tranilast 8% gel in improving the appearance and symptoms of new post-cesarean section surgical wounds. METHODS: In this prospective double-blind split-scar study, the authors treated each half scar of 26 women with either tranilast 8% liposomal gel or tranilast-free liposomal gel (placebo). Treatment was applied twice daily for 3 months. Twenty women completed the trial. Scar halves were evaluated by 2 investigators and by the patients 9 months after the last application using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). The participants also rated overall satisfaction and recorded side effects of the treatment. RESULTS: The mean POSAS scores at 9 months post-treatment were significantly lower for tranilast-treated half scars compared with placebo-treated half scars (p < .001). The women were significantly more satisfied with the tranilast-treated half-scar appearance (p = .002). Three participants reported itching and erythema on the tranilast-treated side. CONCLUSION: Topical tranilast 8% gel provided significantly better postcaesarian section scar cosmesis and user satisfaction compared with placebo. "

"UNLABELLED: <p>BACKGROUND: Topical corticosteroids are the most common dermatologic medications and are available in numerous different vehicles. Adherence is limited by traditional vehicles because they are messy and time consuming to apply. The preferred spray formulations have the advantage of being applied with ease, resulting in improved adherence and subsequently improved psoriasis. One limitation of topical treatments, especially spray vehicles, is the potential for irritation and sensitization.</p> <p>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the irritation and sensitization potential of topical desoximetasone spray formulation.</p> <p>METHODS: A multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, controlled study assessed the irritancy and sensitization of 0.25% and 0.05% topical desoximetasone spray. Controls included vehicle, a positive control (0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate), negative control (0.9% saline), and an active comparator control (clobetasol spray). The primary outcome of the study was to evaluate the difference in mean cumulative irritation and potential sensitization response of desoximetasone 0.25% and 0.05% topical sprays.</p> <p>RESULTS: Of the 297 enrolled, 269 completed the study per protocol for the irritation phase and 250 completed the protocol for the sensitization phase. At 22 days, desoximetasone 0.25 and 0.5% spray were less irritating than clobetasol 0.05% spray; mean irritation score difference of -0.46 and -0.57, respectively. Median total irritation score over the 22 days was 0 for all products. No subjects demonstrated any sensitization reaction to any of the six products. No serious adverse reactions were reported.</p> <p>LIMITATIONS: Selection bias, use of a healthy population, limits the external validity. In addition, the duration of the study was short lived, unlike numerous inflammatory skin diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Desoximetasone spray has little potential for irritation or sensitization. The availability of another spray option for patients desiring less messy treatment may facilitate better adherence and treatment outcomes.</p> <p><em>J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(8):755-758.</em></p>.

"Abstract: Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure is known to cause inevitable damage to human skin via different mechanisms which include disruption of genetic material and generation of free radicals. In the ever emerging field of photoprotective agents, there have been constant endeavors to uphold the standards for optimum protection from solar UV-induced damages which include alarming conditions ranging from severe keratosis to malignant transformation of skin cells. Out of the various methods available for photoprotection, chemical photoprotective agents are most popular due to its ease of applicability, availability, and efficacy. However, the benevolences of chemophotoprotective agents are not excluded from the fact that all chemical agents are bound to suffer predestined consequences of toxicity and unwanted side effects. The present article focuses on the basic knowledge pertaining to achieve adequate sun protection and also on the beneficial and risk factors of using chemical agents as photoprotective formulations. The article highlights the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved and unapproved UV filters; and also sheds light on the overall measures to protect an individual from UV radiation exposure, dispel misconceptions and present the newer technologies that are available in the market to accomplish ideal sun protection.

"PURPOSE: Topical administration of the anti-inflammatory agent cyclosporin A (CsA) is recommended for long-term management of dry eye syndrome (DES), yet standard ophthalmic CsA preparations have been reported to be unstable. In this trial, the efficacy and safety of Clacier™ (based on a phase 3 study developed by Huons Co. Ltd.), a novel 0.05% CsA nanoemulsion formulation, are compared with those of the conventional Restasis METHODS: Patients with moderate-to-severe DES were randomly assigned to receive topical 0.05% CsA in the form of Clacier or Restasis, to be administered twice daily for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline in corneal fluorescein staining scores at week 12; changes at weeks 4 and 8 were secondary endpoints. Additional endpoints included score changes from baseline in nonanesthetic Schirmer's test I, tear breakup time, ocular surface disease index, and conjunctival staining. RESULTS: At week 12, corneal staining scores were improved in patients treated with Clacier and Restasis, with no significant difference between treatments (P = 0.41). Temporal conjunctival surface damage was significantly more ameliorated with Clacier treatment than with Restasis treatment (P = 0.034). Notably, tear film stability was improved more rapidly in Clacier patients at week 4 (P = 0.005) than in Restasis patients (P = 0.36). Improvements in tear production were comparable with both Clacier and Restasis treatments. Clacier did not increase the risk of adverse events as compared with Restasis. CONCLUSION: Treatment with Clacier alleviated clinical signs and symptoms of DES comparably to the commercially available Restasis, resulting in improved quality of life for patients. Clacier is an effective and safe therapeutic agent for DES. "
"Abstract: The systemic administration of methotrexate (MTX), a commonly used, antineoplastic drug which is also used in cutaneous disorders, is primarily associated with prolonged retention in the body and consequently with side effects. Innovative drug delivery techniques and alternative administration routes would therefore contribute to its safe and effective use. The general objective of this study is thus the development of MTX-based preparations for the topical treatment of skin disorders. MCM-41-like nanoparticles (MSN), are herein proposed as carriers which can improve the cutaneous absorption and hence the bioavailability and efficacy of MTX. The MTX/MSN complex, prepared via the impregnation procedure, has been physico-chemically characterized, while its cell cultures have had their biocompatibility and bioactivity tested. Furthermore, a series of stable MTX-based dermal formulations has been developed, some containing shea butter, a natural fat. Ex-vivo porcine skin absorption and the transepidermal permeation of MTX have also been monitored in a variety of media using Franz diffusion cells. Interestingly, the epidermal accumulation of the active molecule was increased by its inclusion into MSN, regardless of the surrounding medium. Furthermore, the presence of shea butter enhanced the skin uptake of the drug both in the free and in the loaded form. "
"Abstract: Immunosuppressive drugs for solid organ transplantation are critical dose drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Many of the most commonly used innovator drugs are off patent and have been replicated by generic counterparts, often at substantial cost-savings to the patient. However, serious adverse events caused by the transition from innovator to generic medications, specifically in pediatric solid organ transplant recipients, have questioned these autosubstitutions. The purpose of this review is to summarize the criteria set forth by the regulatory bodies, and to examine how major immunosuppressive drugs conform to these recommendations. Regulatory bodies have established inconsistent criteria to demonstrate bioequivalence between innovator and generic medications, causing approved generic variations to have varying levels of equivalence with the innovator drugs. In order to minimize the risk for under-immunosuppression, the following recommendations have been concluded. Brand prescribing of cyclosporine and tacrolimus are recommended due to evidence of adverse events after conversion to generic formulations and differences in dissolution parameters. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) shows better bioequivalence between innovator and generic formulations, however caution should be advised when switching between formulations. The institution of 'innovator only' policies may be appropriate at this time in order to minimize the risk of under-immunosuppressing patients until the evidence of more stringent bioequivalence has been established.

"Abstract: In an effort to reduce the frequency and severity of adverse reactions seen from the use of mineral oil adjuvants in salmonid fish, the effects of two alternative adjuvants were assessed, focusing on the induction of adverse effects as well as protection. Using rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as recipients, injection vaccines based on formalin-inactivated Aeromonas salmonicida subspecies salmonicida were formulated with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, the liposomal cationic adjuvant formulation 01 (CAF01) or with Freund's incomplete adjuvant and administered intraperitoneally. Control groups of unvaccinated, Tris-buffered saline-injected or bacterin-injected individuals were included, and each group included in the study held a total number of 240 individuals. Subsequently, individuals from each group were examined for differences in Fulton's condition factor, macro- and microscopic pathological changes, as well as protection against experimental infection with A. salmonicida. While adverse effects were not eliminated, reductions in microscopic and macroscopic adverse effects, in particular, were seen for both the nucleotide- and liposome-based vaccine formulations. Furthermore, the induced protection appears similar to that of the benchmark formulation, thus introducing viable, potential alternative types of adjuvants for use in future fish vaccines. "
"Abstract: Cyclosporin A (CyA) is an immunosuppressive drug used topically to treat ocular inflammatory disorder such as dry eye disease (DES). It is a lipophilic cyclic peptide with molecular weight of 1202.6Da. The aim of this study was to develop surfactant free aqueous 0.2% (w/v) CyA eye drops where the drug is present in an aqueous vehicle containing CyA/cyclodextrin (CyA/CD) nanoparticles and then do three-month toxicological testing in rabbits. Five formulations of different CD concentrations were studied, all of them contained 12.5% (w/v) of α-cyclodextrin (αCD) and various amounts of γ-cyclodextrin (γCD) (ranging from 0 to 12.5% w/v). αCD was used to solubilize the drug and γCD to promote formation of complex aggregates. CyA/CD complex aggregates were formed in all the formulations tested. However, the formulation containing 12.5% (w/v) αCD and 12.5% (w/v) γCD created more CyA/CD nanoparticles of suitable size and was therefore tested in vivo. The eye drops did not cause ocular irritation or toxic side effects upon topical administration to rabbits once or twice a day for three months. "
"Abstract: Nano metal oxides have been proposed as alternatives to silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) for antibacterial coatings. Here, cotton and polyester-cotton fabrics were sonochemically coated with zinc oxide (ZnO) and copper oxide (CuO) NPs. By varying the reaction solvent (water or ethanol), NPs with different sizes and shapes were synthesized. The cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory effects of studied NPs were investigated in vitro in human alveolar epithelial A549 and macrophage-like THP1 cells. To understand the potential respiratory impact of the NPs, the coated textiles were subjected to the abrasion tests, and the released airborne particles were measured. A very small amount of the studied metal oxides NPs was released from abrasion of the textiles coated by the ethanol-based sonochemical process. The release from the water-based coating was comparably higher. Lung and immune cells viability decreased after 24 h of exposure only at the highest studied NPs concentration (100 μg/mL). Different from the ZnO NPs, both formulations of CuO NPs induced IL-8 release in the lung epithelial cells already at subtoxic concentrations (1-10 μg/mL) but not in immune cells. All of the studied NPs did not induce IL-6 release by the lung and immune cells. Calculations revealed that the exposures of the NPs to human lung due to the abrasion of the textiles were lower or comparable to the minimum doses in the cell viability tests (0.1 μg/mL), at which acute cytotoxicity was not observed. The results alleviate the concerns regarding the potential risk of these metal oxide NPs in their applications for the textile coating and provide insight for the safe-by-design approach. "
"Abstract: The therapy of inflammatory bowel diseases is still rather inefficient, and about 80% of patients require surgery at some stage. Improving the treatments by more efficient medication is, therefore, an urgent medical need. The objective of this project was to demonstrate targeted delivery of Cyclosporine-A (CYA) to the inflamed areas of the intestinal mucosa after oral administration, enabling improved alleviation of the symptoms and, at the same time, reduced systemic drug absorption and associated adverse effects. As had already been demonstrated in previous studies, nano- to micrometer-sized drug particles will accumulate at inflamed mucosal areas, providing a platform for such purposes. CYA as incorporated in poly-(lactic-co-glycolic-Acid) (PLGA) nano- and mirocarriers, respectively, each homogeneous in size and providing controlled drug release over 24h at intestinal pH-value. For comparative reasons, a commercial formulation (Sandimmun Neoral®) was included in the study. In an acute model of DSS-induced inflammation in Balb/c mice, up to three doses were administered for each formulation: 50mg/kg, 25mg/kg and 12.5mg/kg. Drug-free particles were included as control. The following parameters were evaluated: body weight, colon length, colon weight/length ratio, cytokine expression and histological analysis. Plasma levels of CYA were analysed to compare systemic bioavailability. While disease parameters, such as, e.g. colon length, always improved with an optimum dose of 25mg/kg, the commercial and the microparticulate formulations led to measurable plasma levels and adverse effects in terms of body weight loss at the highest dose. In contrast, when administering the same doses as nanoparticles, plasma concentrations remained always below the detection limit, and the body weight of the animals remained unchanged. In conclusion, this study corroborates the potential of nanocarriers enabling an improved topical delivery of CYA to the inflamed gut mucosa after oral administration yielding the same improvement of disease parameters at only half the dose in comparison to microparticles and a commercial oral formulation, respectively, and at the same time minimizing systemic exposure and associated adverse effect.

"Abstract: Patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis (TB) show good tolerance of the medications used and have few side effects. However, medications used to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) have many known side effects. Here, we studied the occurrence of side effects due to treatment of patients with MDR-TB.We conducted a retrospective and consecutive review of the medical records of 256 patients who received treatment for MDR-TB between January 2006 and December 2011.One or more side effects were observed in 95 (37.1%) of the 256 patients. These side effects led to the suspension of the use of 1 or more drugs from the regimen of individualized treatment prescribed for 44 of the patients (17.2%). The side effects observed most frequently included gastrointestinal disturbance (18.4%), psychiatric disorder (5.5%), arthralgia (4.7%), hepatitis (3.9%), peripheral neuropathy (3.1%), hypothyroidism (2.3%), epileptic seizures (2%), dermatological effects (2%), ototoxicity (1.6%), and nephrotoxicity (1.2%). The treatment was successful in 220 (85.9%) patients with MDR-TB.Our study may help in formulating strategies for the timely and aggressive management of drug side effects. This may reduce the suspension of therapy and increase the rate of clinical success. "
"Abstract: Ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure has been known to cause irreparable damages to human skin. The daunting risk of UV radiation exposure faced by military personnel led to the development of a sunscreen formulation which has superior sun protection factor combined with the ability to counteract reactive oxygen species. The present work deals with the preclinical safety evaluation of the sunscreen formulation comprising of four US FDA approved UV filters; namely avobenzone, octinoxate, oxybenzone, titanium dioxide along with melatonin and pumpkin seed oil, via OECD protocols of assessing acute oral and dermal toxicity; skin sensitizing; skin irritating; ocular irritating and genotoxic potential.

"BACKGROUND: Cosmetic preservatives are used to protect cosmetic formulations and improve its shelf-life. However, these substances may exert phototoxic effects when used under sunlight. OBJECTIVE: To assess safety, efficacy and putative phototoxic effects of a sunscreen formulation SPF 30 and its excipients. MATERIALS/METHODS: Irradiation was performed with solar simulated light (SSL) and the sunscreen from the School of Pharmacy/UFRJ/Brazil. We used albino hairless mice in different groups (control (G1), only irradiated (G2), sunscreen plus irradiation (G3) and vehicle plus irradiation (G4) for morphological assessment and immunefluorescence detection to OKL38. In vitro analyses were with a Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) strain plus SSL in the presence of methylparaben, propylparaben, imidazolidinyl urea, aminomethyl propanol and their association. RESULTS: G3 and G4 displayed photosensitization leading to thickening of the epidermis and increased dermal cellularity. G4 displayed strong OKL38 labeling when compared with other groups. Aminomethyl propanol, methylparaben and propylparaben are endowed with phototoxic activity against SC. Propylparaben displayed the highest phototoxic effect, followed by excipients association. CONCLUSIONS: The sunscreen's vehicle is endowed with phototoxic activity. Propylparaben was the most phototoxic agent, increasing the overall phototoxicity of excipient association, pointing to a critical concern regarding vehicle associations intended to cosmetic purposes.

"Abstract: All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a derivative of vitamin A, is a common component in cosmetics and commercial acne creams as well as being a first-line chemotherapeutic agent. Today, formulations for the topical application of ATRA rely on creams and emulsions to incorporate the highly hydrophobic ATRA drug. These strategies, when applied to the skin, deliver ATRA as a single bolus, which is immediately taken up into the skin and contributes to many of the known adverse side effects of ATRA treatment, including skin irritation and hair loss. Herein we present a new concept in topical delivery of retinoids by covalently bonding the drug through a hydrolytically degradable ester linkage to a common hydrophilic polymer, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), creating an amphiphilic nanomaterial that is water-soluble. This PVA bound ATRA can then act as a pro-drug and accumulate within the skin to allow for the sustained controlled delivery of active ATRA. This approach was demonstrated to release active ATRA out to 10days in vitro while significantly enhancing dermal accumulation of the ATRA in explant pig skin. In vivo we demonstrate that the pro-drug formulation reduces application site inflammation compared to free ATRA and retains the drug at the application site at measurable quantities for up to six days.

"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Androgenetic alopecia is an extremely common dermatological disorder affecting both men and women. Oral finasteride (FNS), a synthetic 4-aza-3-oxosteroid compound with poor aqueous solubility, blocks the peripheral conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in a significant reduction in DHT concentration, achieving satisfactory results in alopecia treatment. However, its oral intake generally causes severe side effects. Considering that there is currently no scientifically proven treatment, new drug delivery systems able to improve alopecia therapy are urgently required. METHODS: In this study, polymeric nanoparticles have been proposed as a new carrier for topical delivery of FNS in hair follicles. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Polymeric nanoparticles, prepared by using a modified method of the emulsification/solvent diffusion, showed a mean particle size around 300 nm, which may be sufficient for reaching the dermis and hair follicles and negative zeta potential values. Scanning electron microscope measurements showed that all the polymeric nanoparticles exhibited a spherical shape and a smooth surface regardless of their composition. A high encapsulation efficiency was achieved for FNS (79.49 ± 0.47%). In vitro release assays in physiological conditions demonstrated that nanoparticles yielded a prolonged release of FNS for 3 h. Skin assays through an in vitro permeation study demonstrated that nanoparticles had low levels of penetration of FNS, improving its time residence onto the skin. All excipients used in nanoparticle composition and in 3 different vehicles were safe. These results suggest that the proposed novel formulation presents several good characteristics indicating its suitability for dermal delivery of FNS for alopecia treatment. "
"Abstract: <p>BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris has varying physical and psychological effects in men and women of different ages, races, and ethnicities.</p> <p>OBJECTIVE: This analysis assessed the relationship of age, sex, and race to treatment response with once-daily topical dapsone gel, 7.5%.</p> <p>METHODS: We conducted a pooled subgroup analysis of 2 randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trials conducted in the US and Canada. The studies included patients with 20 to 50 inflammatory and 30 to 100 noninflammatory facial lesions, and a Global Acne Assessment Score (GAAS) of 3 (moderate). Pooled data (N=4340) were analyzed by age (12-17 and ≥18 years), sex, and race (Caucasian and non-Caucasian) for GAAS success (score of 0 [none] or 1 [minimal]) and mean percent change from baseline in inflammatory, noninflammatory, and total lesion counts. The impact of age and sex on treatment response was examined using multivariate analysis. Adverse events were analyzed by subgroups.</p> <p>RESULTS: Treatment responses with dapsone gel, 7.5% were greater overall and for all subgroups versus vehicle. GAAS success rates and mean decrease in all lesion counts with dapsone gel, 7.5% were greater in older (aged ≥18 years) versus younger patients, and for females versus males. Treatment response with dapsone gel, 7.5% in racial subgroups was similar. Multivariate analysis showed statistical significance for age group and sex as predictors of GAAS success (P less than equal to .005) and reduction in lesion counts (P less than equal to .025). Adverse events were similar across subgroups.</p> <p>CONCLUSIONS: Older age (≥18 years) and female sex were predictors of treatment response. These subgroups tended to have greater acne improvement in subgroup comparisons. Caucasian and non-Caucasian patients had similar responses. The safety profile of dapsone gel, 7.5% was similar across subgroups.</p> <p><em>J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(6):591-598.</em></p>. "
"Abstract: <p>INTRODUCTION: Truncal acne is often associated with facial acne, but there are fewer options for an effective topical treatment on the trunk. Given the advent of foam formulations with enhanced percutaneous absorption and convenient application due to easy spreadability on skin, the previously held idea that effective treatment of truncal acne requires oral treatment is challenged. Azelaic acid cream has been previously approved for acne vulgaris, thus azelaic acid foam may be a viable treatment option for truncal acne.</p> <p>STUDY DESIGN: A single-center, open label pilot study was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of azelaic acid 15% foam as a treatment modality for moderate truncal acne. Use for facial acne was also allowed and monitored during the study.</p> <p>RESULTS: Twice-daily application of azelaic acid 15% foam to affected areas resulted in a 1-grade reduction in truncal investigator global assessment (IGA) scores in nearly all patients (16/18). Eight out of 18 patients (44%) were rated as Clear or Almost Clear in the trunk by the end of the study. There were also improvements in facial IGA scores; 9 of 18 patients (50%) exhibited a 1-grade improvement in IGA scores and 11 of 18 were Clear or Almost Clear by the end of the study. A significant reduction in lesion counts was found throughout the study and the medication was well tolerated.</p> <p>CONCUSION: Azelaic acid 15% foam was effective in treating moderate truncal acne and facial acne in this pilot study. Given the efficacy and convenience of the foam vehicle, azelaic acid may be considered as a viable option for treatment of acne vulgaris, including on the trunk. Further studies are suggested in a larger population of patients, including adult females with acne.</p> <p><em>J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(6):534-538.</em></p>. "
"Abstract: Nanotechnology is a rapidly developing branch of science, which studies control of phenomena and materials sized below 100 nm. Nanotechnology is applicable in many areas of life and medicine including skin care and personal hygiene. The nanoparticles (NPs) of metals and metal oxides are increasingly used in dermatology and cosmetology, especially in prevention and treatment of bacterial and fungal infections, in protection against the harmful effects of the sun and in preparations reducing the visibility of scars by accelerating the repair processes of skin cells. NPs may also be used for skin care and dermatological treatments to improve the quality of life of patients. Nanodermatology and nanocosmetology offer effective, safe, fast-acting product formulations, thus minimizing the side effects of the products used so far. The unique properties of NPs: high surface area relative to the size as well as the ability to penetrate biological membranes and barriers greatly reduces systemic dose thus potential side effects and toxicity. Recent studies show very promising clinical potential of NPs to serve as controlled release and delivery systems for drugs/active substances. In addition, NPs can be used in diagnostic imaging of skin diseases. However, NPs may also carry a risk of cytotoxicity and side effects. The present review focuses on the use of metal and metal oxide NPs in dermatology and cosmetology and their interactions with skin cells. "
"AIM: We encountered a case of fetal toxicity due to ductus arteriosus (DA) constriction in a 36-week pregnant woman who had applied multiple ketoprofen patches. The aim of the present study was to present the case and develop a model to predict quantitatively the fetal toxicity risk of transdermal administration of ketoprofen. METHODS: Human placenta perfusion studies were conducted to estimate transplacental pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. Using a developed model and these parameters, human fetal plasma concentration profiles of ketoprofen administered to mothers were simulated. Using pregnant rats, DA constriction and fetal plasma drug concentration after ketoprofen administration were measured, fitted to an Emax model, and extrapolated to humans. RESULTS: Transplacental transfer value at the steady state of ketoprofen was 4.82%, which was approximately half that of antipyrine (passive marker). The model and PK parameters predicted almost equivalent mother and fetus drug concentrations at steady state after transdermal ketoprofen administration in humans. Maximum DA constriction and maximum plasma concentration of ketoprofen after administration to rat dams were observed at different times: 4 h and 1 h, respectively. The model accurately described the delay in DA constriction with respect to the fetal ketoprofen concentration profile. The model with effect compartment and the obtained parameters predicted that use of multiple ketoprofen patches could potentially cause severe DA constriction in the human fetus, and that fetal toxicity might persist after ketoprofen discontinuation by the mother, as observed in our case. CONCLUSION: The present approach successfully described the sustained fetal toxicity after discontinuing the transdermal administration of ketoprofen. "
"Abstract: <p>Background: Ingenol mebutate gel 0.015% provides high clearance rates for actinic keratosis (AK) on the face and scalp but causes transient local skin responses (LSRs).</p> <p>Objective: This study sought to determine whether the application of 1% dimethicone would decrease ingenol mebutate-associated LSRs and/or affect efficacy during the treatment of multiple AKs on the face.</p> <p>Methods: Ingenol mebutate gel 0.015% was applied for 3 days to two 25 cm2 areas, each containing 3 to 8 AKs on the face of each subject, followed by application of 1% dimethicone lotion in an investigator-blinded manner to one randomly selected AK-containing area until LSRs were no longer present.</p> <p>Results: In total, 20 subjects were enrolled and completed the study. Topical 1% dimethicone lotion applied during and after treatment of facial AK with ingenol mebutate gel 0.015% reduced mean total LSR scores at days 8 and 15 compared with ingenol mebutate gel only, although the difference was not statistically significant. Efficacy was equivalent between the two treatment arms.</p> <p>Limitations: The study evaluated a relatively small number of subjects, all of whom were white.</p> <p>Conclusions: The application of 1% dimethicone following ingenol mebutate gel 0.015% produced a trend toward lower severity of some LSRs, with no difference in efficacy.</p> <p><em>J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(5):432-436.</em></p>.

"BACKGROUND: Contact allergy is a common condition and can severely interfere with daily life or professional activities. Due to changes in exposures, such as introduction of new substances, new products or formulations and regulatory intervention, the spectrum of contact sensitization changes. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the current spectrum of contact allergy to allergens present in the European baseline series (EBS) across Europe. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of data collected by the European Surveillance System on Contact Allergies (ESSCA, www.essca-dc.org) in consecutively patch-tested patients, 2013/14, in 46 departments in 12 European countries. RESULTS: Altogether, 31 689 patients were included in the analysis. Compared to a similar analysis in 2004, the prevalence of contact allergy to methylisothiazolinone went up to around 20% in several departments. In comparison, contact allergy to the metals nickel, cobalt and chromium remained largely stable, at 18.1%, 5.9% and 3.2%, respectively, similar to mostly unchanged prevalence with fragrance mix I, II and Myroxylon pereirae (balsam of Peru) at 7.3%, 3.8% and 5.3%, respectively. In the subgroup of departments diagnosing (mainly) patients with occupational contact dermatitis, the prevalence of work-related contact allergies such as epoxy resin or rubber additives was found to be increased, compared to general dermatology departments. CONCLUSION: Continuous surveillance of contact allergy based on network data offers the identification of time trends or persisting problems, and thus enables focussing in-depth research (subgroup analyses, exposure analysis) on areas where it is needed.

"BACKGROUND: Unwanted side effects such as dryness, hypersensitivity, and cutaneous photosensitivity are challenge for adherence and therapeutical success for patients using treatments for inflammatory and allergic skin response. AIMS: In this study, we compared the effects of two dermatological formulations, which are used in inflammatory and/or allergic skin conditions: dexchlorpheniramine maleate (DCP; 10 mg/g) and promethazine (PTZ; 20 mg/g). METHODS: We evaluated both formulations for phototoxicity potential, skin irritation, anti-inflammatory and antihistaminic abilities, and skin barrier repair in vitro and ex vivo using the standard OECD test guideline n° 432, the ECVAM protocol n° 78, and cultured skin explants from a healthy patient. Ultraviolet A was chosen as exogenous agent to induce allergic and inflammatory response. RESULTS: Both PTZ and DCP promoted increases in interleukin-1 (IL-1) synthesis in response to ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation compared to control. However, the increase observed with PTZ was significantly greater than the DCP, indicating that the latter has a lower irritant potential. DCP also demonstrated a protective effect on UVA-induced leukotriene B4 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) synthesis. Conversely, PTZ demonstrates more robust UVA antihistaminic activity. Likewise, PTZ promoted a significantly greater increase in the production of involucrin and keratin 14, both associated with protective skin barrier property. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, these data suggest possible diverging UVA response mechanisms of DCP and PTZ, which gives greater insight into the contrasting photosensitizing potential between DCP and PTZ observed in the patients.

"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Combination treatments of chemotherapy and nanoparticle drug delivery have shown significant promise in cancer treatment. The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of a nanodrug complex with its free form in the treatment of tongue squamous cell carcinoma induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in rats. METHODS: In this study, 75 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) was induced by using 4- nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) as a carcinogen. Newly formulated doxorubicin (DOX)-methotrexate (MTX)-loaded nanoparticles, and free DOX-MTX were administrated intravenously to rats. During the study, the animals were weighed once a week. At the end of the treatment, rats' tongues were evaluated histopathologically. RESULTS: There was significant difference between the mean weight of rats in groups A and B (P=0.001) and also groups A and K (P<0.001). No significant association was found between the mortality rate of groups. The difference between the severity of dysplasia of treated and untreated groups was significant (P<0.001). INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that DOX-MTX nanoparticle complex was more effective than free DOX-MTX in chemotherapy treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma in rat models. Further investigations are necessary to clarify the advantages and disadvantages of the nanoparticle complex and its potential therapeutic application for different types of cancer. "
"BACKGROUND: Generalised pustular psoriasis (GPP) and acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau (ACH) are chronic, relapsing variants of pustular psoriasis proven to be remarkably challenging to treat. Due to their uncommon presentation, there are few described cases in literature and scarce evidence for management. Further information is needed to help dermatologists formulate treatment plans for patients presenting with such diseases. CASE SUMMARY: We report the case of a 68-year-old man with a 3-year history of psoriasis presenting to our clinic with a severe breakout of GPP and associated ACH. The patient underwent treatment with cyclosporine A (200 mg PO twice daily) for a period of 2 weeks. This provided dramatic improvement in disease symptoms, with clearance of pustules, remarkable reduction of ACH lesions, and absence of pain. The patient was transitioned to infliximab (5 mg/kg intravenous) and apremilast (30 mg PO twice daily), displaying minimal GPP relapse and well-controlled onychodystrophy for several months. CONCLUSION: This case supports the use of cyclosporine as a first-line agent in providing immediate symptomatic relief for pustular psoriasis flares. Transitioning to infliximab and apremilast combination therapy offers a unique treatment regime for long-term GPP and ACH management. "
"Abstract: Sunscreens have been widely used by the general public for their photoprotective properties, including prevention of photocarcinogenesis and photoaging and management of photodermatoses. It is important to emphasize to consumers the necessity of broad-spectrum protection, with coverage of both ultraviolet A (320-400 nm) and ultraviolet B (290-320 nm) radiation. This review discusses the benefits of sunscreen, different ultraviolet filters, sunscreen regulations and controversies, the importance of broad-spectrum protection, issues of photostability and formulation, and patient education and compliance.

"Abstract: Incorporation of antioxidants into sunscreens is a logical approach, yet co-delivery of them with UV filters is a challenge. Here, we purposed a combination therapy, in which the chemical UV filter, octyl methoxycinnamate, was accumulated on upper skin while the antioxidant, melatonin, can penetrate deeper layers to show its effects. Melatonin-loaded elastic niosomes and octyl methoxycinnamate Pickering emulsion were prepared separately. Lyophilized elastic niosomes were dispersed into the Pickering emulsion to prepare the proposed combination formulation. The characterization studies of the formulations revealed that elastic niosomes can be prepared with tunable nanometer sizes, whereas Pickering emulsions can encapsulate the UV filter in micrometer-sized droplets. Melatonin-loaded elastic niosomes prepared with Tween80/Span80 mixture were 146 nm with a PI of 0.438, and 58.42% entrapment efficiency was achieved. The mean diameter size of the combination formulation was 27.8 μm. Ex vivo permeation studies revealed that 7.40% of octyl methoxycinnamate and 58% of melatonin were permeated through the rat skin while 27.6% octyl methoxycinnamate and 37% of melatonin accumulated in the skin after 24 h. Cell culture studies with real-time cell analyzer showed that the proposed formulation consist of melatonin-loaded elastic niosomes and octyl methoxycinnamate Pickering emulsion had no negative effect on the cell proliferation and viability. According to α,α-diphenyl-β-picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging method, the proposed formulation showed as high antioxidant activity as melatonin itself. It is concluded that the proposed formulation would be a promising dual therapy for UV-induced skin damage with co-delivery strategy. "
"BACKGROUND: Treatment for recalcitrant plantar warts remains a continuing challenge as the options for treatment have differing levels of success. long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser is considered a good treatment modality in resistant plantar warts. On the other hand, high cure rates have been reported with a topical proprietary formulation consisting of 1% cantharidin, 5% podophyllotoxin, 30% salicylic acid. AIM: To compare the efficacy of 1% cantharidin, 20% podophylline resin and 30% salicylic acid (CPS) versus long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser in the treatment of recalcitrant plantar warts. METHODS: This study included 30 patients with single or multiple recalcitrant plantar warts; patients were assigned to two groups: the first group included 15 patients with 71 recalcitrant plantar warts who were treated by long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser (group I) and the second group included 15 patients with 78 recalcitrant plantar warts who received CPS (group II). The diagnosis of plantar warts was made by clinical examination. RESULTS: Fourteen patients (93%) were completely cleared of their warts with topical CPS, while 11 patients (73%) showed complete clearance with long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser with statistically significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Topical CPS is safe and efficacious and represents a promising therapeutic modality than long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser in the treatment of recalcitrant plantar warts. "
"Abstract: The photodynamic properties of Hypericin (Hyp) may be used as an alternative treatment for malignancies of the lower gastrointestinal tract and for the prevention of surgical-site infection; however, its use in photodynamic therapy has been limited because of its poor hydrosolubility. Therefore, in order to improve its water solubility and its photodynamic effect, Hyp was encapsulated in Pluronic P123 (P123) and the photodynamic effects against intestinal and epidermal bacteria and against two lineages of intestinal colon carcinoma cells were investigated. Two response surface methods (RSM) were used to achieve the best in vitro photodynamic activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus: in the first (full 2 "
"PURPOSE: Beyond-use dating (BUD) of lidocaine alone and in two ""magic mouthwash"" preparations stored in amber oral syringes at room temperature was determined. METHODS: Two formulations of mouthwash containing oral topical lidocaine 2% (viscous), diphenhydramine 2.5 mg/mL, and aluminum hydroxide-magnesium hydroxide-simethicone were prepared in 1:1:1 and 1:2.5:2.5 ratios, divided into 3-mL samples, and stored in unit-dose oral amber syringes. Unit-dose single-product lidocaine samples were also prepared to serve as controls and stored in oral amber syringes. The lidocaine concentrations in these samples were measured periodically for 90 days. A stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatographic method was developed and validated for system suitability, accuracy, repeatability, intermediate precision, specificity, linearity, and robustness. RESULTS: Based on the calculated percentages versus the initial concentration and the results from an analysis of variance comparing the two formulations, a BUD of 21 days is deemed appropriate for both magic mouthwash formulations. Based on the stability data, published safety concerns, and lack of efficacy in combination, packaging and dispensing lidocaine separately from other ingredients are recommended when administering magic mouthwash mixtures. Utilizing a 90-day BUD, lidocaine can be packaged separately from other magic mouthwash ingredients in individual dosage units and applied to the oral cavity using the swish-and-spit method. The delivery of the diphenhydramine and aluminum hydroxide-magnesium hydroxide-simethicone could be separated, allowing for a swish-and-swallow method of administration. CONCLUSION: A BUD of 21 days is recommended for lidocaine prepared with diphenhydramine and aluminum hydroxide-magnesium hydroxide-simethicone in ratios of 1:1:1 and 1:2.5:2.5 and stored at room temperature in amber oral plastic syringes.

"Abstract: Photodynamic therapy is emerging as a hopeful method for the treatment of oncological diseases. In the search of novel therapeutic strategies for colorectal cancer, in this work we reported the photocytotoxic activity of a lipophilic zinc(II) phthalocyanine on a murine colon adenocarcinoma cell line (CT26 cells). The 2,9(10),16(17),23(24) tetrakis[(2-dimethylamino)ethylsulfanyl]phthalocyaninatozinc(II), named Pc9, was encapsulated into Tetronic® 1107 polymeric poloxamine micelles (T1107) and assayed in 2D and 3D cell cultures. We showed that the formulation Pc9-T1107 was efficient to reduce cell viability after photodynamic treatment both in 2D cultures (IC "
"BACKGROUND: Accidental drug overdose is a common problem in young children. We examined the influence of formulation and dose in enquiries for different gastro-oesophageal reflux disease treatments in children under 5 years to the UK's National Poisons Information Service. METHODS: Overdose characteristics with ranitidine, omeprazole or domperidone were compared with those of metoclopramide and the H-1 antagonist chlorphenamine, for the period 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2015. RESULTS: There were a total of 1092 ranitidine, 618 domperidone and 1193 omeprazole cases; 669, 281 and 424, respectively, were single agent enquiries; of these 77% (517) of ranitidine, 52% (145) domperidone and 32% (135) omeprazole cases occurred in children <5 years. In comparison, 17% (34/424) of metoclopramide and 53% (533/1013) of chlorphenamine were <5 years; 79% (410/517) of ranitidine overdose enquiries in children <5 years were under 6 months of age, higher than domperidone (68/145, 47%; p < 0.05), omeprazole (8/135, 6%), chlorphenamine (13/553, 2%) or metoclopramide (1/34, 3%) (all p < 0.01). In children aged <6 months, 101 were 10-fold overdoses, 86 with ranitidine. CONCLUSIONS: Tenfold overdoses in children (<5 years) were a feature of ranitidine enquiries, likely due to the high concentration of the syrup. This has relevance to other liquid formulations used for non-licenced indications in young children. Such therapeutic errors cause significant carer anxiety and healthcare utilization. Assistance is needed from manufacturers and legislators in modifying formulation so that drugs can be safely used in young children. Education of prescribers and carers is also needed to reduce the incidence of such errors that cause significant carer anxiety and healthcare utilization. "
"BACKGROUND: In 2016, dermatologists in Finland suspected contact allergy in several patients using moisturizers under the trade name Apobase®. Following a formulation change, Phenostat™, which is a mixture of phenoxyethanol, caprylhydroxamic acid, and methylpropanediol, was used as a preservative in Apobase® moisturizers in Finland. OBJECTIVES: To confirm the suspected contact allergy to Apobase® cream, oily cream, and/or lotion, and to identify the specific contact allergen and define its optimal patch test concentration. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with suspected contact allergy to Apobase® creams or lotion were patch tested in four Finnish dermatological clinics. The patch tests included old and new Apobase® formulas and their preservative agents: phenoxyethanol, methylpropanediol, and dilution series of Phenostat™ and caprylhydroxamic acid or its potassium salt. RESULTS: The patch tests showed positive reactions to the new Apobase® formulas, Phenostat™, and caprylhydroxamic acid or its potassium salt, but not to the old Apobase® formulas, methylpropanediol, or phenoxyethanol. CONCLUSIONS: We found a new contact allergen, caprylhydroxyamic acid, which caused an epidemic of allergic contact dermatitis in patients using moisturizers containing this preservative. Whether the sensitizing capacity of caprylhydroxamic acid depends on the other chemicals used in Apobase® moisturizers needs further investigation. "
"Abstract: The present study was aimed to coencapsulate methotrexate (MTX) and aceclofenac (ACL) in fucose anchored lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (Fu-LPHNPs) to achieve target specific and controlled delivery for developing therapeutic interventions against breast cancer. The effective combination therapy requires coadministration of drugs to achieve synergistic effect on tumor with minimum adverse effects. Present study investigates the potential of codelivery of MTX and ACL through LPHNPs in MCF-7 and triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). We obtained LPHNPs in the nanosize range (<150 nm) with better particle size distribution (<0.3). The entrapment and loading efficiency of MTX and ACL was calculated as 85-90% and 10-12%, respectively. The coumarin-6 LPHNP formulations showed rapid internalization within 2 h incubation with MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. With 8-10 times, greater bioavailability of drug-loaded LPHNPs than free MTX and ACL was obtained. Also, antitumor efficacy of MTX- and ACL-loaded LPHNPs was determined on DMBA-induced experimental breast cancer mouse model. This model showed better control over tumor growth with MTX- and ACL-loaded LPHNPs than the combination of MTX and ACL or MTX alone. ACL-loaded LPHNPs showed prophylactic and anticancer activity in DMBA-induced mouse model at higher dose (10 mg/kg). ACL-LPHNPs confer synergistic anticancer effect when administered in combination with MTX. In conclusion, ACL enhances the therapeutic and anticancer efficacy of MTX, when coencapsulated into fucose-anchored LPHNPs, as confirmed by cell viability and serum angiogenesis (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, COX2, and MMP1) at both transcript and proteome level.

"Abstract: Topical agents, including retinoids and antibiotics, are commonly used to treat acne vulgaris (AV) and remain as components of acne treatment guidelines. Approved topical combination formulations offer the advantages of established efficacy, decreased frequency of application, and improved convenience for patients. This article discusses both clindamycin phosphate (CP) and tretinoin (Tret) as components of a topical aqueous-based combination gel that has been shown to be effective, safe, and well tolerated for treatment of facial AV. Clinically relevant considerations with use of this treatment are also discussed, including therapeutic advantages and potential limitations. "
"Abstract: The literature claims that incorporation of antioxidants into sunscreens provides additional skin photoprotection by scavenging free radicals formed due to sun radiation, but there are limited in vivo studies that support this hypothesis. This study aims to examine whether addition of antioxidants to a broad-spectrum sunscreen increases its photoprotective effect in real-use conditions. Sunscreen formulations composed of stable UV filters (Tinosorb® S, Tinosorb® M, Uvinul® APlus, and Uvinul® T150) alone or in combination with antioxidants (Spirulina and dimethylmethoxy chromanol-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles) were developed and their appearance, odor, rheological behavior, Sun Protection Factor (SPF), and UVA protection were analyzed. Next, it was conducted a 3-month, single-blind clinical study with 44 healthy subjects (30-50years). Before and 28, 54, and 84days after twice-daily self application of the sunscreens on the face, the stratum corneum water content, transepidermal water loss, dermis echogenicity, and skin elasticity and pigmentation were measured. At the end of the study period, the volunteers answered a questionnaire containing terms related to sensory characteristics of the formulations. All formulations were stable and exhibited non-Newtonian and pseudoplastic behavior, in vivo SPF 30, and good UVA protection. Antioxidant supplementation to the sunscreen formulation significantly improved the skin pigmentation, the collagen degradation on the dermis and thereby the skin net elasticity after 84days of treatment compared to the sunscreen alone. Concerning safety, all formulations were considered non-irritant according to the sensorial analyses, whose results agreed with the clinical study findings. "
"OBJECTIVE: To assess medical practices surrounding the use of topical ocular cyclosporine A across European Union nations. METHODS: Key stakeholders (ophthalmologists, hospital pharmacists, regulatory health authorities) from European Union member states were interviewed by telephone using a semi-structured, open-ended questionnaire. Ophthalmologists responded to questions about practice patterns of cyclosporine A use (prescription frequency, indication, dosage), pharmacists about cyclosporine A formulations (composition, manufacturing process, quality control, distribution), and the regulatory authorities about market authorization and pharmacovigilance for various cyclosporine A products. RESULTS: Over the years, cyclosporine A use for ophthalmic indications has increased across all European Union nations. Prevalence of cyclosporine A use was heterogeneous, with Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom reporting the highest frequency. Compounded cyclosporine A formulations and other cyclosporine A products were prescribed through temporary authorization on a compassionate use or named-patient basis. Cyclosporine A was prescribed for dry eye disease, atopic and vernal keratoconjunctivitis, corneal graft rejection, and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Concentrations of prescribed topical cyclosporine A ranged between 0.05-2% and formulations were instilled 1-6 times daily. Interviewed stakeholders expressed concern regarding, (1) paucity of product information, (2) lack of standardized manufacturing processes and quality control of cyclosporine A formulations, and (3) poor regulation and pharmacovigilance of ocular cyclosporine A-based products. CONCLUSIONS: Medical practice surrounding ocular cyclosporine A use in European Union nations differs based on variations in concentration, dosage, prescription indication, formulation, availability and distribution, manufacturing, quality, and regulatory monitoring.

"UNLABELLED: <p>Objective: To evaluate the speed of onset and duration of relief of two ceramide-containing formulations with 1% pramoxine hydroxide (CeraVe® Itch Relief Lotion and Cream,Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America LLC, Irvine, CA) in patients with atopic history, including those with active flare and the comparative efficacy of CeraVe Itch Relief Cream to hydrocortisone 1% cream and night-time itch relief with continued use. METHODS: Two double-blind, split-body, randomized studies in 66 male and female subjects, ages 11+ years, with history of atopic dermatitis (AD). Itch severity was assessed on a 10-point scale (where 0=none and 7-9=severe). Study one: single applications of ceramide-containing lotion or cream incorporating 1% pramoxine hydrochloride applied to opposite sides of the body. Study two (part 1): single application of ceramide-containing cream or hydrocortisone 1% cream. Study two (part 2): ceramide-containing pramoxine cream applied up to 4 times in a 24-hour period, over the course of 6 days. Itch relief assessed at baseline, 2, and 5 minutes, 1 (2 in study two), 4, and 8 hours post-application. Efficacy and aesthetic attributes were assessed at the same timepoints. Clinical evaluation of performance and mildness of the ceramide-containing 1% pramoxine hydrochloride cream at day 6 (study two, part 2). RESULTS: Study one: Relief of itching was rapid and long-lasting with significant reductions in severity after 2 minutes, and continued improvement over the 8 hour test period (P less than .001 versus baseline at all timepoints). Mean itch severity scores reduced progressively from 6 (moderate) at baseline to 1-2 (mild) after 8 hours, with all patients experiencing relief from itching. Rapid and long-lasting relief to dry, itchy, irritated skin was confirmed through patient self-assessment. Both lotion and cream formulations were non-greasy, absorbed quickly and easily, and were non-irritating. Study two: Ceramide-containing cream incorporating 1% pramoxine hydrochloride provided comparable improvement in itch relief (24.6% reduction in mean itch severity 2 minutes post-application, and 58.0% reduction 8 hours post-application) compared to hydrocortisone cream 1% (18.5% reduction and 59.7% reduction, respectively). Daily use of the ceramide-containing 1% pramoxine cream over 6-days provided all-night relief (87.5% agreement), and perception of skin looking and feeling healthier with each use (71.9% and 81.3% agreement, respectively). LIMITATIONS: Results of study one and subsequent comparative study with hydrocortisone 1% cream are based on a single application. There were no placebo controls. CONCLUSIONS: Ceramide-containing lotion or cream containing 1% pramoxine provides both rapid and long-lasting relief of itching following a single application in atopic patients with or without active flare. Both formulations were well tolerated with aesthetic appeal. Comparable itch relief to hydrocortisone 1% cream was seen with the ceramide-containing cream over an 8-hour period following a single application. Further ceramide-containing 1% pramoxine hydrochloride cream was well tolerated with continued use over 6 days, delivering comfort and all-night relief for patients with atopic history suffering from reoccurrant itching.</p> <p><em>J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(3):243-247.</em></p>.

"UNLABELLED: <p>BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated disease that varies widely in its clinical expression. Treatment options focus on relieving symptoms, reducing inflammation, induration, and scaling, and controlling the extent of the disease. Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment, however long-term safety remains a concern, particularly with the more potent formulations. Combination therapy with a corticosteroid and tazarotene may improve psoriasis signs at a lower corticosteroid concentration providing a superior safety profile. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of a once-daily application of a fixed combination halobetasol propionate 0.01% and tazarotene 0.045% (HP/TAZ) lotion in comparison with its monads and vehicle in subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. METHODS: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 2 study in moderate or severe psoriasis (N=212). Subjects randomized (2:2:2:1 ratio) to receive HP/TAZ, individual monads, or vehicle, once-daily for 8 weeks. Efficacy assessments included treatment success (defined as at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline in the IGA score and a score of 'Clear' or 'Almost Clear'), and impact on individual signs of psoriasis (erythema, plaque elevation, and scaling) at the target lesion. Safety and treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were evaluated throughout. RESULTS: HP/TAZ lotion demonstrated statistically significant superiority over vehicle as early as 2 weeks. At week 8, 52.5% of subjects had treatment success compared with 33.3%, 18.6%, and 9.7% in the HP (P=0.033), TAZ (P less than 0.001), and vehicle (P less than 0.001) groups, respectively. HP/TAZ lotion was superior to its monads and vehicle in reducing the psoriasis signs of erythema, plaque elevation, and scaling at the target lesion. At week 8, a 2-grade improvement in IGA was achieved by 54.2% of subjects for erythema, 67.8% for plaque elevation, and 64.4% for scaling. Most frequently reported TEAEs were application site reactions, and were more likely associated with the tazarotene component. Side effects such as skin atrophy were rare. CONCLUSIONS: HP/TAZ lotion was consistently more effective than its monads or vehicle in achieving treatment success and reducing psoriasis signs of erythema, plaque elevation, and scaling at the target lesion. Safety data were consistent with the known safety profile of halobetasol propionate and tazarotene, and did not reveal any new safety concerns with the combination product.</p> <p><em>J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(3):197-204.</em></p>.

"Abstract: UV radiation exposure is the major contributor to photocarcinogenesis and photoageing. Reducing UV radiation exposure can be achieved by using adequate sunscreen preparations. The use of sunscreen can significantly reduce the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma, actinic keratoses and invasive melanoma. In the Australian market over 900 sunscreen products are available, each with their own brand, formulation and ingredients. It can be difficult for dermatologists and consumers to determine which are the most effective and appropriate products to use. We discuss the specific active ingredients found in sunscreen formulations available in Australia, their mode of protection, photostability, solubility, and side-effects and the methods used by the Therapeutic Goods Administration to determine the ratings and efficacy of each sunscreen.

"BACKGROUND: Information is lacking on the dermal penetration of topically applied formulations on in vitro skin models, under conditions where the stratum corneum (SC) is damaged. Therefore, we have developed a standardized in vitro barrier-disrupted skin model using tape stripping. METHODS: Different tape stripping conditions were evaluated using histology, transepidermal water loss, infrared densitometry, and caffeine absorption. RESULTS: The effects of tape stripping were comparable using pig and human skin. Optimized conditions were used to test the effect of SC damage and UV irradiation on the absorption of an UV filter combination present in a sunscreen. The bioavailability of the filters was extremely low regardless of the extent of skin damage, suggesting bioavailability would not be increased if the consumer applied the sunscreen to sun-damaged skin. CONCLUSION: This standardized in vitro methodology using pig or human skin for damaged skin will add valuable information for the safety assessment of topically applied products. "
"Abstract: Recently, the unregulated use of untested synthetic alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) analogues, commonly known as melanotan I and II, appears to have increased. These analogues are primarily used for their tan-stimulating effects. Dermatologists see many patients in their clinic who tan. This review provides an overview of the risks of the unregulated use of these substances. Other topics discussed here include the history and safety of afamelanotide, which is the only α-MSH analogue that is approved for use in a limited number of medical indications. Although afamelanotide has been thoroughly tested and deemed safe, illegal melanotans are likely risky for several reasons. There are questions regarding the preparation, administration, and dosage of these substances. In addition to these general risks, increasing numbers of case reports indicate that the unregulated use of both melanotan I and II is associated with cutaneous complications, particularly melanocytic changes in existing moles and newly emerging (dysplastic) nevi. Four case reports have described melanomas emerging from existing moles either during or shortly after the use of melanotan. Although conclusive evidence linking these phenomena is lacking, publications have stressed the importance of awareness that melanotan is a part of a 'tanning culture' in certain subpopulations. Multiple national health organizations have issued safety warnings regarding the use of melanotan I and II. "
"Abstract: Dimethyl fumarate (DMF; trade name Tecfidera) is an oral formulation of the fumaric acid ester that is Food and Drug Administration approved for treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. To better understand the therapeutic effects of Tecfidera and its rare side effect of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, we conducted cross-sectional and longitudinal studies by immunophenotyping cells from peripheral blood (particularly T lymphocytes) derived from untreated and 4-6 and 18-26 mo Tecfidera-treated stable relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients using multiparametric flow cytometry. The absolute numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells were significantly decreased and the CD4/CD8 ratio was increased with DMF treatment. The proportions of both effector memory T cells and central memory T cells were reduced, whereas naive T cells increased in treated patients. T cell activation was reduced with DMF treatment, especially among effector memory T cells and effector memory RA T cells. Th subsets Th1 (CXCR3 "
"Abstract: To date, facial acne flare-ups in adult women during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle have been poorly investigated. To clinically characterize premenstrual acne flare-up in adult women and investigate the effect of a dermocosmetic treatment. This single-centre study included 32 young adult women with declared premenstrual acne flares and was composed of two phases: (1) an observational phase (two menstrual cycles) and (2) an interventional phase (one menstrual cycle) in a controlled, randomised, double-blind, intra-individual (half-face) setting in which a dermocosmetic (containing lipohydroxyacid, nicotinamide, and piroctone-olamine) and placebo were compared. Initially, during the first part of the study, we observed that premenstrual acne flare-ups in adult women were characterized by a significant increase in the number of papules (20.2 vs. 13.7; p = 0.0008) and to a lesser extent, closed comedones (25.6 vs. 22.7; p = 0.04). Secondly, during the interventional phase, the half-face treated with the dermocosmetic formulation showed a significantly lower number of inflammatory lesions (7.6 vs 9.4; p = 0.01) during the luteal phase compared to the half-face treated with the placebo. Tolerance of the dermocosmetic formulation was rated as good or excellent. Our data indicate a significant increase in the number of papules during premenstrual acne flare-ups in adult women and the use of a dermocosmetic may be of benefit in partially reducing this premenstrual inflammatory flare-up.

"Abstract: Bioactive food chemicals are substances present in food that are capable of interacting with living cells causing changes in physiological functions. Salicylic acid (SA), a plant hormone involved in plant immune response, is one such bioactive food chemical. Aspirin, a commercially available SA, might play beneficial roles in cardiovascular health and colon cancer. It may also cause urticaria, angioedema, asthma, and gastrointestinal symptoms in SA-sensitive individuals. Dietary SA might exert similar beneficial effects and/or may induce similar symptoms in hypersensitive individuals. Food-related SA sensitivity in relation to gastrointestinal symptoms is not well documented besides a few self-reported questionnaires and the knowledge that low doses of aspirin (equivalent of high dietary intake) can cause gastrointestinal injury. The only direct evidence that suggests benefits of reducing dietary SA was reported in asthmatic individuals. Although SA sensitivity in relation to gut symptoms in susceptible individuals is accepted by clinicians, the detection of this disease remains a challenge because of the complicated nature of dietary challenges and the risk of oral aspirin provocation tests in patients with severe hypersensitivity reactions. Given the non-IgE mediated nature of the disease, in vitro assays like basophil activation may have failed to produce reliable results. However, given the simplicity of this assay, further studies need to be formulated to firmly establish its reliability. Formulation of proper dietary strategies for symptom control is also impossible given the controversial and scant nature of the data on SA content of food. This issue needs to be resolved to formulate proper dietary strategies for effective symptom control. "
"PURPOSE: Neonates are particularly challenging to treat. A novel patented drug delivery device containing a rapidly disintegrating tablet held within a modified nipple shield (NSDS) was designed to deliver medication to infants during breastfeeding. However concerns exist around dermatological nipple tolerability with no pharmaceutical safety assessment guidance to study local tissue tolerance of the nipple and the areola. This is the first Slug Mucosal Irritation (SMI) study to evaluate irritancy potential of GRAS excipients commonly used to manufacture rapidly disintegrating immediate release solid oral dosage form METHODS: Zinc sulphate selected as the antidiarrheal model drug that reduces infant mortality, was blended with functional excipients at traditional levels [microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate]. Slugs were exposed to blends slurried in human breast milk to assess their stinging, itching or burning potential, using objective values such as mucus production to categorize irritation potency RESULTS: Presently an in vivo assay, previously validated for prediction of ocular and nasal irritation, was used as an alternative to vertebrate models to anticipate the potential maternal dermatological tolerability issues to NSDS tablet components. The excipients did not elicit irritancy. However, mild irritancy was observed when zinc sulphate was present in blends. CONCLUSION: These promising good tolerability results support the continued investigation of these excipients within NSDS rapidly disintegrating tablet formulations. Topical local tolerance effects being almost entirely limited to irritation, the slug assay potentially adds to the existing preformulation toolbox, and may sit in between the in vitro and existing in vivo assays.

"Abstract: Poor tumor penetration is a major challenge for the use of nanoparticles in anticancer therapy. Moreover, the inability to reach hypoxic tumor cells that are distant from blood vessels results in inadequate exposure to antitumor therapeutics and contributes to development of chemoresistance and increased metastasis. In the present study, we developed iRGD-modified nanoparticles for simultaneous tumor delivery of a photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) and hypoxia-activated prodrug tirapazamine (TPZ). The iRGD-modified nanoparticles loaded with ICG and TPZ showed significantly improved penetration in both 3D tumor spheroids in vitro and orthotopic breast tumors in vivo. ICG-mediated photodynamic therapy upon irradiation with a near-IR laser induced hypoxia, which activated antitumor activity of the codelivered TPZ for synergistic cell-killing effect. In vivo studies demonstrated that the nanoparticles could efficiently deliver the drug combination in 4T1 orthotopic tumors. Primary tumor growth and metastasis were effectively inhibited by the iRGD-modified combination nanoparticles with minimal side effects. The results also showed the anticancer benefits of codelivering ICG and TPZ in a single nanoparticle formulation in contrast to a mixture of nanoparticles containing individual drugs. The study demonstrates the benefits of combining tumor-penetrating nanoparticles with hypoxia-activated drug treatment and establishes a delivery platform for PDT and hypoxia-activated chemotherapy.

"Abstract: Exploration of efficient dual-drug nanohybrids, particularly those with high drug loading, specific targeting property, and long-termed stability, is of highly importance in cancer therapy. A pH-driven coprecipitation was performed in the aqueous phase to obtain a dual-drug nanoformulation, composed of 10-hydroxycamptothecine (HCPT) nanoneedles integrated with an exterior thin layer of the methotrexate (MTX)-chitosan conjugate. The high stability of nanohybrids in water and the targeting property provided by the MTX ingredient function synergistically to the prolonged and sustained drug release property in tumor tissues and the increased cellular uptake. The cytotoxicity test illustrates that dual-drug nanoneedles possess the remarkable killing ability to HeLa cells with the combination index at 0.33 ± 0.07. After cellular internalization, the release of both drug ingredients results in an excellent anticancer activity in vivo with the minimized adverse side effects. Design of a green approach to the carrier-free, dual-drug nanoformulations enables to develop emerging drug delivery systems for cancer diagnosis and treatment. "
"PURPOSE: Collagen cross-linking (CXL) is a commonly performed procedure to prevent the progression of keratoconus. Riboflavin is an essential part of the procedure, which facilitates both the cross-linking process and protection of intraocular structures. Dextran can be added to riboflavin to create an isotonic solution. This case report highlights the importance of compounding riboflavin with the correct dextran solution. METHODS: A retrospective case series. RESULTS: Six eyes of 4 male patients with keratoconus aged from 20 to 38 years underwent CXL with substitution of 20% dextran (T-500) with 20% dextran sulfate in a compounded riboflavin 0.1% solution. Postoperatively, persistent corneal epithelial defects, stromal haze, and then scarring occurred. Corneal transplantation was performed for visual rehabilitation but was complicated by graft rejection followed by failure (n = 1 eye), dehiscence (n = 4), cataract (n = 2), post-laser ablation haze (n = 1), and steroid-induced glaucoma (n = 2). The visual outcome was <6/18 in all 6 cases because of irregular astigmatism and stromal haze. Thinning, vascularization, and scarring of the residual host tissue were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Substitution of dextran (T-500) with dextran sulfate in riboflavin solutions during CXL results in loss of vision from permanent corneal opacity. Residual host changes may compromise the results of corneal transplantation. "

"Abstract: Sulfur mustard (SM) is a strong blistering, highly reactive, lipophilic chemical war agent that causes injury in different organs including the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract. The Eyes are especially susceptible to the consequences of SM poisoning because of the aqueous and mucosal nature of conjunctiva and cornea. DNA alkylation and depletion of glutathione, are the most important mechanisms of SM action in the eye injuries. Acute clinical symptoms are including decrease in visual acuity, dryness, photophobia, blepharospasm, conjunctivitis, and complaints of foreign body sensation and soreness that gradually progress to severe ocular pain. Corneal abrasions, ulcerations, vesication, and perforations are common corneal consequences in SM injured victims. Appearance of chronic symptoms has been reported as chronic inflammation of the corneal and conjunctival vasculature, ischemia, lipid and cholesterol deposition, scarring in cornea, corneal thinning, opacification and perforation of the cornea, limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), and neovascularization. Different medical and surgical protocols have been documented in the management of SM-induced ocular injuries, including preservative-free artificial tears, topical steroids and antibiotic, mydriatic, antiglaucoma drops, therapeutic contact lenses, dark glasses and punctal plugs/cauterization, N-acetylcysteine, tarsorrhaphy, amniotic membrane transplantation, stem cell transplantation, and corneal transplantation. New drugs such as resolvin E1, topical form of essential fatty acids, thymosin β4, 43 amino-acid polypeptides, topical form of curcumin, newly formulated artificial tears, diquafosol, rebamipide, tretinoin, and oral uridineseems to be beneficial in the management of ocular lesion associated with sulfur mustard poisoning. Further studies are needed to approve these drugs in SM victims. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 3549-3560, 2017. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. "
"BACKGROUND: This review is an update of 'Topical capsaicin (high concentration) for chronic neuropathic pain in adults' last updated in Issue 2, 2013. Topical creams with capsaicin are used to treat peripheral neuropathic pain. Following application to the skin, capsaicin causes enhanced sensitivity, followed by a period with reduced sensitivity and, after repeated applications, persistent desensitisation. High-concentration (8%) capsaicin patches were developed to increase the amount of capsaicin delivered; rapid delivery was thought to improve tolerability because cutaneous nociceptors are 'defunctionalised' quickly. The single application avoids noncompliance. Only the 8% patch formulation of capsaicin is available, with a capsaicin concentration about 100 times greater than conventional creams. High-concentration topical capsaicin is given as a single patch application to the affected part. It must be applied under highly controlled conditions, often following local anaesthetic, due to the initial intense burning sensation it causes. The benefits are expected to last for about 12 weeks, when another application might be made. OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of topically applied, high-concentration (8%) capsaicin in chronic neuropathic pain in adults. SEARCH METHODS: For this update, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two clinical trials registries, and a pharmaceutical company's website to 10 June 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of at least 6 weeks' duration, using high-concentration (5% or more) topical capsaicin to treat neuropathic pain. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently searched for studies, extracted efficacy and adverse event data, and examined issues of study quality and potential bias. Where pooled analysis was possible, we used dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio and numbers needed to treat for one additional event, using standard methods.Efficacy outcomes reflecting long-duration pain relief after a single drug application were from the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) at specific points, usually 8 and 12 weeks. We also assessed average pain scores over weeks 2 to 8 and 2 to 12 and the number of participants with pain intensity reduction of at least 30% or at least 50% over baseline, and information on adverse events and withdrawals.We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight studies, involving 2488 participants, two more studies and 415 more participants than the previous version of this review. Studies were of generally good methodological quality; we judged only one study at high risk of bias, due to small size. Two studies used a placebo control and six used 0.04% topical capsaicin as an 'active' placebo to help maintain blinding. Efficacy outcomes were inconsistently reported, resulting in analyses for most outcomes being based on less than complete data.For postherpetic neuralgia, we found four studies (1272 participants). At both 8 and 12 weeks about 10% more participants reported themselves much or very much improved with high-concentration capsaicin than with 'active' placebo, with point estimates of numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTs) of 8.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.3 to 26) with high-concentration capsaicin and 7.0 (95% CI 4.6 to 15) with 'active' placebo (2 studies, 571 participants; moderate quality evidence). More participants (about 10%) had average 2 to 8-week and 2 to 12-week pain intensity reductions over baseline of at least 30% and at least 50% with capsaicin than control, with NNT values between 10 and 12 (2 to 4 studies, 571 to 1272 participants; very low quality evidence).For painful HIV-neuropathy, we found two studies (801 participants). One study reported the proportion of participants who were much or very much improved at 12 weeks (27% with high-concentration capsaicin and 10% with 'active' placebo). For both studies, more participants (about 10%) had average 2 to 12-week pain intensity reductions over baseline of at least 30% with capsaicin than control, with an NNT of 11 (very low quality evidence).For peripheral diabetic neuropathy, we found one study (369 participants). It reported about 10% more participants who were much or very much improved at 8 and 12 weeks. One small study of 46 participants with persistent pain following inguinal herniorrhaphy did not show a difference between capsaicin and placebo for pain reduction (very low quality evidence).We downgraded the quality of the evidence for efficacy outcomes by one to three levels due to sparse data, imprecision, possible effects of imputation methods, and susceptibility to publication bias.Local adverse events were common, but not consistently reported. Serious adverse events were no more common with active treatment (3.5%) than control (3.2%). Adverse event withdrawals did not differ between groups, but lack of efficacy withdrawals were somewhat more common with control than active treatment, based on small numbers of events (six to eight studies, 21 to 67 events; moderate quality evidence, downgraded due to few events). No deaths were judged to be related to study medication. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: High-concentration topical capsaicin used to treat postherpetic neuralgia, HIV-neuropathy, and painful diabetic neuropathy generated more participants with moderate or substantial levels of pain relief than control treatment using a much lower concentration of capsaicin. These results should be interpreted with caution as the quality of the evidence was moderate or very low. The additional proportion who benefited over control was not large, but for those who did obtain high levels of pain relief, there were usually additional improvements in sleep, fatigue, depression, and quality of life. High-concentration topical capsaicin is similar in its effects to other therapies for chronic pain. "
"OBJECTIVE: To develop recommendations for the use of parenteral methotrexate (MTX) in rheumatic diseases, mainly rheumatoid arthritis, based on best evidence and experience. METHODS: A group of 21 experts on parenteral MTX use was selected. The coordinator formulated 13 questions about parenteral MTX (indications, efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness). A systematic review was conducted to answer the questions. Using this information, inclusion and exclusion criteria were established, as were the search strategies (involving Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library). Three different reviewers selected the articles. Evidence tables were created. Abstracts from the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) were evaluated. Based on this evidence, the coordinator proposed preliminary recommendations that the experts discussed and voted in a nominal group meeting. The level of evidence and grade of recommendation were established using the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine and the level of agreement with the Delphi technique (2 rounds). Agreement was established if at least 80% of the experts voted yes (yes/no). RESULTS: Most of the evidence involved rheumatoid arthritis. A total of 13 preliminary recommendations on the use of parenteral MTX were proposed; 11 of them were accepted. Two of the 13 were not voted and are commented on in the main text. CONCLUSIONS: The manuscript aims to solve frequent questions and help in decision-making strategies when treating patients with parenteral MTX. "
"BACKGROUND: Drugs that exhibit close margins between therapeutic and toxic blood concentrations are considered to have a narrow therapeutic index (NTI). The Food and Drug Administration has proposed that NTI drugs should have more stringent bioequivalence standards for approval of generic formulations. However, many immunosuppressant drugs do not have a well-defined therapeutic index (TI). METHODS: We sought to determine whether safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic data obtained from the medical literature through a comprehensive literature search could be used to estimate the TI of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and sirolimus. In this analysis, we considered TI ≤2 as a criterion to define a drug as having an NTI. RESULTS: Published literature indicates that cyclosporine has a TI of 2-3, which falls just short of our criteria to be classified as having an NTI. We found sirolimus and tacrolimus to have a therapeutic range of 5-12 ng/mL and of 5-20 ng/mL, respectively, but were unable to calculate the TI. CONCLUSIONS: Although the current literature does not provide a clear indication that these drugs have an NTI, the routine use of therapeutic drug monitoring in clinical practice suggests that more stringent testing of their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties should be performed before the approval of generic formulations.

"CONTEXT: The prevalence of sensitive skin among the general population in industrialized countries is reported to be over 50%. Sensitive skin subjects often report significant reactions to contact with cosmetics, soaps and other consumer products. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the overall skin compatibility and mildness program for a newly developed, lightly fragranced, colorant free laundry product (i.e. Arm & Hammer™ Sensitive Skin plus Skin-Friendly Fresh Scent), specially formulated for individuals with sensitive skin. The skin mildness of the product was compared to Arm & Hammer™ Free & Clear liquid laundry detergent with no fragrance or colorant, and an established history of safe use by sensitive skin consumers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The test material was a liquid laundry product with a light scent formulated for sensitive skin consumers (Arm & Hammer™ Sensitive Skin plus Skin-Friendly Fresh Scent). The product was compared to commercially marketed products for sensitive skin with a history of skin safety in the marketplace, including: a very similar product formulation (Arm & Hammer™ Free & Clear with no fragrance), and several selected competitors' products. Studies were conducted among individuals with self-assessed sensitive skin (based on a questionnaire) using standard protocols for the Human Repeat Insult Patch Test (HRIPT), 10-Day Cumulative Irritation, the Wrist Band Wear test, and the Safety In-Use testing. Responses in all protocols were evaluated by visual scoring of potential dermatologic reactions, and recording any sensory effects at the time of the examination. In addition, sensory effects collected from panelists' daily diaries were also evaluated. RESULTS: The HRIPT confirmed that neither the fragrance alone, nor the product formulation with fragrance, induced contact sensitization in sensitive skin subjects. The 10-Day cumulative irritation study conducted using sensitive skin subjects showed highly favorable skin compatibility, and the test product was comparable to the control product (Arm & Hammer Free & Clear) and other nonirritant controls. In the Wrist Band Wear test, exposure to laundered fabrics under exaggerated conditions gave similar results for the test and control products, with no objective signs of skin irritation, and no self-reported persistent adverse sensory effects. Very mild, transient and isolated sensory effects were noted in daily diaries by a small proportion of subjects, and were similar for the test and control products. The Safety In-Use tests evaluated 4-week exposure to product and laundered fabrics under realistic use conditions. There were no clinically objective signs of skin irritation, and reports of transitory, mild sensory effects were minimal and similar for the test and controls. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: A comprehensive skin safety program on a lightly scented sensitive skin laundry formulation (i.e. Arm & Hammer™ Sensitive Skin plus Skin-Friendly Fresh Scent) conducted among panels of self-assessed sensitive skin subjects demonstrated that the presence of a light fragrance did not adversely impact skin compatibility in any of the testing protocols when the product was compared to a similar product with no fragrance. The lightly fragranced product demonstrated overall skin compatibility and mildness when tested in a self-assessed sensitive skin population, and compared favorably to currently marketed sensitive skin products.

"Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) combines light with photosensitizers (PS) for production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can kill infectious microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and protozoa. The application of nanotechnology has enabled the advancement of PDT because many PS are insoluble in water, necessitating a nanocarrier as a physiologically acceptable carrier. Nanoemulsions are efficient nanocarriers for solubilizing liposoluble drugs, like the PS, in water. Cutaneous (CL) and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (ML) are caused by different species of the genus Leishmania, transmitted to humans by sandfly bites. Parasites are hosted in skin macrophages producing ulcerative lesions. Thus, a topical treatment, effective and inexpensive, for CL and ML is preferable to systemic interventions. There are topical treatments like paromomycin and amphotericin B, but they have many local side effects or a very high cost, limiting their use. This work aimed to develop a zinc phthalocyanine (photosensitizer) oil-in-water nanoemulsion, essential clove oil and polymeric surfactant (Pluronic "
"Abstract: Afamelanotide, the first α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) analogue, synthesized in 1980, was broadly investigated in all aspects of pigmentation because its activity and stability were higher than the natural hormone. Afamelanotide binds to the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), and MC1R signaling increases melanin synthesis, induces antioxidant activities, enhances DNA repair processes and modulates inflammation. The loss-of-function variants of the MC1R present in fair-skinned Caucasians are less effectively activated by the natural hormone. Afamelanotide was the first α-MSH analogue to be applied to human volunteers. Ten daily doses of between 0.08 and 0.21 mg/kg in saline injected subcutaneously resulted in long-lasting skin pigmentation and enabled basic pharmacokinetics. Subcutaneous application had full bioavailability, but neither oral nor transdermal application resulted in measurable plasma concentrations or pigmentation response. Two trials in human volunteers showed that neither MC1R variants nor fair skin reduced the afamelanotide-induced increase in skin pigmentation. A controlled-release formulation optimizes administration in man and is effective at a lower dose than the daily saline injections. Promising therapeutic results were published in polymorphic light eruption, erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), solar urticaria, Hailey-Hailey disease and vitiligo. In 2014, afamelanotide was approved by the European Medicines Agency for the prevention of phototoxicity in adult patients with EPP. No late effects were reported in volunteers 25 years after the first exposure or after continuous long-term application of up to 8 years in EPP patients, and an immunogenic potential has been excluded. Generally, adverse effects were benign in all trials. "
"BACKGROUND: 5% minoxidil solution is approved for the treatment of male androgenetic alopecia (AGA). However, there have been occasional reports of adverse events that were caused mostly by propylene glycol sensitivity. As an alternative treatment, Siriraj hair team developed a proprietary preparation referred to as “minoxidil milky lotion” that uses butylene glycol as a substitute for propylene glycol. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of 5% minoxidil solution with 5% minoxidil milky lotion in the treatment of male AGA. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Twenty males with AGA were recruited for this prospective randomized study. Subjects were randomly treated with 5% minoxidil solution or 5% minoxidil milky lotion. Clinical outcomes and adverse events were recorded at 8, 16, and 24 weeks. RESULTS: The mean age of subjects was 43.5±12.5 years (range, 26-65 years). Percentage increase in hair density at 8 weeks after receiving 5% minoxidil solution and 5% minoxidil milky lotion was 8.8% and 37.4%, respectively (p = 0.01). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two preparations at the 16 and 24 week visits. Mild irritation was reported in 1 case in the 5% minoxidil milky lotion group. STUDY LIMITATION: Small sample size. CONCLUSION: Both formulations were found to be effective and safe in the treatment of male AGA. 5% minoxidil milky lotion may be an alternative treatment in propylene glycol-sensitive patients, with efficacy that is comparable to that of 5% minoxidil solution.

"SCOPE: A bolus administration of 0.15 mg nonivamide has previously been demonstrated to reduce energy intake in moderately overweight men. This 12-week intervention investigated whether a daily consumption of nonivamide in a protein-based product formulation promotes a reduction in body weight in healthy overweight subjects and affects outcome measures associated with mechanisms regulating food intake, e.g. plasma concentrations of (an)orexigenic hormones, energy substrates as well as changes in fecal microbiota. METHODS AND RESULTS: Nineteen overweight subjects were randomly assigned to either a control (C) or a nonivamide (NV) group. Changes in the body composition and plasma concentrations of satiating hormones were determined at fasting and 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after a glucose load. Participants were instructed to consume 0.15 mg nonivamide per day in 450 mL of a milk shake additionally to their habitual diet. After treatment, a group difference in body fat mass change (-0.61 ± 0.36% in NV and +1.36 ± 0.38% in C) and an increase in postprandial plasma serotonin were demonstrated. Plasma metabolome and fecal microbiome read outs were not affected. CONCLUSIONS: A daily intake of 0.15 mg nonivamide helps to support to maintain a healthy body composition. "
"Abstract: Mosquito-borne disease is an annual problem in Australia, with endemic pathogens such as Ross River virus infecting thousands of people each year. The recent emergence of Zika virus in South America and the Pacific, together with ongoing outbreaks of dengue viruses in Southeast Asia, generated great community interest in the most effective strategies to avoid mosquito bites. Large-scale mosquito control programs are not common in Australia and are limited in New South Wales (NSW). The use of topical insect repellents is a key recommendation by health authorities to prevent mosquito-borne disease. All products sold in Australia purporting to repel mosquitoes must be registered with the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority. Despite around 100 commercial products registered as repelling mosquitoes, there are relatively few active ingredients used across these formulations. The most common are diethyltoluamide (DEET), picaridin, p-menthane-3,8-diol (PMD) and a range of plant-derived products (e.g. melaleuca, eucalyptus, citronella oils). Research has shown that each of these active ingredients varies in the duration of protection provided against biting mosquitoes. Recommendations by health authorities are informed by this research, but inconsistencies between recommendations and available repellent formulations and their concentration of active ingredients can cause confusion in the community. There are conflicts between the data resulting from scholarly research, marketing promotion by manufacturers and recommendations provided by overseas health authorities. A review was undertaken of NSW Health's current recommendations on choosing and using insect repellents, taking into consideration recent research and currently registered topical repellents. "
"Abstract: Current osteosarcoma therapies cause severe treatment-related side effects and chemoresistance, and have low success rates. Consequently, alternative treatment options are urgently needed. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a minimally invasive, local therapy with proven clinical efficacy for a variety of tumor types. PDT is cytotoxic, provokes anti-vascular effects and stimulates tumor cell targeting mechanisms of the immune system and, consequently, has potential as a novel therapy for osteosarcoma patients. This study investigated the uptake and the dark- and phototoxicity and cytotoxic mechanisms of the photosensitizer (PS) 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(meta-hydroxyphenyl) chlorine (mTHPC, Foscan) and a liposomal mTHPC formulation (Foslip) in the human 143B and a mouse K7M2-derived osteosaroma cell line (K7M2L2) in vitro. Second, the tumor- and metastasis-suppressive efficacies of mTHPC formulations based PDT and associated mechanisms in intratibial, metastasizing osteosarcoma mouse models (143B/SCID and syngeneic K7M2L2/BALB/c) were studied. The uptake of Foscan and Foslip in vitro was time- and dose-dependent and resulted in mTHPC and light dose-dependent phototoxicity associated with apoptosis. In vivo, the uptake of both i.v. administered mTHPC formulations was higher in tumor than in healthy control tissue. PDT caused significant (Foscan p < 0.05, Foslip p < 0.001) tumor growth inhibition in both models. A significant (Foscan p < 0.001, Foslip p < 0.001) immune system-dependent suppression of lung metastasis was only observed in the K7M2L2/BALB/c model and was associated with a marked infiltration of T-lymphocytes at the primary tumor site. In conclusion, mTHPC-based PDT is effective in clinically relevant experimental osteosarcoma and suppresses lung metastasis in immunocompetent mice with beneficial effects of the liposomal mTHPC formulation Foslip.

"OBJECTIVE: Evaluate systemic exposure with repeated topical application of a fixed-combination topical gel product containing 1% diclofenac sodium and 3% menthol in either of 2 formulation packages relative to oral administration. METHODS: In this phase 1, single-center, 4-way crossover study, healthy volunteers aged 18 - 50 years underwent consecutive 3-day treatment regimens in a randomly assigned sequence with each of 4 treatment groups: 4 g of topical 1% diclofenac + 3% menthol gel administered via an aluminum tube or roll-on device applied 4 times daily; 4 g of topical 1% diclofenac sodium gel (Voltaren Gel) applied 4 times daily; and oral diclofenac sodium tablets 50 mg 3 times daily. Treatment regimens were separated by 2-day washout periods. RESULTS: A total of 18 subjects enrolled and completed the study. Relative to oral administration, area under the concentration time curve from 48 to 72 hours (AUC CONCLUSION: As expected, systemic exposure was significantly lower with the topical diclofenac/menthol treatment regimens compared with oral diclofenac. Local skin AEs were increased with the topical combination product, but the risk of systemic AEs was low. . "
"Abstract: Treating plantar, periungual, and external genital warts can be challenging. A prospective study from four centers in Italy evaluated 37 immunocompetent patients with single or multiple warts and treated each lesion with a nitric-zinc topical solution composed of organic and inorganic acids meant to devitalize tissue and destroy HPV DNA in infected keratinocytes. Thirty of the 37 patients had external genital warts, two had plantar warts, two had palm and finger warts, and three had subungual warts for a total of 55 lesions treated. Nitric-zinc aqueous solution was applied over each wart utilizing a 30 µL capillary tube until a whitening response was observed. Additional applications as needed were accomplished at 2-week intervals until the wart was gone. In those with hand, plantar, and subungual warts, there was a 100% clearance after two to three sessions. Three with external genital warts had only a partial response and one no benefit after four applications. Thus, this approach was effective in external genital and other ""difficult-to-treat"" warts in 90% of patients after one to four applications. It also was easy to use with no adverse events noted.

"Abstract: Phase I, randomized, controlled patch studies were conducted to evaluate skin sensitization and irritation potential of a new gel formulation containing 1% diclofenac and 3% menthol as a fixed-combination product.In study A, healthy volunteers were exposed to 4 test patches containing 1% diclofenac+3% menthol, diclofenac, menthol, or placebo gels during an induction (nine 48 to 72-h applications) and challenge phase (one 48-h application). Some subjects were re-challenged to evaluate suspected sensitization. Study B participants underwent 21 consecutive 24-h patch applications of the 4 treatments from study A, 0.2% sodium lauryl sulfate (positive control), 0.9% saline, and a marketed gel (1% diclofenac, Voltaren). Application sites were visually scored by blinded observers for skin sensitization/irritation.In study A, 77% of participants showed minimal erythema and signs of glazing and peeling with 1% diclofenac+3% menthol by the end of the induction phase, which diminished during the challenge phase. Similar patterns were seen with menthol gel. Only 1 subject exhibited possible sensitization to 1% diclofenac+3% menthol. In study B, mean cumulative irritation score with 1% diclofenac+3% menthol was significantly higher ( "
"BACKGROUND: The constant exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) has a variety of harmful effects on human health. Although synthetic sunscreen products have been introduced as a preventive/therapeutic strategy, with the realization of their adverse side effects, the recent trend is to search for human friendly alternative formulations especially of plant origin. Therefore, the present study focuses on evaluation of photoprotective activity of aqueous extracts (1 mg/ml) of eleven medicinal plants in Sri Lanka that have been widely employed in traditional medicine as treatment options for various skin diseases and to improve the complexion. METHODS: For the determination of UV filtering potential of the extracts, UV absorption was measured and the sun protection factor (SPF) was calculated according the Mansur equation. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by DPPH and ABTS assays. RESULTS: Among the extracts, Atalantia ceylanica, Hibiscus furcatus, Leucas zeylanica, Mollugo cerviana, Olax zeylanica and Ophiorrhiza mungos have displayed SPF value ≥ 25, which are even higher than two commercial photoprotective creams used as reference compounds. L. zeylanica and O. mungos have displayed a high UV absorbance in 260-350 nm range indicating their potential of being broad spectrum sunscreens. In addition, the extract of O. mungos was found to be photostable, without any significant reduction in the SPF after exposure to direct solar radiation for 21 days. DPPH assay and the ABTS assay revealed that the extracts possess high antioxidant activity. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study suggest that the presence of secondary metabolites with antioxidant property could be responsible for the high UV absorbance. Our findings would offer an exciting avenue for further research towards the development of herbal cosmetics. "

"BACKGROUND: A poloxamer solution acting as a vehicle for the lipid base particulate system (cubosome dispersions) containing alpha lipoic acid (ALA) has achieved encouraging results in skin aging. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the efficacy of 5% Cubosomal ALA as an anti-aging formulation. METHODS: This single-blinded, placebo-controlled, comparative study was conducted on 20 females. Patients were instructed to apply a gel formulation containing the active ingredient over the right half of their face and a placebo gel on the left half twice daily for 6 months. Global aesthetic improvement scale (GAIS) was utilized as a measure of clinical progress. The thicknesses of the epidermis and dermis were assessed before and after treatment using an ultrasound biomicroscope. RESULTS: The GAIS score assessment at 3 and 6 months showed a significantly greater improvement on the right sides in comparison with the left sides. At the end of the treatment period, the mean epidermal thickness significantly increased on the right side in comparison with the left side and the mean dermal thickness increased more on the right side in comparison with the left side; however, this difference was not significant. CONCLUSION: 5% Cubosomal ALA is an effective and safe modality for improving aging face. "
"Abstract: Encapsulation of more than one active pharmaceutical ingredient into nanocarriers such as liposomes is an attractive approach to achieve a synergic drug effect and less complicated dosing schedules in multi-drug treatment regimes. Liposomal drug delivery in acne treatment may improve drug efficiency by targeted delivery to pilosebaceous units, reduce adverse effects and improve patient compliance. We therefore aimed to co-encapsulate benzoyl peroxide (BPO) and chloramphenicol (CAM) into liposomes using the novel liposome processing method - dual asymmetric centrifugation (DAC). Liposomes were formed from soybean lecithin, propylene glycol and distilled water (2:1:2w/v/v ratio), forming a viscous liposome dispersion. Liposomes containing both drugs (BPO-CAM-Lip), single drug (BPO-Lip and CAM-Lip), and empty liposomes were prepared. Drug entrapment of BPO and CAM was determined by a newly developed HPLC method for simultaneous detection and quantification of both drugs. Encapsulation of around 50% for BPO and 60% for CAM respectively was obtained in both single-drug encapsulated formulations (BPO-Lip and CAM-Lip) and co-encapsulated formulations (BPO-CAM-Lip). Liposome sizes were comparable for all liposome formulations, ranging from 130 to 150nm mean diameter, with a polydispersity index <0.2 for all formulations. CAM exhibited a sustained release from all liposomal formulations, whereas BPO appeared retained within the liposomes. BPO retention could be attributed to its poor solubility. However, HaCaT cell toxicity was found dependent on BPO released from the liposomes. In the higher concentration range (4%v/v), liposomal formulations were less cytotoxic than the corresponding drug solutions used as reference. We have demonstrated that DAC is a fast, easy, suitable method for encapsulation of more than one drug within the same liposomes. "
"BACKGROUND: Incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) is one of the most common skin problems in adults who are incontinent for urine, stool, or both. In practice, products and procedures are the same for both prevention and treatment of IAD. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of various products and procedures to preventand treat incontinence-associated dermatitis in adults. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 28 September 2016). Additionally we searched other electronic databases: CENTRAL(2015, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1946 to May Week 3 2015), MEDLINE In-Process (inception to 26 May 2015), CINAHL(December 1981 to 28 May 2015), Web of Science (WoS; inception to 28 May 2015) and handsearched conference proceedings (to June 2015) and the reference lists of relevant articles, and contacted authors and experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, performed in any healthcare setting, with included participants over 18 years of age, with or without IAD. We included trials comparing the (cost) effectiveness of topical skin care products such as skin cleansers, moisturisers, and skin protectants of different compositions and skin care procedures aiming to prevent and treat IAD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full-texts, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of the included trials. MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 trials with 1295 participants in a qualitative synthesis. Participants were incontinent for urine, stool, or both, and were residents in a nursing home or were hospitalised.Eleven trials had a small sample size and short follow-up periods. .The overall risk of bias in the included studies was high. The data were not suitable for meta-analysis due to heterogeneity in participant population, skin care products, skin care procedures, outcomes, and measurement tools.Nine trials compared different topical skin care products, including a combination of products. Two trials tested a structured skin care procedure. One trial compared topical skin care products alongside frequencies of application. One trial compared frequencies of application of topical skin care products.We found evidence in two trials, being of low and moderate quality, that soap and water performed poorly in the prevention and treatment of IAD (primary outcomes of this review). The first trial indicated that the use of a skin cleanser might be more effective than the use of soap and water (risk ratio (RR) 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.87; low quality evidence). The second trial indicated that a structured skin care procedure, being a washcloth with cleansing, moisturising, and protecting properties, might be more effective than soap and water (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.79; moderate quality evidence). Findings from the other trials, all being of low to very low quality, suggest that applying a leave-on product (moisturiser, skin protectant, or a combination) might be more effective than not applying a leave-on product. No trial reported on the third primary outcome 'number of participants not satisfied with treatment' or on adverse effects. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Little evidence, of very low to moderate quality, exists on the effects of interventions for preventing and treating IAD in adults. Soap and water performed poorly in the prevention and treatment of IAD. Application of leave-on products (moisturisers, skin protectants, or a combination) and avoiding soap seems to be more effective than withholding these products. The performance of leave-on products depends on the combination of ingredients, the overall formulation and the usage (e.g. amount applied). High quality confirmatory trials using standardised, and comparable prevention and treatment regimens in different settings/regions are required. Furthermore, to increase the comparability of trial results, we recommend the development of a core outcome set, including validated measurement tools. The evidence in this review is current up to 28 September 2016. "
"Abstract: All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is an anti-tumor compound, exerting different anti-cancer effects on different types of cancer cells. Unfortunately, retinoids are also characterized by certain side effects following systemic administration, such as the burning of skin and general malaise. The highly variable degree of bioavailability of ATRA plus its tendency to induce its own destruction through metabolic degradation following oral treatment necessitate the development of alternative formulations. The aim of this work is to evaluate the physico-chemical properties of unilamellar, ATRA-containing liposomes and to investigate the cytotoxic activity of this potential nanomedicine on human thyroid carcinoma cells. Liposomes made up of DPPC/Chol/DSPE-mPEG2000 (6:3:1 molar ratio), characterized by a mean diameter of ∼200nm, a polydispersity index of 0.1 and a negative surface charge, were used as ATRA-carriers and their antiproliferative efficacy was investigated in comparison with the free drug on three different human thyroid carcinoma cell lines (PTC-1, B-CPAP, and FRO) through MTT-testing. The liposomes protected the ATRA against photodegradation and increased its antiproliferative properties due to the improvement of its cellular uptake. ATRA-loaded liposomes could be a novel formulation useful for the treatment of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. "
"Abstract: Cigarette smoking has been associated with multiple negative effects on human skin. Long-term physiological effects of cigarette smoke are through chronic and not acute exposure. Molecular alterations due to chronic exposure to cigarette smoke remain unclear. Primary human skin keratinocytes chronically exposed to cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) showed a decreased wound-healing capacity with an increased expression of NRF2 and MMP9. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified 4728 proteins, of which 105 proteins were overexpressed (≥2-fold) and 41 proteins were downregulated (≤2-fold) in primary skin keratinocytes chronically exposed to CSC. We observed an alteration in the expression of several proteins involved in maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity, including keratin 80 (5.3 fold, p value 2.5 × 10 "

"Abstract: Psoriasis is an autoimmune skin disorder characterized by hyper proliferation and poor differentiation of keratinocytes. It significantly affects patient's quality of life. This study reports the anti-psoriatic efficacy of tacrolimus and curcumin loaded liposphere gel formulation. Poor solubility, poor skin penetration and erratic absorption are some problems associated with the topical delivery of these drugs. To overcome these problems, lipospheres containing combination of tacrolimus and curcumin was prepared with a particle size of nearly 50nm and incorporated into a gel for topical application. Liposphere gel showed slow release of both the drugs and shear thinning behaviour that is desirable property of topical formulation. Further, dermal distribution study using dye loaded formulation suggested penetration of dye into skin layers. The therapeutic efficacy of tacrolimus and curcumin loaded liposphere gel was assessed on imiquimod induced psoriatic plaque model, and the level of expression of psoriatic biochemical markers was evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results indicated improvement in the phenotypic and histopathological features of psoriatic skin treated with tacrolimus and curcumin loaded liposphere gel. There was reduction in the level of TNF-α, IL-17 and IL-22 compared to imiquimod group. These results corroborate the premise that liposphere gel containing combination of tacrolimus and curcumin can be an effective strategy for the treatment of psoriasis. "

"Abstract: Cyclosporine A (CsA) is known as a neuroprotective agent against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in animal models. However, the significant therapeutic effects of CsA have been observed in high systemic doses or manipulating the blood-brain barrier, resulting in systemic side effects and toxicity. As the liposome nanocarriers have been developed for efficient delivery of peptide and proteins, liposomal CsA (Lipo-CsA) could improve cerebral (I/R) injuries. In this study, the liposomal CsA formulation (CsA at dose of 2.5 mg/kg) was prepared to assess the brain injury outcomes in 90 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) stroke model followed by 48 h reperfusion in treating rats. Five minutes after induction of cerebral ischemia in rats, intravenous (iv) administration of Lipo-CsA significantly (P < 0.001) recovered the infarct size, the brain edema, and the neurological activities compared to corresponding control groups following 48 h I/R. In addition, after 48 h cerebral I/R, Lipo-CsA potentially (P < 0.001) inhibited the inflammation responses including MPO activity and tumor necrosis factor-alpha level in comparison to other groups. In conclusion, the results indicate that the low dose of CsA in liposomal formulation is more effective compared to higher dose of free form of CsA in treatment of ischemic brain in rats. "
BACKGROUND: Preventing relapses of atopic dermatitis (AD) through the regular use of topical products to repair the skin barrier defect is an emerging concept. It is still unclear if some commonly used emollients exert a positive effect on the skin barrier. OBJECTIVES: To determine the skin barrier effects of emollients commonly prescribed in the U.K. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two cohorts of volunteers with quiescent AD undertook observer-blind forearm-controlled studies. The first cohort (18 volunteers) treated the volar side of one forearm with two fingertip units of Doublebase RESULTS: Neither Diprobase CONCLUSIONS: Diprobase 
"AIMS: To investigate the area under the curve (AUC) of mycophenolic acid (MPA) in adult Chinese renal allograft recipients receiving concomitant enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) and cyclosporine (CsA) during the early post-transplant phase and to develop optimal model equations for estimation of the MPA area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC METHODS: The present study enrolled 24 Chinese renal recipients treated with EC-MPS, CsA, and corticosteroid, from whom 24 serial blood samples were collected over 12 hours. MPA concentration was evaluated with enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT). LSS was developed by multiple stepwise regression analysis using a two-group method (test group, n = 12; and validation group, n = 12). RESULTS: The MPA predose concentration had a poor correlation with MPA AUC CONCLUSION: An LSS using time points at 1.5, 2, and 4 hours or 0.5, 1.5, 2, and 4 hours provides the most accurate and reliable estimation of the MPA AUC "
"Abstract: The aim of present study was to determine the effect of newly formulated gels and suspensions of extractive Phytoconstituents of Woodfordia fructicosa flowers and Gardenia gummifera leaves by using UV Radiation induced psoriasis in rats. Both plants are traditionally claimed to be useful in treatment of number of skin diseases. However, there are no established scientific reports for their potential in psoriasis. Formulated Gels and Suspensions of ethanolic extract of both plants were tested for acute dermal and oral toxicity study respectively. The results of acute dermal toxicity at concentration 1% w/w and oral toxicity at dose 1000mg/kg showed that the gels and suspensions were safe. Psoriasis was induced in Wistar rats by espousing 10% area of total body by UV radiations. Anti-psoriatic activity was performed by applying 0.1% gel and orally at a dose 100mg/kg body weight in rats. Severity Index, histological study and biochemical estimation were analyzed. The results of our studies showed that the test formulations (Gels and Suspensions) of both plant extracts exhibited potential effect in anti-psoriatic activity. "
"Abstract: Psoralen in combination with ultraviolet A radiation (PUVA) is an FDA recommended therapy for clinical application in the management of severe recalcitrant psoriasis. Psoralen acts by intercalation of DNA and upon exposure to UV-A, it forms monoadducts which in turn induce apoptosis. Poor skin deposition, weak percutaneous permeability of psoralen and adverse effects of severe burning, blisters, pigmentation associated with conventional topical psoralen vehicles hinders the therapeutic efficacy and safety of topical PUVA. The aim of the present study is to formulate psoralen loaded liposomal nanocarriers for enhanced skin penetration, safety and efficacy of topical PUVA in psoriasis. Two different liposomal compositions i.e., cationic liposomes composed of DC-Chol, cholesterol and anionic liposomes composed of egg lecithin, cholesterol, tetramyristoyl cardiolipin were prepared for the topical delivery of psoralen. Liposomal carriers were characterized with respect to size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, stability, in vitro drug release and in vivo studies. Both liposomes were prepared with particle size of nearly 100nm. Zeta potential and entrapment efficiency of cationic liposomes were +25.8mV, 75.12% and anionic liposomes were -28.5mV, 60.08% respectively. Liposomal dermal distribution demonstrated higher penetration of both liposomal carriers over solution. Similarly, skin permeation study indicated 5 fold increase in permeation of psoralen with liposomal carriers. Topical application of psoralen liposomal gels on imiquimod induced psoriatic plaque model reduced the symptoms of psoriasis and levels of key psoriatic cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-17 and IL-22. In conclusion, the developed liposomal carriers of psoralen were found to be promising and can find application for optimal safety and efficacy of topical PUVA in psoriasis. "
"INTRODUCTION: Lipoid pneumonia is a clinical condition that may be initially asymptomatic or confused with an infectious or malignant lung disease. OBJECTIVES: We report four cases of this pathological condition. METHODS: The first case concerned an 85-year old woman with bilateral confluent pulmonary opacities, ground-glass type. Diagnosis was based on the cytology of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid followed by its ultrastructural examination. The second case was a 47-year-old man with an isolated pulmonary nodule, which was surgically removed; the diagnosis of lipoid pneumonia was formulated on the basis of the histological and electron microscopy examination. The third case concerned a 73-year-old woman, with bilateral hypodense areas at the bases of the lungs where FDG PET/CT scan showed an increased uptake. Diagnosis was formulated by BAL cytology and electron microscopy examination. The fourth case was a 69-year-old man, who performed a virtual colonoscopy for diverticulosis putting in evidence a round mass (3 cm in diameter) with two small peripheral nodules, located in the pulmonary left lower lobe. The histopathological examination of transthoracic biopsy confirmed a lipoid pneumonia. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: In all four cases, it was put in evidence a prolonged use of a nasal decongestant containing mineral oils. In literature, the most cases described are characterized by a subclinical evolution and were presented as ground glass opacities which evolve, in the later phases, in an interstitial involvement or in a peripheral mass, simulating a lung tumour.

"BACKGROUND: Sunscreens are known to protect from sun damage; however, their effects on the reversal of photodamage have been minimally investigated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the prospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of a facial sun protection factor (SPF) 30 formulation for the improvement of photodamage during a 1-year use. METHODS: Thirty-two subjects applied a broad spectrum photostable sunscreen (SPF 30) for 52 weeks to the entire face. Assessments were conducted through dermatologist evaluations and subjects' self-assessment at baseline and then at Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 52. RESULTS: Clinical evaluations showed that all photoaging parameters improved significantly from baseline as early as Week 12 and the amelioration continued until Week 52. Skin texture, clarity, and mottled and discrete pigmentation were the most improved parameters by the end of the study (40% to 52% improvement from baseline), with 100% of subjects showing improvement in skin clarity and texture. CONCLUSION: The daily use of a facial broad-spectrum photostable sunscreen may visibly reverse the signs of existing photodamage, in addition to preventing additional sun damage. "
"BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) as promising alternative to conventional cancer treatments works by irradiation of a photosensitizer (PS) with light, which creates reactive oxygen species and singlet oxygen ( RESULTS: In CAL-33 tumor bearing nude mice we compared the Lipidots to the existing liposomal mTHPC nanoformulation Foslip and the approved mTHPC formulation Foscan. We established biodistribution profiles via fluorescence measurements in vivo and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. All formulations accumulated in the tumors and we could determine the optimum treatment time point for each substance (8 h for mTHPC, 24 h for Foslip and 72 h for the Lipidots). We used two different light doses (10  and 20 J/cm CONCLUSIONS: We could demonstrate in our study that nanoformulations are superior to the free PS mTHPC. The development of a potent nanoformulation is of major importance because the free PS is related to several issues such as poor bioavailability, solubility and increased photosensibility of patients. We could show in this study that Foslip is very potent in destroying the tumors itself. However, because the Lipidots' biocompatibility is outstanding and superior to the liposomes we plan to carry out further investigations and protocol optimization. Both nanoformulations show great potential to revolutionize PDT in the future. "

"Abstract: Analgesic medications compounded for topical use are gaining popularity for the management of chronic pain. The advantages of topical pain medications include reduction of systemic adverse effects, improved patient acceptance, few drug interactions, ease of dose determination, avoidance of first-pass metabolism, and direct access to the target site. Compounded topical medications typically use a mixture of 3 or more single medications to achieve multiple complementary effects at lower doses of each individual medication. Herein, we review the mechanisms, adverse effects, and evidence for some of the most commonly used medications in topical compounds for pain management. Because more topical medications are used for chronic pain, dermatologists can expect an increase in irritant and allergic contact dermatitis related to these medications. "
"Abstract: Besides the unquestionable positive effects of solar exposure for human health, UV rays have been widely investigated for toxicology aspects related to excessive UVB and UVA doses, which involve sunburns, skin aging, DNA skin damage and tumorigenesis. At present, synthetic and mineral sunscreens are used to protect against these damages but several natural molecules can provide UV protection, including also synergic effect or enhanced photo stability. Although a large number of herbal extracts and plant origin molecules can deserve potential applications, most of the study reported utilizes different method and different strategies of investigation, making thus difficult to understand the real versus claimed potential. This is possibly one of the reasons why, beside the large body of literature there are no officially approved natural commercial sun-filter but a consistent number of commercially available solar products (sunscreen) on the market that contain herbal derivatives. In this review we have evaluated the papers appeared in the last 15years and we have critically collected the most significant data. Several databases, namely Scifinder, Pubmed, Google Scholar, ISI-Web of Science and Scopus, were used as literature sources; excluding patents and symposium or congress papers. Only articles in the English language have been selected. New formulation, new skin delivery systems, skin penetration enhancers and boosters are most likely the next frontier of investigation in order to better understand the role of whole herbal extracts in exerting their photo protective activity. "
"Abstract: Evidence shows that sunscreens undergo degradation processes induced by UV irradiation forming free radicals, which reduces skin protection. In this regard, the biological effects of three commercial sunscreen formulations upon UVB irradiation in the skin were investigated. The three formulations had in common the presence of benzophenone-3 added with octyl methoxycinnamate or octyl salycilate or both, which are regular UV filters in sunscreens. The results show that formulations F1 and F2 presented partial degradation upon UVB irradiation. Formulations F1 and F2 presented higher skin penetration profiles than F3. None of the formulations avoided UVB irradiation-induced GSH depletion, but inhibited reduction of SOD activity, suggesting the tested formulations did not present as a major mechanism inhibiting all UVB irradiation-triggered oxidative stress pathways. The formulations avoided the increase of myeloperoxidase activity and cytokine production (IL-1β and TNF-α), but with different levels of protection in relation to the IL-1β release. Concluding, UVB irradiation can reduce the stability of sunscreens, which in turn, present the undesirable properties of reaching viable skin. Additionally, the same SPF does not mean that different sunscreens will present the same biological effects as SPF is solely based on a skin erythema response. This found opens up perspectives to consider additional studies to reach highly safe sunscreens. "
"AIM: The delivered nanoparticle dose to cells in vitro may depend on nanoparticle sedimentation rate. Here, the conditions under which optical absorption spectroscopy can be used to quantify the deposited nanoparticle dose in vitro are investigated. MATERIALS & METHODS: Nanoparticle cytotoxicity in both upright and inverted cell culture orientations is studied in the presence and absence of serum. RESULTS: Dissolvable nanoparticles, such as ZnO, exhibit no difference in upright and inverted cultures due to dissolved Zn(2+) ions that dominate cytotoxicity. Insoluble nanoparticles, however, exhibit different sedimentation rates and deposited doses that are linked to the observed cytotoxicity. CONCLUSION: The combined use of upright-inverted cell orientations and optical absorption spectroscopy can provide a simple experimental approach to interpret in vitro nano-biointeractions. "
"Abstract: The chin and jaw line are integral parts of an individual's aesthetic profile, and the presence of submental fat detracts from this and can lead to displeasure with one's facial appearance. While liposuction and cosmetic surgery are regarded as the gold standard in treating submental fat, surgical intervention is not appealing to all patients and has potential surgical complications including longer recovery, and contour irregularities. Despite ample advances in aesthetic medicine to enhance the appearance of the face, very little is available in non-invasive options to reduce submental fat that has been supported by robust evidence. ATX-101, a proprietary formulation of deoxycholic acid that is synthetically derived, has been extensively explored in a vigorous clinical development program that has established the safety and efficacy of the injectable. It has recently received approval by regulatory authorities in Canada (Belkyra™) and the US (Kybella®) for the treatment of submental fat. "
"BACKGROUND: Concerns exist over the extrapolation of bioavailability studies of generic immunosuppressive drugs in healthy volunteers, regarding their efficacy and safety in kidney transplant recipients. We conducted a meta-analysis of trials examining the bioavailability of generic (test) immunosuppressive drugs relative to their brand (reference) counterparts in healthy volunteers, based on the US Food and Drug Administration requirements for approval of generics, and their efficacy and safety in kidney transplant recipients. METHODS: Eligible studies were identified in PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, and conference abstracts. RESULTS: Twenty crossover trials of healthy volunteers (n = 641) and 6 parallel-arm randomized controlled trials of kidney transplant recipients (n = 594) were identified. The 90% CI of the pooled test-to-reference drug ratio for maximum or peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration time-curve from time 0 to time of last determinable concentration (AUC(0-t)) fell within the required range (0.80-1.25) for cyclosporine (Cmax 0.91; 90% CI 0.86-0.95; and AUC(0-t) 0.97; 90% CI 0.94-1.00), tacrolimus (Cmax 1.17; 90% CI 1.09-1.24; and AUC(0-t) 1.00; 90% CI 0.97-1.03) and mycophenolate mofetil (Cmax 0.98; 90% CI 0.96-1.01; and AUC(0-t) 1.00; 90% CI 0.99-1.01). In subgroup analyses, some generic cyclosporine formulations did not meet criteria for bioequivalence. No significant differences were observed in the time to maximum plasma concentration and terminal plasma half-life between generic and brand drugs. In parallel-arm trials, generic cyclosporine was non-inferior to brand counterpart in terms of acute allograft rejection, infections, and death. CONCLUSIONS: Not all generic immunosuppressive drugs have similar relative bioavailability to their brand name counterparts. Evidence on their efficacy and safety is inconclusive. Tighter regulatory requirement for approval of generic drugs with narrow therapeutic index is needed. "
"BACKGROUND: Post inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) is a common problem occurs following many dermatologic diseases and medical interventions. Different modalities including topical agents, lasers and intense pulsed light (IPL) are suggested for treatment of the post-burn PIH. In the current study, we evaluated the efficacy of IPL plus modified Kligman cream (MODIFIED KLIGMAN CREAM) versus MODIFIED KLIGMAN CREAM alone in the treatment of the post-burn PIH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a randomized, non-blinded clinical trial. A total of 53 patches of post-burn PIP in 14 patients were randomized to receive either two sessions of IPL plus modified Kligman formula or kligman formula for 2 months. The patients were recommended to apply MODIFIED KLIGMAN CREAM cream for 12 h at night. RESULTS: According to our results, the patients in the MODIFIED KLIGMAN CREAM + IPL group had higher satisfaction as compared with MODIFIED KLIGMAN CREAM alone (P = 0.000) (Mann-Whitney test). In addition, according to physician evaluation, the patients in the MODIFIED KLIGMAN CREAM + IPL group had higher satisfaction as compared with MODIFIED KLIGMAN CREAM alone (P = 0.000) (Mann-Whitney test). No side effects except a little irritation, erythema and exfoliation due to MODIFIED KLIGMAN CREAM cream were seen in the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study showed the better efficacy and faster response of the IPL plus modified Kligman formula versus modified Kligman formula in the treatment of the post-burn PIH. To better determine the efficacy of IPL in treatment of the post-burn PIP, more extensive studies as randomized, double-blinded clinical trial are recommended. "
"Abstract: Nonadherence to topical treatment of psoriasis is a common cause of treatment failure. This focus group study was conducted to obtain the patients' own experiences and explanations regarding medical adherence. The participants consisted of eight primary adherent patients with moderate psoriasis treated with corticosteroid or corticosteroid-calcipotriol combinations, purposefully sampled by age and sex at a dermatology outpatient clinic. Secondary medical adherence was supported by accessibility of the prescribing physician, the prescriber taking time to listen, having a more manageable disease, using a nonstaining product, and establishing routines around treatment at home. Secondary medical adherence was affected negatively by changes in daily routines, if the treatment influenced the patient's sexual life, having too little time in the consultation room, lack of confidence in the prescriber, diverging information from health care personnel, experiencing side effects, having fear of side effects, impractical formulations of topical products, and impatience regarding time before an effect of the treatment was observed. From this study, the recommendations for the prescribing doctor to improve medical adherence are, the doctor needs to take time to listen to the patient, prescribe a topical product that is easy to apply and less greasy, inform the patients about benefits from treatments, and explain the rationale behind the treatment plan.

"PURPOSE: To compare the pharmacokinetics of 13-cis retinoic acid (13-cisRA) between Indian and UK neuroblastoma patients receiving comparable treatment, alongside measures of toxicity and response. METHODS: 13-cisRA (160 mg/m(2)/day) was administered to 36 patients ≤16 years in two divided doses. Plasma 13-cisRA concentrations were determined on days 1 and 14 of cycles 1 and 4 of treatment. Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-6h) was estimated using non-compartment modelling. Patients were genotyped for UGT2B7, CYP3A5*3, CYP3A7*2 and *2, *3 and *4 variants of CYP2C8. RESULTS: Marked inter-patient variability in 13-cisRA pharmacokinetics was observed. There was a trend towards a higher AUC0-6h on day 1 versus day 14 for both treatment cycles studied. Children who swallowed 13-cisRA capsules (n = 18) achieved higher AUC0-6h values compared to those who could not (n = 16) (Mean AUC 21.53 vs. 9.35 µM h, P < 0.05). Patients who were event free at 1 year tended to have higher AUC0-6h on C1D1 compared to those patients who progressed, although this did not reach significance with the number of patients studied (P = 0.08). Similarly, patients who achieved a 13-cisRA C max of ≥2 µM on C1D1 tended to have higher median EFS compared to those who did not (17.0 vs. 8.1 months). UGT2B7, CYP2C8*2/*3/*4 or CYP3A5*3 genotype did not have any effect on 13-cisRA pharmacokinetics. CONCLUSIONS: Method of administration markedly affects 13-cisRA pharmacokinetics in Indian neuroblastoma patients, supporting similar findings in UK patients. An appropriate oral liquid formulation of 13-cisRA that can be administered to all children with neuroblastoma is urgently needed on an international level. "
"Abstract: Methotrexate exhibits poor cutaneous bioavailability when administered topically using conventional vehicles. It is recommended for the treatment of skin-related diseases but its systemic side effects hamper application. The aim of this work was to formulate methotrexate in nanostructured lipid carriers using biocompatible lipids, and to investigate their potential for topical drug delivery. Methotrexate-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers were prepared via a hot ultrasonication method. Nanocarriers were evaluated for size, polydispersity, surface potential and entrapment efficiency. Shape and surface morphology of the produced lipid carriers confirmed their spherical shape. After 10h ca. 50% of methotrexate was released in vitro from the lipid nanocarriers following Peppas-Korsmeyer release kinetics. Moreover, methotrexate-loaded nanocarriers were stable at least for 3 months and less toxic towards fibroblasts and human keratinocytes than the free drug. Methotrexate within lipid nanocarriers was able to pass the experimental keratinocyte epidermal barrier at a flux rate of 2μgcm(-2)h(-1). Results demonstrated that lipid nanocarriers constitute a suitable approach for application of methotrexate in skin-related diseases topical therapy. "
"BACKGROUND: Fumaric acid esters (FAEs) are recommended in international guidelines for induction and long-term treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. The fixed combination Fumaderm OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of a new formulation of DMF (LAS41008), compared with placebo and Fumaderm METHODS: In this phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled, noninferiority trial (BRIDGE, NCT01726933, EudraCT 2012-000055-13), patients were randomized to receive LAS41008, Fumaderm RESULTS: In total, 671 patients were randomized and included in the full analysis set (n = 267, LAS41008; n = 273, Fumaderm CONCLUSIONS: LAS41008 (DMF) is effective in the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.

"Abstract: Candidal intertrigo is an infection of the skin caused by Candida albicans that typically occurs in opposing cutaneous or muco-cutaneous surfaces. Because Candidiasis requires a damaged and moist environment for infection, it typically occurs in areas of friction such as the skin folds of the body. Candidal intertrigo is often difficult to treat and results are often unsatisfactory. In addition, there is a lack of evidence-based literature supporting prevention and treatments for candidal intertrigo. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of Dr Michaels® (also branded as Fungatinex®) products in the treatment of fungal intertrigo, in 20 women and 2 men with a mean age of 72. Five patients (3 female and 2 male) had type 2 diabetes and 16 (14 female and 2 male) were obese. The patients were treated with Dr Michaels® (Fungatinex®) moisturising bar, topical ointment (twice daily application) and oral herbal formulation, PSC 200 two tablets twice daily with food. After 2 weeks of treatment, the lesions had mostly resolved in all patients with only slight erythema evident. After six weeks of treatment using the moisturising bar, topical ointment and oral herbal formulations from the Dr Michaels® (Fungatinex®) product family, the lesions had totally resolved in 18 patients, while 4 patients had to continue the therapeutic protocol for another 2 weeks. Our results demonstrate that the Dr Michaels® (Fungatinex®) complementary product family is efficacious in the treatment of recalcitrant candidal intertrigo. Furthermore, this study highlights that the Dr Michaels® (Fungatinex®) product family is fast-acting and well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. These data have important implications for resistant cases of candidal intertrigo where traditional therapies have failed. "
"UNLABELLED: Alopecia areata is a highly prevalent organ restricted autoimmune disorder that leads to disfiguring hair loss and is thought to involve a T cellmediated response to the hair follicle. The treatment of alopecia areata is often problematic and very frustrating, partly due to the unknown aetiology of the condition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of complementary medicine, Dr. Michaels® product family, in the treatment of alopecia areata. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 40 patients (27 female/13 male), with a mean age of 20.3 years, all of them with 1-3 lesions of stable alopecia areata localized on the scalp were included in this trial. Four patients suffered from Hashimoto thyroiditis, and one had a familial history of LES. Exclusion criteria were the use of any treatment or medication, which may influence or interfere with the course of the disease. All patients were treated with Dr. Michaels® StimOils - applied twice daily (morning and night), Hair Lotion  applied twice daily (morning and night), and oral herbal formulation - PSC 900 2ml twice daily with food for 16 weeks. For each patient, photographs of typical lesions were taken at the beginning and at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks follow-up. Patient improvement was determined by the percentage of hair regrowth for each lesion. RESULTS: After 10 weeks of treatment using StimOils, Hair Lotion and PSC 900 from Dr. Michaels® product family, 18 patients had achieved an excellent response with regrowth in all the affected alopecia areata patches. 17 patients achieved the same results after 12 weeks of treatment; the other 5 patients had to continue the therapeutic protocol for another 2-3 weeks. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the Dr. Michaels® StimOils, Hair Lotion and PSC 900 are an effective therapeutic option for the treatment of alopecia areata. This has important implications for resistant cases of alopecia areata where traditional systemic and topical corticosteroid therapies have failed. In addition, this treatment approach may be an attractive option for patients who have growing concern regarding side-effects of long-term corticosteroid therapy. "
"Abstract: Atopic eczema is a chronic relapsing inflammatory skin disorder, characterized clinically by intensely pruritic eczematous skin lesions and a defective epidermal barrier. It affects more than 15% of children and up to 10%of adults, which makes the disease a social health problem still without a challenging treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Dr Michaels® (Eczitinex®) topical product family in the treatment of atopic dermatitis in children. We studied a group of 30 patients (17 female, 13 male), aged 5 to 13 (mean age: 9), affected by atopic dermatitis since they were newborn. All patients had been unsuccessfully treated with conventional anti-inflammatory therapies and ceased treatment 2 weeks before commencing research. The patients were treated with Dr Michaels® (Eczitinex® and Itchinex®) product family including a moisturising bar, topical ointment and PSC 900 oral herbal formulation. The treatment was evaluated clinically and photographically at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 weeks. Twenty-eight patients showed a significant improvement of cutaneous rashes and pruritus on the first week of treatment, with a complete remission at 10-12 weeks. Only two patients, brother and sister respectively, showed a slow response to treatment and reported an increasing itching. Following 14 weeks of treatment with the Dr Michaels® (Eczitinex® and Itchinex®) product family, patients demonstrated complete resolution of their AD. All patients showed a marked improvement in their condition within 3 days of treatment with most of the lesions and symptoms totally resolved within 10 to 12 weeks of treatment with Dr Michaels® (Eczitinex® and Itchinex®) family of products. This clinical report highlights that the Dr Michaels® (Eczitinex® and Itchinex®) product family is a safe and effective treatment option for AD. "
"Abstract: Eye diseases, such as dry eye syndrome, are commonly treated with eye drop formulations. However, eye drop formulations require frequent dosing with high drug concentrations due to poor ocular surface retention, which leads to poor patient compliance and high risks of side effects. We developed a mucoadhesive nanoparticle eye drop delivery platform to prolong the ocular retention of topical drugs, thus enabling treatment of eye diseases using reduced dosage. Using fluorescent imaging on rabbit eyes, we showed ocular retention of the fluorescent dye delivered through these nanoparticles beyond 24 h while free dyes were mostly cleared from the ocular surface within 3 h after administration. Utilizing the prolonged retention of the nanoparticles, we demonstrated effective treatment of experimentally induced dry eye in mice by delivering cyclosporin A (CsA) bound to this delivery system. The once a week dosing of 0.005 to 0.01% CsA in NP eye drop formulation demonstrated both the elimination of the inflammation signs and the recovery of ocular surface goblet cells after a month. Thrice daily administration of RESTASIS on mice only showed elimination without recovering the ocular surface goblet cells. The mucoadhesive nanoparticle eye drop platform demonstrated prolonged ocular surface retention and effective treatment of dry eye conditions with up to 50- to 100-fold reduction in overall dosage of CsA compared to RESTASIS, which may significantly reduce side effects and, by extending the interdosing interval, improve patient compliance.

"Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune and inflammatory pathology, is resulted due to the disruption of immune-homeostasis and failure of host immune-surveillance mechanism leading to cartilage degradation and bone erosion. Orally and parenterally administered methotrexate (MTX) have had adverse systemic complications in RA therapeutics. Therefore, transdermal application of MTX is recommended for the treatment of RA [1]. Present study is designed to develop MTX loaded nanostructured lipid carriers and chemical enhancer co-incorporated hydrogel (gel-(MTX-NLCs+CE)) for an efficient transdermal delivery of MTX in a Freund's adjuvants induced experimental animal model of RA. A gel-(MTX-NLCs+CE) was formulated and evaluated for its biocompatibility in hyper keratinocytes (HaCaT) and human monocytic cells (U937). Further, systemic and local inflammation was assessed by the estimation of pro-inflammatory cytokines & joint-destructive enzymes (TNF-α, IL-6, MMP-1 & IL-1β,; iNOS & COX-2) in the serum and synovial fluid, respectively in an experimentally induced RA animal model. Prepared formulations were also evaluated with respect to arthritis index, arthritis score and histopathology of paw and ankle bones. The biocompatibility study of formulation on U937 and HaCaT is suggestive of safe and greater therapeutic efficacy of the developed formulations. Our results show that transcutaneous ability of MTX loaded nanostructured lipid carries (NLCs) and chemical enhancer (CE) co-incorporated hydrogel significantly (p<0.001) decreases the inflammation in RA animal model. In conclusion, developed NLCs-based gel formulation loaded with MTX opens new avenues for developing novel therapeutic modality for RA patients with the acceptably minimum adverse effects. "
"Abstract: Prevention of the penetration of toxic agents through the skin is crucial for both military troops and civilian populations. We have developed a novel topical skin protectant (TSP), coded as IB1 and commercially available as Dermostyx protective solution (Rekah Pharm, Israel). The formulation afforded significant protection against chemical warfare agents such as sulfur mustard (SM) and VX (2LD50), pesticides such as parathion and irritants such as acrolein. The efficacy of the protectant was evaluated in the pig model using clinical, histological and biochemical monitoring. A single topical application prior to exposure to the toxic agents reduced significantly the size and severity of skin lesions and ameliorated or prevented systemic clinical symptoms. The barrier properties of IB1 are immediate upon application and remain effective for at least 12 h. It is absorbed into the stratum corneum of the skin and remains there until rinsing with water, yet the ingredients are not absorbed into the body. The formulation is a hydrophilic water-based solution, composed of magnesium sulfate and glycerin that are widely used in cosmetic and medicine, and was shown to be safe in preclinical and in Phase I clinical studies. The suggested mode of action is based on the unique interaction of glycerin with the stratum corneum, changing its properties to hydrophilic and on the ""salting out"" effect of magnesium sulfate. The expected use of the TSP is by application on exposed skin areas and sensitive skin sites (e.g. armpits, groin, waist), when necessary. A quantity of 10 ml is sufficient for one application covering approximately 20% of the body surface area. The formulation was approved for human use by the Israel Ministry of Health and a CE mark certificate in Europe has been recently issued (Class I). Dermostyx has been adopted by the IDF and first responders as a skin protectant for special needs. "
"Abstract: Anisamide-functionalized reversibly crosslinked chimeric polymersomes emerge as an ""all-function-in-one"" nanoplatform for efficient loading and targeted delivery of methotrexate disodium, a potent water-soluble anticancer drug, to sigma receptor overexpressing H460 nonsmall lung cancer xenografts in vivo, leading to markedly improved tumor-growth inhibition and survival rate and depleted adverse effects as compared to the clinically used formulation (Trexall).

"Abstract: The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel assessed the safety of 131 alkyl polyethylene glycol (PEG)/polypropylene glycol ethers as used in cosmetics, concluding that these ingredients are safe in the present practices of use and concentration described in this safety assessment when formulated to be nonirritating. Most of the alkyl PEG/PPG ethers included in this review are reported to function in cosmetics as surfactants, skin-conditioning agents, and/or emulsifying agents. The alkyl PEG/PPG ethers share very similar physiochemical properties as the alkyl PEG ethers, which were reviewed previously by the CIR Expert Panel and found safe when formulated to be nonirritating. The alkyl PEG ethers differ by the inclusion of PPG repeat units, which are used to fine-tune the surfactant properties of this group. The Panel relied heavily on data on analogous ingredients, extracted from the alkyl PEG ethers and PPG reports, when making its determination of safety. "
"Abstract: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting mainly the skin but which can be complicated by psoriatic arthritis (PsA).This autoimmune skin disorder concerns 2-5% of the world population. To date, the physiopathology of psoriasis is not still completely elucidated but many researches are ongoing which have led for example to the discovery of the Th17/Th22 pathway. The conventional therapeutic approaches (local or systemic route) appeal to various classes of drugs with complex mechanisms of action and non-negligible side effects. Although there is no therapy capable to cure psoriasis, the current goal is to relieve symptoms as longer as possible with a good benefit/risk ratio. That is one of the principal limits of conventional antipsoriatic drugs. New formulations based on nanoencapsulation are a promising opportunity to answer to this limit by offering an optimization of the conventional antipsoriatic drug use (higher activity, lower side effects and frequency of application, etc.). Herein, we tried to put in perspective the mechanistic insights (histological and immunological views) proposed into scientific literature these last years in order to have a better comprehension of psoriasis physiopathology resulting in skin lesions and PsA. The therapeutic armamentarium and the different strategies in the management of psoriasis are discussed in greater details. To finish, the field of encapsulation in nanoparticles is broached in order to put forward recent advances in innovative skin drug delivery systems (ISDDSs) of antipsoriatic active agents for a better efficacy, safety and compliance.

"Abstract: Practitioners are increasingly using topical anesthetics in the field of dermatology. Application of topical anesthetics prior to performing dermatologic procedures has proven to decrease pain and discomfort associated with these procedures. Despite the prevalent use of topical anesthetics, there are few standard guidelines for about which products provide optimal and safest use. Adverse events are often correlated with improper application of topical anesthetics. A few case reports have cited adverse events related to the use of compounded products that the United States Food and Drug Administration has not approved, such as benzocaine, lidocaine, tetracaine. In this article, the authors report the possible ocular side effects due to the use of benzocaine, lidocaine, tetracaine. Careful attention must be paid to this compounded product, and better formulations are needed in order to prevent adverse events. "
"Abstract: An important part of assessing the toxic potential of nanoparticles for specific applications should be the direct comparison of biological activities with those of alternative materials for the same application. Nanoparticulate inorganic ultraviolet (UV) filters, such as zinc oxide (ZnO), are commonly incorporated into transparent sunscreen and cosmetic formulations. However, concerns have been raised about potential unwanted effects, despite their negligible skin penetration and inherent advantages over organic chemical UV-filters. To provide useful application-relevant assessments of their potential hazard with/without UVA co-exposure, we directly compared cytotoxic and immune response profiles of human THP-1 monocytic cells to ZnO nanoparticles (30 nm) with bulk ZnO particulates (200 nm) and five conventional organic chemical UV-filters - butylmethoxydibenzoylmethane (avobenzone), octylmethoxycinnamate, octylsalicylate, homosalate and 4-methylbenzylidene camphor. High exposure concentrations of both organic and particulate UV-filters were required to cause cytotoxicity in monocyte and macrophage cultures after 24 h. Co-exposure with UVA (6.7 J/cm(2)) did not alter cytotoxicity profiles. Particle surface area-based dose responses showed that ZnO NPs were better tolerated than bulk ZnO. Organic and particulate UV-filters increased apoptosis at similar doses. Only particulates increased the generation of reactive oxygen species. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) release was increased by all particulates, avobenzone, homosalate and octylsalicylate. IL-1β release was only increased in macrophages by exposure to avobenzone and homosalate. In conclusion, direct effects were caused in monocytes and macrophages at similar concentrations of both organic UV-filters and ZnO nanoparticulates - indicating that their intrinsic cytotoxicity is similar. With their lower skin penetration, ZnO nanoparticles are expected to have lower bioactivity when used in sunscreens. "
"Abstract: DNA damage can be assessed by the quantitation of γH2AX foci that form at DSB sites. This study examines the generation and persistence of γH2AX foci, variability in foci size after acute and fractionated radiation exposure, and the effect of pretreatment with a safe radioprotective formulation termed G-003M on foci generation and persistence. G-003M contains a combination of podophyllotoxin and rutin hydrate, and was administered intramuscularly to rabbits 1 hr prior to Co(60) gamma irradiation. Rabbits were assigned to one of the following treatment groups: untreated, G-003M alone, irradiated (single dose 8 Gy, fractionated 2 Gy/day for 4 days or single dose 2 Gy) or G-003M preadministration followed by radiation exposure. Foci continuously persisted for a week in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of rabbits exposed to a single 8 Gy dose. However, the number of foci gradually decreased after reaching a maximum at 1 h. In rabbits exposed to fractionated radiation, foci detected 1 hr after the final exposure were significantly larger (P < 0.001) than in rabbits exposed to a single 8 Gy dose, but disappeared completely after 24 h. In both groups, foci reappeared on days 11-15 in terminally ill animals. G-003M pretreatment significantly (P < 0.05) attenuated the formation of γH2AX foci in all irradiated rabbits. This study reveals that γH2AX focus assessment could be used to confirm radiation exposure, that focus size reflects the type of radiation exposure (acute or fractionated), that the re-appearance of foci is a strong indicator of imminent death in animals, and that G-003M provides protection against radiation.

"BACKGROUND: The efficacy of infliximab and ciclosporin in treating severe ulcerative colitis (UC) is proven, but there has been no comparative evaluation of effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of infliximab and ciclosporin in treating steroid-resistant acute severe UC. METHOD: Between May 2010 and February 2013 we recruited 270 participants from 52 hospitals in England, Scotland and Wales to an open-label parallel-group, pragmatic randomised trial. Consented patients admitted with severe colitis completed baseline quality-of-life questionnaires before receiving intravenous hydrocortisone. If they failed to respond within about 5 days, and met other inclusion criteria, we invited them to participate and used a web-based adaptive randomisation algorithm to allocate them in equal proportions between 5 mg/kg of intravenous infliximab at 0, 2 and 6 weeks or 2 mg/kg/day of intravenous ciclosporin for 7 days followed by 5.5 mg/kg/day of oral ciclosporin until 12 weeks from randomisation. Further treatment was at the discretion of physicians responsible for clinical management. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted survival (QAS): the area under the curve (AUC) of scores derived from Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis Questionnaires completed by participants at 3 and 6 months, and then 6-monthly over 1-3 years, more frequently after surgery. Secondary outcomes collected simultaneously included European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) scores and NHS resource use to estimate cost-effectiveness. Blinding was possible only for data analysts. We interviewed 20 trial participants and 23 participating professionals. Funded data collection finished in March 2014. Most participants consented to complete annual questionnaires and for us to analyse their routinely collected health data over 10 years. RESULTS: The 135 participants in each group were well matched at baseline. In 121 participants analysed in each group, we found no significant difference between infliximab and ciclosporin in QAS [mean difference in AUC/day 0.0297 favouring ciclosporin, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.0088 to 0.0682; p = 0.129]; EQ-5D scores (quality-adjusted life-year mean difference 0.021 favouring ciclosporin, 95% CI -0.032 to 0.096; p = 0.350); Short Form questionnaire-6 Dimensions scores (mean difference 0.0051 favouring ciclosporin, 95% CI -0.0250 to 0.0353; p = 0.737). There was no statistically significant difference in colectomy rates [odds ratio (OR) 1.350 favouring infliximab, 95% CI 0.832 to 2.188; p = 0.223]; numbers of serious adverse reactions (event ratio = 0.938 favouring ciclosporin, 95% CI 0.590 to 1.493; p = 0.788); participants with serious adverse reactions (OR 0.660 favouring ciclosporin, 95% CI 0.282 to 1.546; p = 0.338); numbers of serious adverse events (event ratio 1.075 favouring infliximab, 95% CI 0.603 to 1.917; p = 0.807); participants with serious adverse events (OR 0.999 favouring infliximab, 95% CI 0.473 to 2.114; p = 0.998); deaths (all three who died received infliximab; p = 0.247) or concomitant use of immunosuppressants. The lower cost of ciclosporin led to lower total NHS costs (mean difference -£5632, 95% CI -£8305 to -£2773; p < 0.001). Interviews highlighted the debilitating effect of UC; participants were more positive about infliximab than ciclosporin. Professionals reported advantages and disadvantages with both drugs, but nurses disliked the intravenous ciclosporin. CONCLUSIONS: Total cost to the NHS was considerably higher for infliximab than ciclosporin. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference between the two drugs in clinical effectiveness, colectomy rates, incidence of SAEs or reactions, or mortality, when measured 1-3 years post treatment. To assess long-term outcome participants will be followed up for 10 years post randomisation, using questionnaires and routinely collected data. Further studies will be needed to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of new anti-tumour necrosis factor drugs and formulations of ciclosporin.

"Abstract: Prostaglandins and their analogues are beneficial as topical agents in vitiligo treatment, yet neither of the previous study addressed their comparative efficiency with conventional topical agents used in vitiligo treatment. In this pilot (24 patients) left-right comparative study we addressed efficiency of prostaglandin F2α analogue latanoprost versus tacrolimus when combined with narrow-band ultraviolet B and microneedling in repigmentation of nonsegmental vitiligo lesions. Our results confirm potency of prostaglandins, in particular, that of latanoprost, in inducing repigmentation, with the efficiency being at least comparable to that of tacrolimus, while contribution of microneedling remains unclear. In summary, results of our study provide further evidences for justified use of prostaglandins, in particular, latanoprost, in vitiligo treatment. In turn, this warrants future studies on the topic aiming to conclusively introduce prostaglandin-based formulations as conventional agents for vitiligo management. "
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: With advancement in our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), there is tremendous enthusiasm in examining drugs, old and new, to improve outcomes. This review highlights recent trials' successes and impasses that have come to fore. RECENT FINDINGS: Among B-cell therapies, belimumab continues its run of successes with sustained safety and tolerability documented in a long-term extension as well as the likely approval of a subcutaneous formulation in the near future. With greater antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and less immunogenicity, there is hope for obinituzumab to succeed where its anti-CD 20 predecessors have failed. Drugs targeting type I interferons - sifalimumab and anifrolumab - have been efficacious albeit with an increase in incidence of Herpes zoster infections. There is also renewed interest in evaluating the efficacy of calcineurin inhibitors, specifically tacrolimus in the induction and maintenance of lupus nephritis. Introspection into clinical trial designs have highlighted the effects of entry criteria, end points, background medications and geographical differences on study outcomes. SUMMARY: There are at least 50 drugs and targets being evaluated in SLE. In addition to developing new drugs to treat lupus, future trials have to focus on more effective study designs to improve chances of trial success. "
"BACKGROUND: Dietary modification, through supplementation and elimination diets, has become an area of interest to help slow skin aging, reduce symptom severity or prevent reoccurrence of certain dermatologic conditions [Clinical Dermatology vol. 31 (2013) 677-700]. Free radical components (reactive oxygen species or ROS) or lipid peroxide (LPO) is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of accelerated skin aging when prolonged oxidative stress occurs. The use of antioxidant-related therapies such as nutraceuticals is of particular interest in restoring skin homeostasis. Antioxidant carotenoid zeaxanthin is concentrated in the eye and skin tissue and believed to decrease the formation of ROS associated with UV light exposure. With zeaxanthin, phytoceramides, and botanical extracts an oral and topical test product (with zeaxanthin, algae extracts, peptides, hyaluronate) have been developed to improve the appearance and condition of skin when used as directed. METHODS: Subjects were divided into three groups: two tests (skin formula 1 - oral product alone (ZO-1), skin formula 2- oral product with topical product (ZO-2 + ZT)), and one placebo control. The study consisted of a washout visit, baseline (randomization), week two (2), week four (4), week six (6), week eight (8), and week twelve (12). Key parameters measured were as follows: fine lines, deep lines, total wrinkles, wrinkle severity, radiance/skin color (L, a*, b*), discolorations, and skin pigment homogeneity. RESULTS: Thirty-one subjects completed the twelve-week study; no adverse events were recorded during the study. Statistically significant improvements from baseline mean hydration score were observed in active groups at weeks 2, 6, and 8. A statistically significant difference was observed between mean differences from baseline scores for total wrinkle count at week 4 for the combination active groups compared to placebo. A statistically significant difference from baseline scores for fine lines count was also observed at the week 4 visit compared to placebo for both active groups. Statistically significant differences from baseline scores for average wrinkles severity were seen for week 12 visit for both active groups compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: We have shown that the combination of zeaxanthin-based dietary supplement plus a topical formulation produces superior hydration to that of placebo. Additionally, we have shown that the combination of oral and topical combination vs. oral alone has superior abilities to improve parameters associated with facial lines and wrinkles compared to placebo, although the dietary supplement alone proved most effective in reducing wrinkle count and severity.

"Abstract: In cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT), an efficient and homogeneous intratumoral accumulation of the photosensitizer (PS) is required to induce cell damages in the entire tumor mass after light activation. Thus, in this study we investigated penetration ability and photodynamic efficiency of meta-tetra(hydroxyphenyl)chlorin (m-THPC) in standard formulation (Foscan®) and in its non PEGylated and PEGylated liposomal formulations, Foslip® and Fospeg®, in HeLa multicellular spheroids, as in vitro avascular models of solid tumors. Confocal microscopy studies demonstrated that m-THPC fluorescence was confined in the external cell layers of spheroids with a slightly higher accumulation of Foslip® and Fospeg® with respect to Foscan®. Irradiation with red light, following 24h incubation of spheroids with the m-THPC formulations, caused however photodamages also in cells located in the central part of spheroids, as documented by transmission electron microscopy analyses. Overall, the photodynamic effects of the three m-THPC formulations on HeLa cell spheroids were comparable in terms of cell viability measured with the MTS assay. It is however worth noting that the delivery of m-THPC by liposomes significantly abolished its cytotoxicity in the dark, slightly improved the cellular uptake and, following PDT, promoted cell loss and spheroid disassembling to a higher extent when compared to Foscan®.

"AIM: Use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during the final trimester of pregnancy can cause fetal toxicity, such as ductus arteriosus (DA) constriction. The aim of this study was to predict quantitatively the fetal DA-constrictive effects of NSAIDs after various routes of administration to the mother by means of harmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling. METHODS: We evaluated acetaminophen, which is a first-line analgesic/antipyretic for the third trimester of pregnancy, together with the following NSAIDs: indometacin, diclofenac, ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, ketoprofen, loxoprofen, felbinac, naproxen, and celecoxib. Drug concentration data obtained in rats and humans were collected from the literature to calculate PK parameters. Next, the PD parameters for DA constriction in rats were obtained by fitting an Emax model to the DA/pulmonary artery (PA) inner diameter ratio after oral administration of each drug to full-term pregnant rats (data taken from the literature) and the unbound plasma concentration in rat dams estimated from the obtained PK parameters. Finally, the inner DA diameter profile after administration of each drug to human mothers was predicted. RESULTS: This PK/PD model predicted continuous fetal DA constriction in third-trimester women after repeated systemic use of nearly all the NSAIDs evaluated. Local dermatological formulations of NSAIDs were also predicted to potentially cause DA constriction. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that risk to the fetus should be carefully considered before administration of NSAIDs (especially systemic formulations, but including dermatological formulations) to women in the third trimester of pregnancy.

"UNLABELLED: A promising approach to neurotherapeutics involves activating the nuclear-factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element signaling, which regulates expression of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective genes. Tecfidera, a putative Nrf2 activator, is an oral formulation of dimethylfumarate (DMF) used to treat multiple sclerosis. We compared the effects of DMF and its bioactive metabolite monomethylfumarate (MMF) on Nrf2 signaling and their ability to block 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced experimental Parkinson's disease (PD). We show that in vitro DMF and MMF activate the Nrf2 pathway via S-alkylation of the Nrf2 inhibitor Keap1 and by causing nuclear exit of the Nrf2 repressor Bach1. Nrf2 activation by DMF but not MMF was associated with depletion of glutathione, decreased cell viability, and inhibition of mitochondrial oxygen consumption and glycolysis rates in a dose-dependent manner, whereas MMF increased these activities in vitro However, both DMF and MMF upregulated mitochondrial biogenesis in vitro in an Nrf2-dependent manner. Despite the in vitro differences, both DMF and MMF exerted similar neuroprotective effects and blocked MPTP neurotoxicity in wild-type but not in Nrf2 null mice. Our data suggest that DMF and MMF exhibit neuroprotective effects against MPTP neurotoxicity because of their distinct Nrf2-mediated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and mitochondrial functional/biogenetic effects, but MMF does so without depleting glutathione and inhibiting mitochondrial and glycolytic functions. Given that oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction are all implicated in PD pathogenesis, our results provide preclinical evidence for the development of MMF rather than DMF as a novel PD therapeutic. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Almost two centuries since its first description by James Parkinson, Parkinson's disease (PD) remains an incurable disease with limited symptomatic treatment. The current study provides preclinical evidence that a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug, dimethylfumarate (DMF), and its metabolite monomethylfumarate (MMF) can block nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine mouse model of PD. We elucidated mechanisms by which DMF and its active metabolite MMF activates the redox-sensitive transcription factor nuclear-factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) to upregulate antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, mitochondrial biosynthetic and cytoprotective genes to render neuroprotection via distinct S-alkylating properties and depletion of glutathione. Our data suggest that targeting Nrf2-mediated gene transcription using MMF rather than DMF is a promising approach to block oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction for therapeutic intervention in PD while minimizing side effects.

"BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) using topical application of aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is an effective treatment for acne vulgaris. However, there is no clear consensus on the treatment regime in Asians.<BR /> AIM: To determine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 5% ALA PDT in the treatment of truncal acne in Asians.<BR /> METHODS: Patients with truncal acne were treated with 5%-ALA under occlusion for 3 hours. All were subsequently treated with a red light source at wavelength 630 nm and an irradiance of 38mW/cm RESULTS: Fifteen patients were recruited. Overall, there was a 64.2% reduction in the inflammatory lesions count and a 24.3% reduction in the non-inflammatory lesions count at the end of the 12 weeks follow-up. Both mean lesions counts were significantly lower than baseline at all follow-up time points with paired t tests (all P values <0.05). Pain was well tolerated among our patients.<BR /> CONCLUSION: A single treatment session of 5%-ALA PDT was effective for the treatment of truncal acne with little side effects and acceptable in our Asian patients.<BR /><BR /> <em>J Drugs Dermatol</em>. 2016;15(6):727-732.

"Abstract: Topical therapy of acne vulgaris (acne) is very common, however cutaneous tolerability can influence patient adherence, and concerns about skin irritation have lead to a number of comparative split-face studies. Advances in formulation technology have provided new fixed combinations with lower concentrations of potentially irritating ingredients without compromising efficacy. These developments now afford the opportunity to formulate fixed combinations with higher concentrations of active ingredients that may provide the greater efficacy needed in more severe disease with good tolerability.<br /> Here, we compare the tolerability of two such developments, clindamycin-BP 3.75% gel and adapalene 0.3%-BP 2.5% gel, in healthy volunteers with no apparent facial redness or dryness over 21-days, using a split-face methodology.<br /> Clindamycin-BP 3.75% gel was more tolerable than adapalene 0.3%-BP 2.5% gel over the duration of the two studies, with statistically significant differences in cumulative change from baseline starting as early as day 4 (stinging), day 5 (erythema, dryness, and scaling), day 6 (burning), and day 8 (itching); and in composite irritation index (stinging, erythema, dryness, scaling, burning, and itching) from day 4. Transepidermal water loss was less with clindamycin-BP 3.75% gel (statistically significant from day 8). Adverse events were twice as common with adapalene 0.3%-BP 2.5% gel.<br /> These data suggest that clindamycin-BP 3.75% gel is likely to be better tolerated than adapalene 0.3%-BP 2.5% gel in moderate-to-severe acne. <br /><br /> <em>J Drugs Dermatol. </em>2016;15(6):721-726.

"Abstract: Actinic keratosis (AK), a common cutaneous lesion with the potential to transform into squamous cell carcinoma, has traditionally been treated with ablative and/or surgical procedures. Recently, a topical formulation combining 0.5% 5-fluorouracil with 10% salicylic acid (5-FU-SA) was introduced in Europe under the trade name Actikerall™ for the treatment of grade I/II AKs. In a single randomized phase III trial, 5-FU-SA was shown to be superior to diclofenac 3% gel in hyaluronic acid, as measured by the histological clearance of one defined lesion (72% vs. 59.1%) and by complete clinical clearance (55.4% vs. 32.0%). 5-FU-SA should be applied once daily to a total area of up to 25 cm(2), which may include the lesion(s) and a small area of surrounding skin (rim of healthy skin should not exceed 0.5 cm), for up to 12 weeks. The most common side effects are local inflammation and pruritus at the application site, and no serious adverse effects have been reported to date. Now commercially available in Canada, 5-FU-SA represents a patientapplied therapeutic option for the treatment of both overt and subclinical AKs. "
"BACKGROUND: Burn-induced hypertrophic scars are disfiguring and can be associated with severe and intractable pruritus. No effective treatment modalities are currently available for symptomatic control of pruritus for most patients. We assessed the effect of the Antipruritic Hydrogel (CQ-01) in the symptomatic treatment of severe and intractable pruritus associated with burn-induced hypertrophic scars in a prospective, multicenter, controlled trial. METHODS: A pilot study was conducted in healthy adult volunteers to identify the most appropriate hydrogel formulation. A selected preparation called Chongqing No. 1 (CQ-01; a guar gum-based hydrogel impregnated with peppermint oil, menthol, and methyl salicylate by a nanoemulsion), showed an excellent symptomatic relief in an exploratory study in 2 patients with intractable pruritus. A statistically powered, prospective, multicenter, controlled study was then conducted in 74 patients to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 24-h application of CQ-01 compared to a gel control and a negative control on three separate areas in each patient. Symptom assessment was based on our visual analog JW scale (ranging from 0 to 100) at baseline and various time points up to 7 days after application. Follow-up studies were conducted to determine the reproducibility of CQ-01 in repeated applications. RESULTS: Of the 74 enrolled subjects, the only observed adverse event was skin irritation reported in 6 patients (8%) and resolved shortly after gel removal. Compared to the baseline, the gauze negative control had a mean JW score reduction of 7; while the gel control and CQ-01 had a drop of 18 (p<0.001) and 36 (p<0.001), respectively. The CQ-01 clinical effect was significant for up to 3 days and waned slowly from 3 to 7 days. There was no statistical correlation between the treatment response and any of the demographic, patient or burn-related factors. Further studies showed a trend that repeated applications might be more effective, suggesting the absence of tachyphylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective, multicenter, controlled study showed that this novel hydrogel CQ-01 is safe and provides significant symptomatic relief for severe and intractable pruritus associated with hypertrophic scars, an unmet medical need for these patients. This effect is independent of the etiology of the burn trauma, extent of the scarring, and duration of the scar formation. "
"Abstract: Metarril SP Organic is a product based on the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae, which was developed for controlling agricultural pests. The present study evaluated the effect of Metarril SP Organic plus 10% mineral oil, for controlling Rhipicephalus microplus under field conditions. Three groups were formed: Control group, which received no treatment; Oil control group, which was bathed only with water, Tween 80 and mineral oil; and Metarril group, bathed in the oil-based formulation Metarril SP Organic. Two treatments per group were performed and to verify the effect of the treatments, all R. microplus ticks between 4.5 and 8.0mm in length on the left side of the cattle were counted on days +7, +14 and +21 after each treatment, and a sample of engorged females was collected for evaluation of biological parameters. The Metarril SP Organic oil formulation showed efficacy ranging from 8.53 to 90.53%. The average efficacy of the oil-based formulation of Metarril SP Organic was 75.09 and 46.59% compared with the groups Control and Oil control, respectively. There were no significant changes in biological parameters of engorged R. microplus females collected from animals. Although there was no significant difference in the amount of ticks between the Oil control and Metarril groups, it is believed that the association of mineral oil with Metarril SP Organic product is effective in R. microplus tick control in field. Thus, this association has potential to be used in strategic control programs of cattle tick. "
"Abstract: The prime objective of current investigation was to develop a topical skin care cream (w/o) loaded with Ananas comosus extract versus placebo control, and evaluated non-invasively for changes in skin barrier function i.e., epidermal hydration levels and transepidermal water loss (TEWL), on healthy human volunteers. Active cream carrying 2% extract of Ananas comosus in the internal phase of w/o emulsion was prepared while placebo contained no extract. Stability assessment of both creams was performed at various storage conditions 8, 25, 40 degrees C, 40 degrees C + 75% RH (relative humidity) and 50 degrees C. Effects on epidermal hydration and TEWL were observed by applying active cream at one side and placebo on the other side of face by 11 healthy human volunteers during 12 weeks period using Corneometer MPA5 and Tewameter MPA5. Results indicated that both creams (active and placebo) remained stable at all storage conditions. All samples manifested non-Newtonian, shear thinning behavior with increasing shear rate, whereas statistical interpretation indicated that effects of active cream were superior than placebo, as it significantly (p = 0.05) improves the epidermal hydration levels up to 56.74% and reduces TEWL up to -73.19% at the end of study period compared to baseline value. The surface evaluation of living skin (SELS) parameters SEr, SEsc, SEsm, SEw were also assessed and indicated a significant (p = 0.05) reduction. Conclusively, creams loaded with Ananas comosus extract exhibit better physicochemical stability and represent a propitious improvement in skin barrier function, used as a functional moisturizing and anti-aging ingredient in topical skincare products.

"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Topical application of tretinoin (TRE) is followed by a high incidence of side effects. One method to overcome the problem is loading TRE into lipid nanoparticles. The potential safety of the nanoparticle materials has been always considered as a major concern. In this in vivo study, changes in human skin biophysical parameters including hydration, TEWL, erythema, and pH have been used to determine the safety of tretinoin loaded nano emulsion (NE) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC). METHOD: TRE loaded NE and NLC were prepared using a high pressure homogenizer. Skin biophysical parameters were measured on the volar forearms of twenty healthy volunteers, before and after applying TRE-NE and TRE-NLC lotions. All the measurements were done using respective probes of MPA 580Cutometer®. RESULT: We obtained particles of nanometric size (<130 nm) with narrow distribution and optimal physical stability. None of the formulations made any statistically significant change in any of the measured skin properties. P-values were 0.646, 0.139, 0.386, 0.169 after applying TRE-NE and 0.508, 0.051, 0.139, 0.333 after applying TRE-NLC, respectively. CONCLUSION: Both formulations are reasonably safe to apply on human skin and topical application of TRE-NE and TRE-NLC had almost similar effects on skin biophysical parameters. "
"Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer is known for its limited number of side effects, and requires light, oxygen and photosensitizer. However, PDT is limited by poor penetration of light into deeply localized tissues, and the use of external light sources is required. Thus, researchers have been studying ways to improve the effectiveness of this phototherapy and expand it for the treatment of the deepest cancers, by using chemiluminescent or bioluminescent formulations to excite the photosensitizer by intracellular generation of light. The aim of this Minireview is to give a précis of the most important general chemi-/bioluminescence mechanisms and to analyze several studies that apply them for PDT. These studies have demonstrated the potential of utilizing chemi-/bioluminescence as excitation source in the PDT of cancer, besides combining new approaches to overcome the limitations of this mode of treatment.

"Abstract: Since toxicity and resistance are the major drawbacks of current antileishmanial drugs, studies have been recently focused on combination therapy in fight against leishmaniasis. Combination therapy generally provides opportunity to decrease toxicity of applied agents and enhance their antimicrobial performance. Moreover, this method can be effective in preventing drug resistance. Highly antileishmanial effects of silver doped titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiAgNps) and Nigella sativa oil were demonstrated in previous studies. However, toxicity is still an important factor preventing use of these molecules in clinic. By considering high antileishmanial potential of each agent and basic principles of combination therapy, we propose that use of combinations including non-toxic concentrations of TiAgNps and N. sativa oil may compose more effective and safer formulations against Leishmania parasites. Therefore, the main goal of the present study was to investigate antileishmanial effects of non-toxic concentrations of TiAgNps and Nigella sativa oil combinations on promastigote and amastigote-macrophage culture systems and also to develop nanotechnology based new antileishmanial strategies against Cutaneous Leishmaniasis. Numerous parameters such as proliferation, metabolic activity, apoptosis, amastigote-promastigote conversion, infection index analysis and nitric oxide production were used to detect antileishmanial efficacies of combinations. Investigated all parameters demonstrated that TiAgNps-N. sativa oil combinations had significant antileishmanial effect on each life forms of parasites. Tested combinations were found to decrease proliferation rates of Leishmania tropica promastigotes in a range between 1,5-25 folds and metabolic activity values between 2 and 4 folds indicating that combination applications lead to virtually inhibition of promastigotes and elimination of parasites were directly related to apoptosis manner. TiAgNps-N. sativa combinations also demonstrated killing effects on L. tropica amastigotes by decreasing infection index values of macrophages 5-20 folds, inhibiting their metabolic activities up to 5 fold, preventing amastigote-promastigote conversion and producing high amounts of nitric oxide. All these results emphasize high potential of TiAgNps-N. sativa oil combinations as new, safer and effective antileishmanial formulations against Cutaneous Leishmaniasis. "
"Abstract: Curcumin and emu oil derived from emu bird (Dromaius novaehollandiae) has shown promising results against inflammation. However, the delivery of curcumin is hindered due to low solubility and poor permeation. In addition, till date the role of emu oil in drug delivery has not been explored systemically. Hence, the current investigation was designed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory potential of curcumin in combination with emu oil from a nanoemulgel formulation in experimental inflammation and arthritic in vivo models. Nanoemulsion was prepared using emu oil, Cremophor RH 40 and Labrafil M2125CS as oil phase, surfactant and co-surfactant. The optimized curcumin loaded nanoemulsion with emu oil was incorporated into carbopol gel for convenient application by topical route. The anti-inflammatory efficacy was evaluated in carrageenan induced paw edema and FCA induced arthritic rat model in terms of paw swelling, weight indices of the liver and spleen, pathological changes in nuclear factor kappa B, iNOS, COX-2 expression and inflammatory cytokines. Arthritic scoring, paw volume, biochemical, molecular, radiological and histological examinations indicated significant improvement in anti-inflammatory activity with formulations containing curcumin in combination with emu oil compared to pure curcumin. These encouraging results demonstrate the potential of formulations containing curcumin and emu oil combination in rheumatoid arthritis. "
"INTRODUCTION: Topical drug delivery is a challenging area with many advantages such as avoidance of first passage effect, stabilization of blood concentrations and attainment of local therapeutic effect with fewer side effects. Despite all these advantages, topical drug delivery remains limited to few molecules, since skin acts as a barrier to the delivery of many therapeutic molecules. To overcome this obstacle, a favored strategy relies on selecting suitable vehicles for dermatologic therapy, such as emulsions, gels and, more recently, nanoparticulate systems. AREAS COVERED: Particle-stabilized emulsions, also known as Pickering emulsions, have garnered interest in recent years. Although most of the investigation on Pickering emulsions has been based on model systems with inorganic or organic solid particles, recent advances have been made regarding the application of nanocarriers, protein-based particles or cyclodextrins for this purpose. This review reports the latest advances in Pickering emulsions technical challenges, and discusses the potential benefits and drawbacks of using these formulations for topical pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications as an alternative to conventional surfactant-based systems. EXPERT OPINION: Pickering emulsions appear as a multifunctional dosage form with endless advantages. A great deal of progress is expected in this area, which might represent a renewed vision for the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry. "
"INTRODUCTION: Psoriasis affects an estimated 2% of the world's population, with higher rates in developed countries. 80% have mild-to-moderate disease and 50 to 80% have scalp involvement. Topical treatments are the mainstay of treatment. AREAS COVERED: Two-compound calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate (BD) is a common topical combination therapy consisting of a vitamin D analogue and a corticosteroid. It comes in ointment, gel/suspension, and foam formulations. Phase II and III clinical trials have consistently shown the two-compound formulation to be effective and safe, with no clinically significant skin atrophy, calcium level changes, or adrenal suppression were seen. Topical scalp solution was also safe and effective in treating scalp psoriasis in pediatric populations. Expert commentary: Calcipotriene plus BD is more effective and safer than the individual ingredients in the same vehicle for treating body and scalp psoriasis. It should be considered a first line therapy for mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis. "
"Abstract: Cyclosporine A (CsA) has long been the mainstay treatment for dry eye syndrome (DES), one of the most common disorders of the eye. However, the poor water solubility of CsA renders it difficult to formulate it into topical ocular dosage forms. Restasis® is currently the only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved CsA formulation, while Ikervis® has recently been launched in Europe, with both commonly associated with severe ocular discomfort. Therefore, several CsA formulations have been investigated with the aim to improve bioavailability while reducing adverse effects associated with the marketed formulations. In this review, we summarize recent advances in ocular CsA delivery that provide safer and more effective alternatives for the management of DES and other ocular inflammatory conditions. "
"PURPOSE: The SANSIKA study was conducted to assess the treatment effect of 0.1% cyclosporine A cationic emulsion (CsA CE) eye drops on signs and symptoms of patients with severe dry eye disease (DED). METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, 2-parallel-arm, 6-month phase III study with a 6-month open-label treatment safety follow-up. Patients with severe DED with corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) grade 4 on the modified Oxford scale were randomized to receive once-daily CsA CE (Ikervis®) or its vehicle. RESULTS: A total of 246 patients were randomized. The proportion of patients achieving ≥2 grades improvement in CFS and a 30% improvement in symptoms (Ocular Surface Disease Index [OSDI]) by month 6 was 28.6% with CsA CE vs 23.1% with vehicle (p = 0.326) (primary endpoint). Assessment of corneal damage showed greater improvement with CsA CE over vehicle in mean adjusted CFS change from baseline to month 6 (-1.764 vs -1.418, p = 0.037). There was a reduction in ocular surface inflammation assessed by human leukocyte antigen DR expression in favor of CsA CE at month 6 (p = 0.021). The mean OSDI change from baseline was -13.6 with CsA CE and -14.1 with vehicle at month 6 (p = 0.858). The main adverse event was instillation site pain (29.2% vs 8.9% in the CsA CE and vehicle groups, respectively), and it was mostly mild. CONCLUSIONS: CsA CE was well-tolerated and effective in improving corneal damage and ocular surface inflammation and confirmed the positive benefit-risk ratio of this new formulation of CsA for the treatment of severe keratitis in DED.

"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the treatment of mild-to-moderate epidermal melasma and photodamage using a 4% hydroquinone skin care system plus tretinoin 0.02% cream. METHODS: Single-center, investigator-blinded study in 39 adult females with mild-to-moderate epidermal melasma, mild-to-marked pigmentation intensity, and Fitzpatrick skin type III to VI treated for 24 weeks. Improvements in melasma severity, pigmentation intensity, photodamage, and patient satisfaction were assessed at weeks 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24. Cutaneous tolerability was assessed by investigator (erythema, dryness, peeling) and patients (burning and stinging). Adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout. RESULTS: Melasma severity, pigmentation intensity, and melasma area and severity index (MASI) scores relative to baseline were all significantly reduced from week 4 onward (P<.001). In addition, signs of facial photodamage were significantly improved. At week 24, 87.9% of patients were ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with the overall treatment effectiveness and Quality of Life (QoL) was much improved. No patient discontinued due to lack of efficacy or treatment-related AEs. One patient (2.8%) reported severe cutaneous intolerability (erythema at week 4). CONCLUSION: Treating mild-to-moderate melasma using a 4% hydroquinone skin care system plus 0.02% tretinoin cream can significantly reduce the severity and intensity of melasma and associated pigmentation, and improve signs of photodamage within four weeks. Treatment was generally well tolerated and associated with high levels of patient satisfaction. "
"INTRODUCTION: Cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 and 2 enzyme up-regulation is involved in the pathogenetic process of actinic keratosis (A.K.) and non-melanoma skin cancers. Diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (N.S.A.I.D.) drug, is used as topical treatment of A.K. Piroxicam is a N.S.A.I.D. characterized by a high COX-1 inhibition activity. STUDY AIM: We conducted an 18 month exploratory open-label study on A.K., to assess the efficacy and tolerability of a new topical formulation of piroxicam and sunscreen in A.K. PATIENTS: Enrolled subjects applied a galenic formulation of piroxicam 0.8%, vehiculated in a topical product containing sun filters with high (50+) and broad spectrum (UVA) actions, twice a day for 6 months. Subjects were then followed up for additional 12 months. Thirty-eight subjects with a total of 69 A.K. lesions participated in the trial. The primary outcome was the evolution of the Actinic Keratosis Erythema Scale Atrophy (A.K.E.S.A) score assessing erythema, scale, and atrophy of a target A.K. lesion. Secondary outcomes were the percentage of treated lesions with complete (100%) or partial (≥75%) clearance and the evaluation skin tolerability. RESULTS: A.K.E.S.A. mean (S.D.) score at baseline was 7.5 (1.2). After 6 months of treatment, A.K.E.S.A. score decreased to 0.9 (1.1), a -88% reduction versus baseline. At the end of follow-up, A.K.E.S.A. score was 0.8 (1.2). A complete response was achieved in 38 of the 69 lesions (55%, 95% C.I.: 43% to 66%) and clearance was maintained 1 year post-treatment. A partial clearance was observed in 57 of 69 treated lesions (83%, 95% C.I.: 73% to 91%). Adverse events were limited to mild local irritation. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that 6 month topical piroxicam 0.8% is efficacious and well tolerated in A.K. Clinical efficacy is maintained 1 year post-treatment. The main limitation of our study is that it was an open label non-controlled trial. Future controlled trials are warranted in order to compare the efficacy and tolerability of this topical piroxicam preparation with standard treatments in the management of A.K. "
"Abstract: The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of MP-AzeFlu (Dymista(®) ) vs fluticasone propionate (FP), (both 1 spray/nostril bid), in children with allergic rhinitis (AR). MP-AzeFlu combines azelastine hydrochloride, FP and a novel formulation in a single spray. Children were randomized in a 3 : 1 ratio to MP-AzeFlu or FP in this open-label, 3-month study. Efficacy was assessed in children aged ≥ 6 to <12 years (MP-AzeFlu: n = 264; FP: n = 89), using a 4-point symptom severity rating scale from 0 to 3 (0 = no symptoms; 3 = severe symptoms). Over the 3-month period, MP-AzeFlu-treated children experienced significantly greater symptom relief than FP-treated children (Diff: -0.14; 95% CI: -0.28, -0.01; P = 0.04), noted from the first day (particularly the first 7 days) and sustained for 90 days. More MP-AzeFlu children achieved symptom-free or mild symptom severity status, and did so up to 16 days faster than FP. MP-AzeFlu provides significantly greater, more rapid and clinically relevant symptom relief than FP in children with AR. "
"Abstract: The current study presents the simultaneous quantification of dexpanthenol and resorcinol from marketed hair care formulation. Dexpanthenol is often present as an active ingredient in personal care products for its beautifying and invigorating properties and restorative and smoothing properties. On the other hand resorcinol is mainly prescribed for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis of scalp. The toxic side effects of resorcinol limit its use in dermatological preparations. Therefore an accurate quantification technique for the simultaneous estimation of these two components can be helpful for the formulation industries for the accurate analysis of their product quality. In the current study a high performance liquid chromatographic technique has been developed using a C18 column and a mobile phase consisting of phosphate buffer of pH = 2.8 following a gradient elution. The mobile phase flow rate was 0.6 mL per minute and the detection wavelength was 210 nm for dexpanthenol and 280 nm for resorcinol. The linearity study was carried out using five solutions having concentrations ranging between 10.34 μg·mL(-1) and 82.69 μg·mL(-1) (r (2) = 0.999) for resorcinol and 10.44 μg·mL(-1) and 83.50 μg·mL(-1) (r (2) = 0.998) for dexpanthenol. The method has been validated as per ICH Q2(R1) guidelines. The ease of single step sample preparation, accuracy, and precision (intraday and interday) study presents the method suitable for the simultaneous quantification of dexpanthenol and resorcinol from any personal care product and dermatological preparations containing these two ingredients.

"BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is one of the most widely used medications to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and recent studies have also suggested the potential benefit of the drug for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. MTX is commonly administered in oral formulations, but is often associated with systemic adverse reactions. In an attempt to address this issue, we have shown previously that a conjugate of hyaluronic acid (HA) and MTX exhibits potential as a drug candidate for intra-articular treatment of inflammatory arthritis. In this study, we compare the efficacy and safety of an optimized HA-MTX conjugate, DK226, with that of MTX in inflammatory arthritis rat models. METHODS: In vitro activity of DK226 was assessed in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (HFLS) and a synovial sarcoma cell line, SW982. Release of MTX from DK226 was investigated after incubation with rabbit synovial tissue homogenate or synovial fluid. In vivo efficacy of DK226 was evaluated in antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in the rat knee. Pharmacokinetics and hematological toxicity after treatment with oral MTX or an intra-articular injection of DK226 were compared in AIA. RESULTS: Proliferation of HFLS and SW982 cells was inhibited by DK226, and the inhibitory activity was reversed by cotreatment with excess HA or anti-CD44 antibody. MTX was released from DK226 by incubation with rabbit synovial tissue homogenate or synovial fluid at pH 4.0, but not at pH 7.4. AIA was ameliorated by intra-articular DK226, but not by HA, as potently as oral MTX. Hematological toxicity was induced by oral MTX, but not by DK226. The maximum plasma concentration of MTX after oral MTX was 40 times higher than the concentration of MTX after an intra-articular injection of DK226. Knee swelling in AIA was inhibited by intra-articular injections of DK226, but not by free MTX or a mixture of HA and MTX. In CIA, an injection of DK226 into the right knee joint significantly reduced swelling and synovial inflammation of the treated knee joint, but had no effect on the untreated contralateral knee joint. CONCLUSIONS: DK226 exerted anti-arthritic effects in two different models of arthritis. The conjugate had a wider therapeutic window than oral MTX, and could be a future drug for treatment of arthritic disorders, including inflammatory OA. "
"BACKGROUND: Oral phosphodiesterase (PDE)4 inhibitors have shown efficacy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and psoriasis. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness, local safety and tolerability, and systemic pharmacokinetics of two topical PDE4 inhibitors, roflumilast and TAK-084, in plaque psoriasis. METHODS: An intraindividual comparison of six topical products was made in 15 patients aged 18-65 years with stable chronic plaque psoriasis in an investigator-blinded, within-subject randomized study. The products evaluated were calcipotriol 0·005% cream; betamethasone valerate 0·1% (both in their marketed formulations); investigational cream formulations of roflumilast 0·5% and TAK-084 0·5% and 5%; and a vehicle cream formulation as a control. Each treatment was applied daily to different test sites located on psoriasis plaques for 3 weeks. RESULTS: The primary end point of (mean) change from baseline in skin infiltrate thickness after 3 weeks of treatment showed statistically significant improvements for all treatments: betamethasone valerate cream (-286·9 μm), the selective PDE4 inhibitors roflumilast 0·5% (-237·1 μm) and TAK-084 (0·5% cream, -153·6 μm; 5% cream, -216·7 μm) and calcipotriol 0·005% (-187·7 μm) when compared with vehicle cream control (all P < 0·001). Both the TAK-084 5% and roflumilast 0·5% formulations performed well overall compared with the potent corticosteroid, betamethasone, and were ranked better than the vitamin D analogue calcipotriol. All adverse events were mild or moderate and none was serious. CONCLUSIONS: Topical treatment with cream formulations of the PDE4 inhibitors roflumilast and TAK-084 reduced inflammation, measured as a change in skin infiltrate thickness, and reduced psoriasis severity. Corticosteroid treatments have known systemic and cutaneous side-effects; PDE4 inhibitors could offer an alternative to these and deserve further study. "
"BACKGROUND: Adapalene is a widely used topical anti-acne drug; however, it has many side effects. Liposomal drug delivery can play a major role by targeting delivery to pilosebaceous units, reducing side effects and offering better patient compliance. OBJECTIVE: To prepare and evaluate adapalene-encapsulated liposomes for their physiochemical and skin permeation properties. METHODS: A liposomal formulation of adapalene was prepared by the film hydration method and characterized for shape, size, polydispersity index (PDI), encapsulation efficiency and thermal behavior by techniques such as Zetasizer®, differential scanning calorimetry and transmission electron microscopy. Stability of the liposomes was evaluated for three months at different storage conditions. In vitro skin permeation studies and confocal laser microscopy were performed to evaluate adapalene permeation in pig ear skin and hair follicles. RESULTS: The optimized process and formulation parameters resulted in homogeneous population of liposomes with a diameter of 86.66 ± 3.5 nm in diameter and encapsulation efficiency of 97.01 ± 1.84% w/w. In vitro permeation studies indicated liposomal formulation delivered more drug (6.72 ± 0.83 μg/cm(2)) in hair follicles than gel (3.33 ± 0.26 μg/cm(2)) and drug solution (1.62 ± 0.054 μg/cm(2)). Drug concentration delivered to the skin layers was also enhanced compared to other two formulations. Confocal microscopy images confirmed drug penetration in the hair follicles when delivered using the liposomal formulation. CONCLUSION: Adapalene was efficiently encapsulated in liposomes and led to enhanced delivery in hair follicles, the desired target site for acne. "
"Abstract: Biodegradable implants are promising drug delivery systems for sustained release ocular drug delivery with the benefits such as minimum systemic side effects, constant drug concentration at the target site and getting cleared without surgical removal. Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a common disease characterized with the changes in ocular epithelia surface and results in inflammatory reaction that might lead to blindness. Cyclosporin A (CsA) is a cyclic peptide that is frequently employed for the treatment of DES and it needs to be applied several times a day in tear drops form. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vivo behavior and efficacy of the developed nano-decorated subconjunctival implant systems for sustained release CsA delivery. Biodegradable Poly-ɛ-caprolactone (PCL) implant or micro-fiber implants containing CsA loaded poly-lactide-co-glycolide (85:15) (PLGA) or PCL nanoparticles were prepared in order to achieve sustained release. Two of the formulations PCL-PLGA-NP-F and PCL-PCL-NP-I were selected for in vivo evaluation based on their in vitro characteristics determined in our previous study. In this study, formulations were implanted to Swiss Albino mice with induced dry eye syndrome to investigate the ocular distribution of CsA following subconjunctival implantation and to evaluate the efficacy. Tissue distribution study indicated that CsA was present in ocular tissues such as cornea, sclera and lens even 90 days after the application and blood CsA levels were found lower than ocular tissues. Efficacy studies also showed that application of CsA-loaded fiber implant formulation resulted in faster recovery based on their staining scores. "
"Abstract: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. However, current therapies only reach a small percentage of patients and may cause serious side effects. We propose the therapeutic use of retinoic acid-loaded nanoparticles (RA-NP) to safely and efficiently repair the ischaemic brain by creating a favourable pro-angiogenic environment that enhances neurogenesis and neuronal restitution. Our data showed that RA-NP enhanced endothelial cell proliferation and tubule network formation and protected against ischaemia-induced death. To evaluate the effect of RA-NP on vascular regulation of neural stem cell (NSC) survival and differentiation, endothelial cell-conditioned media (EC-CM) were collected. EC-CM from healthy RA-NP-treated cells reduced NSC death and promoted proliferation while EC-CM from ischaemic RA-NP-treated cells decreased cell death, increased proliferation and neuronal differentiation. In parallel, human endothelial progenitor cells (hEPC), which are part of the endogenous repair response to vascular injury, were collected from ischaemic stroke patients. hEPC treated with RA-NP had significantly higher proliferation, which further highlights the therapeutic potential of this formulation. To conclude, RA-NP protected endothelial cells from ischaemic death and stimulated the release of pro-survival, proliferation-stimulating factors and differentiation cues for NSC. RA-NP were shown to be up to 83-fold more efficient than free RA and to enhance hEPC proliferation. These data serve as a stepping stone to use RA-NP as vasculotrophic and neurogenic agents for vascular disorders and neurodegenerative diseases with compromised vasculature. "
"Abstract: A new-generation of nanoencapsulated photosensitizers could be a good solution to perform effective photodynamic therapy (PDT). In this paper, we present physicochemical characterization and cellular investigation of newly prepared long-sustained release oil-core polyelectrolyte nanocarriers loaded with verteporfin (nano VP) in relation to free VP. For this purpose, a macroscale multiwell plates and multifunctional microfluidic system (for three types of cell cultures: monoculture, coculture and mixed culture) were used. A physical analysis of nano VP showed its high stability, monodispersity with unimodal shape and highly positive charge, what made them good candidates for cancer treatment. Biological properties (cellular internalization and uptake as well as cytotoxicity) of nano and free VP were evaluated using both carcinoma (A549) and normal (MRC-5) human lung cells. It was investigated that verteporfin was accumulated in cancer cells preferentially. Low cytotoxicity of the tested photosensitizer was observed in both macro, and microscale. However, in experiments performed in the microsystem, nano VP allowed the reduction of cytotoxic effect, especially in relation to the normal cells. It could result from the specific environment of cell growth in the microsystem which can quite closely mimic the in vivo conditions. Our results suggest that the presented microsystem could be a very useful microtool for testing of new generation of photosensitizers in various configurations of cell cultures, which are difficult to perform in the macroscale. Moreover, the prepared nano VP could be successfully used for further research i.e. evaluation of PDT procedures. "
"BACKGROUND: Ciclosporin is a selective immunomodulator used for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs. A new 100 mg/ml oral solution formulation (Cyclavance®, Virbac) was developed as a pharmaceutical equivalent to the marketed capsule formulations (Atopica®, Novartis Animal Health) containing 25, 50 mg, or 100 mg of ciclosporin A. The aim of this study was to assess and compare the pharmacokinetic profiles and bioequivalence of the two formulations following a single oral administration to dogs. This randomised, two-period, two-sequence, crossover bioequivalence study was conducted in 40 healthy dogs under fasting conditions. Each dog received either one 50 mg capsule of Atopica® or 0.5 ml of Cyclavance®. After dosing, blood samples were collected during a 48-h time period at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h. Blood ciclosporin A concentrations were measured by using an HPLC-MS/MS method. Cmax, Tmax, t1/2, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and Kel were determined for the two ciclosporin formulations. Bioequivalence was to be concluded if the 90% confidence intervals were within the range of 80% to 125% for Cmax and AUC0-t. Dogs were monitored once daily throughout the study period for adverse effects. RESULTS: The 90% confidence intervals for Cyclavance®/Atopica® mean ratios of the log-transformed pharmacokinetic variables Cmax and AUC0-t were within the conventional bioequivalence range of 80% to 125% (Point estimate: 101.2% and 101.4% respectively). Except for salivation reported after administration of both products, or vomiting and diarrhoea reported after Atopica® administration, both formulations were well tolerated in the 40 healthy dogs over the 48-h study period. CONCLUSIONS: The two ciclosporin oral formulations demonstrated similar pharmacokinetic profiles and were found to be bioequivalent, and therefore, interchangeable. "
"BACKGROUND: A novel formulation of 0.05% betamethasone dipropionate in an emollient spray vehicle (DFD-01) was developed to deliver steroid to the skin layers most affected by psoriasis. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of DFD-01 to its vehicle for the treatment of moderate plaque psoriasis over 4 weeks. METHODS: Two Phase 3 trials enrolled adults with moderate psoriasis (Investigator Global Assessment [IGA]=3; 10-20% body surface area [BSA]) and randomized them 2:1 to DFD-01 or Vehicle. Products were applied twice daily to affected areas for 28 days. Treatment success was defined as an IGA=0 or 1 and ≥ 2-grade improvement from baseline. Primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving treatment success at day 15. RESULTS: Moderate psoriasis subjects were enrolled in Study 1 (174 DFD-01; 87 Vehicle) and Study 2 (182 DFD-01; 95 Vehicle). Mean BSA was 13-14%. Treatment success was achieved in significantly more subjects using DFD-01 than Vehicle at day 15 in both Study 1 (P<0.001) and Study 2 (P=0.002), and at day 29 (both studies P<0.001). Treatment success with DFD-01 was significant at day 8 in Study 1 (P=0.003) but not in Study 2 (P=0.156). Erythema, scaling, and plaque elevation scores of target lesions were significantly reduced as early as day 4 with DFD-01. Adverse events were similar between groups, with no increase between 2 and 4 weeks. CONCLUSION: These studies demonstrate DFD-01's excellent efficacy and safety for the treatment of extensive psoriasis (10-20% BSA). DFD-01 achieved treatment success in significantly more subjects than Vehicle after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment, and showed early onset of action with improved signs of erythema, scaling and elevation of target lesions after 4 days of treatment. This medium potency formulation provides a safe and effective choice for topical steroid treatment of psoriasis. "
"Abstract: As lifetime exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation has risen, the deleterious effects have also become more apparent. Numerous sunscreen and skincare products have therefore been developed to help reduce the occurrence of sunburn, photoageing, and skin carcinogenesis. This has stimulated research into identifying new natural sources of effective skin protecting compounds. Alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) was employed to assess aqueous extracts derived from soil or hydroponically glasshouse-grown roots of Althea officinalis (Marshmallow) and Astragalus membranaceus, compared with commercial, field-grown roots. Hydroponically grown root extracts from both plant species were found to significantly reduce UVA-induced DNA damage in cultured human lung and skin fibroblasts, although initial Astragalus experimentation detected some genotoxic effects, indicating that Althea root extracts may be better suited as potential constituents of dermatological formulations. Glasshouse-grown soil and hydroponic Althea root extracts afforded lung fibroblasts with statistically significant protection against UVA irradiation for a greater period of time than the commercial field-grown roots. No significant reduction in DNA damage was observed when total ultraviolet irradiation (including UVB) was employed (data not shown), indicating that the extracted phytochemicals predominantly protected against indirect UVA-induced oxidative stress. Althea phytochemical root extracts may therefore be useful components in dermatological formulations. "
"Abstract: The perpetual use of antibiotics against pathogens inadvertently altered their genes that have translated into an unprecedented resistance in microorganisms in the twenty-first century. Many researchers have formulated bactericidal and bacteriostatic inorganic nanoparticle-based antiseptics that may be linked to broad-spectrum activity and far lower propensity to induce microbial resistance than organic-based antibiotics. Based on this line, herein, we present observations on microbial abatement using gold-based zinc oxide nanostructures (Au@ZnO) which are synthesized using hydrothermal route. Inhibition of microbial growth and biofilm using Au@ZnO is a unique feature of our study. Furthermore, this study evinces antimicrobial and antibiofilm mechanisms of photo-eradiated Au@ZnO by disruption of cellular functions and biofilms via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent generation of superoxide anion radical. The present study is significant as it introduces novel functionalities to Au@ZnO in the biomedical field which can be extended to other species of microbial pathogens. "
"Abstract: TiO2-nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs) are increasingly released to the environment. The present work investigates the cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and uptake of TiO2-NPs in Triticum aestivum. Wheat seeds were exposed to 5-150 mg L(-1) of anatase (ana) or rutile + anatase (rut + ana) TiO2-NPs for 5 d. After exposure, germination and growth rates were determined. Cytotoxic effects were evaluated by changes in the cell cycle dynamics and in the membrane integrity. Genotoxicity was assessed by ploidy mutations and DNA-damage, and by mitotic abnormalities. NP uptake was analyzed by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS). Ana-TiO2 revealed higher toxicity regarding the rate of germination, but no negative effects were detected concerning growth. Although roots and shoots showed no EDS-detectable levels of Ti, despite cyto- and genotoxicity was observed in ana and rut + ana-NPs exposed roots. Cell cycle profile was formulation dependent with rut + ana presenting a higher capability to induce a cell cycle arrest at G0/G1. Both formulations induced genotoxic effects by increasing micronucleated cells: for rut + ana a dose-dependent response is evident and seems to be more genotoxic than ana at lower concentrations. Rut + ana also increased membrane permeability. The observed higher cytotoxicity of rut + ana may be explained by the higher photoactivity of this mixture. Overall, these data indicate that during germination, TiO2-NPs induce severe cyto/genotoxic effects, which are dependent on the TiO2-NP formulation. "
"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to develop and optimize deformable liposome for topical delivery of tretinoin. METHODS: Liposomal formulations were designed based on the full factorial design and prepared by fusion method. The influence of different ratio of soy phosphatidylcholine and transcutol (independent variables) on incorporation efficiency and drug release in 15 min and 24 h (responses) from liposomal formulations was evaluated. Liposomes were characterized for their vesicle size and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to investigate changes in their thermal behavior. The penetration and retention of drug was determined using mouse skin. Also skin histology study was performed. RESULTS: Particle size of all formulations was smaller than 20 nm. Incorporation efficiency of liposomes was 79-93 %. Formulation F7 (25:5) showed maximum drug release. Optimum formulations were selected based on the contour plots resulted by statistical equations of drug release in 15 min and 24 h. Solubility properties of transcutol led to higher skin penetration for optimum formulations compared to tretinoin cream. There was no significant difference between the amount of drug retained in the skin by applying optimum formulations and cream. Histopatological investigation suggested optimum formulations could decrease the adverse effect of tretinoin in liposome compared to conventional cream. CONCLUSION: According to the results of the study, it is concluded that deformable liposome containing transcutol may be successfully used for dermal delivery of tretinoin. "
"BACKGROUND: Multiple actinic keratosis (AK) lesions may arise from the cancerization of large, sun-damaged skin areas. Although photodynamic therapy (PDT) is considered the most effective therapeutic option, the efficacy and safety of field treatment of multiple AK lesions with PDT has never before been tested in a pivotal trial. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy, safety and cosmetic outcome of BF-200 ALA (a nanoemulsion formulation containing 10% aminolaevulinic acid hydrochloride) combined with the BF-RhodoLED(®) lamp for the field-directed treatment of mild-to-moderate AK with PDT. METHODS: The study was performed as a randomized, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase III trial with BF-200 ALA and placebo in seven centres in Germany. A total of 94 patients were enrolled in this study; 87 were randomized (55 patients received BF-200 ALA, 32 received placebo). Patients received one PDT. If residual lesions remained at 3 months after treatment, PDT was repeated. Illumination was performed with the PDT lamp BF-RhodoLED (635 nm ± 9 nm) until a total light dose of 37 J cm(-2) was achieved. RESULTS: BF-200 ALA was superior to placebo with respect to patient complete clearance rate (91% vs. 22%, P < 0·0001) and lesion complete clearance rate (94·3% vs. 32·9%, P < 0·0001) after a maximum of two PDTs. The confirmatory analysis of all key secondary variables supported this superiority"" should not be skipped since this is an important result. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were experienced by 100% of the BF-200 ALA group and 69% of the placebo group. The most commonly reported TEAEs were TEAEs of the application site. The cosmetic outcome was improved in the BF-200 ALA group compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Field-directed therapy with BF-200 ALA and BF-RhodoLED lamp is highly effective and well tolerated for multiple mild-to-moderate AK lesions, providing greatly improved skin quality. "
"Abstract: Methotrexate (MTX) is an immunosuppressive drug for systemic use in the treatment of skin diseases, however, MTX presents a number of side effects, such as hepatotoxicity. To overcome this limitation, this study developed skin MTX delivery surfactant systems, such as a microemulsion (ME) and a liquid crystalline system (LCS), consisting of a glycol copolymer-based silicone fluid (SFGC) as oil phase, polyether functional siloxane (PFS) as surfactant, and carbomer homopolymer type A (C971) dispersion at 0.5% (wt/wt) as aqueous phase. Polarized light microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering evidenced the presence of hexagonal and lamellar LCSs, and also a ME. Texture profile and in vitro bioadhesion assays showed that these formulations are suitable for topical application, showing interesting hardness, adhesiveness and compressibility values. Rheology analysis confirmed the Newtonian behaviour of the ME, whereas lamellar and hexagonal LCSs behave as pseudoplastic and dilatant non-Newtonian fluids, respectively. In vitro release profiles indicated that MTX could be released in a controlled manner from all the systems, and the Weibull model showed the highest adjusted coefficient of determination. Finally, the formulations were not cytotoxic to the immortalized human keratinocyte line HaCaT. Therefore, these bioadhesive surfactant systems established with PFS and C971 have great potential as skin delivery systems. "
"Abstract: The use of fixed combinations in acne vulgaris (acne) is very common, however comparative clinical trial data are limited. Cutaneous tolerability can influence patient compliance, and concerns about skin irritation with topical acne treatments have lead to a number of comparative split-face studies. Recently, a new fixed combination product was introduced (clin 1.0%-BP 3.75% gel) that was shown to be effective in reducing both inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions in moderate to severe acne. Here, we assess the tolerability of clin 1.0%-BP 3.75% gel compared with adap 0.1%-BP 2.5% gel in healthy volunteers with no apparent facial redness or dryness over 21-days, using a split-face methodology. Especially over the first two weeks of treatment, clin 1.0%-BP 3.75% gel was more tolerable than adap 0.1%-BP 2.5% gel, with statistically significant differences in cumulative change from baseline starting as early as day 8 (dryness) and day 9 (erythema), and composite index on days 8-12 and 16. Transepidermal water loss was less with clin 1.0%-BP 3.75% gel, although the difference was not statistically significant. "
"Abstract: Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic corticosteroid drug distinguished by its potent anti-inflammatory action with low systemic side effects in comparison to other corticosteroids making it a potential drug for local buccal delivery. The aim of the present study was to design mucoadhesive buccal film containing fluticasone that is aesthetically acceptable and could maintain local drug release for a sustained period to manage the sign and symptoms of severe erosive mouth lesions. Solvent casting technique was used in film preparation. Different polymeric blends were used either alone or in combination with mucoadhesive polymers, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (SCMC), or Carbopol 971P at different concentrations. The physicochemical properties, in vitro mucoadhesion time as well as the drug release properties for all prepared formulations were determined. Selected formulations with adequate properties were further examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) and subjected to in vivo evaluation. Films containing hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)/ethyl cellulose (EC) showed acceptable physicochemical properties, homogenous drug distribution, convenient mucoadhesion time, moderate swelling as well as sustained drug release up to 12 h. The biological performance of these formulations was assessed on healthy human volunteers and compared with a prepared mouthwash which showed enhanced pharmacokinetic parameters for the selected films in comparison to the mouthwash. The results revealed that the optimized formulation containing HPMC/EC and 10% SCMC could successfully achieve sustained drug release for 10 h which is considered promising for local treatment of severe mouth lesions. "
"Abstract: The pharmacodynamic effect and the safety of cyclosporine A lipid nanoparticles (CsA LN) for oral administration were investigated using Sandimmune Neoral® as reference. First, the biocompatibility of the unloaded LN on Caco-2 cells was demonstrated. The pharmacodynamic response and blood levels of CsA were studied in Balb/c mice after 5 and 10 days of daily oral administration equivalent to 5 and 15 mg/kg of CsA in different formulations. The in vivo nephrotoxicity after 15 days of treatment at the high dose was also evaluated. The results showed a significant decrease in lymphocyte count (indicator of immunosuppression) for the CsA LN groups which was not observed with Sandimmune Neoral®. CsA blood levels remained constant over the time after treatment with LN, whereas a proportional increase in drug blood concentration was observed with Sandimmune Neoral®. Therefore, CsA LN exhibited a better pharmacological response along with more predictable pharmacokinetic information, diminishing the risk of toxicity. Moreover, a nephroprotective effect against CsA related toxicity was observed in the histopathological evaluation when LN containing Tween® 80 were administered. Therefore, our preliminary findings suggest LN formulations would be a good alternative for CsA oral delivery, enhancing efficacy and reducing the risk of nephrotoxicity. "

Titanium dioxide (TiO DESIGN: Wild-type and NLRP3-deficient mice with dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis were orally administered with TiO RESULTS: Oral administration of TiO CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that individuals with a defective intestinal barrier function and pre-existing inflammatory condition, such as IBD, might be negatively impacted by the use of TiO "
"INTRODUCTION: Patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopaenia frequently experience minor and sometimes severe bleeding complications. Unrestrictive availability of safe and effective blood products is presumed by treating physicians as well as patients. Pathogen reduction technology potentially offers the opportunity to enhance safety by reducing bacterial and viral contamination of platelet products along with a potential reduction of alloimmunisation in patients receiving multiple platelet transfusions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: To test efficacy, a randomised, single-blinded, multicentre controlled trial was designed to evaluate clinical non-inferiority of pathogen-reduced platelet concentrates treated by the Mirasol system, compared with standard plasma-stored platelet concentrates using the percentage of patients with WHO grade ≥ 2 bleeding complications as the primary endpoint. The upper limit of the 95% CI of the non-inferiority margin was chosen to be a ≤ 12.5% increase in this percentage. Bleeding symptoms are actively monitored on a daily basis. The adjudication of the bleeding grade is performed by 3 adjudicators, blinded to the platelet product randomisation as well as by an automated computer algorithm. Interim analyses evaluating bleeding complications as well as serious adverse events are performed after each batch of 60 patients. The study started in 2010 and patients will be enrolled up to a maximum of 618 patients, depending on the results of consecutive interim analyses. A flexible stopping rule was designed allowing stopping for non-inferiority or futility. Besides analysing effects of pathogen reduction on clinical efficacy, the Pathogen Reduction Evaluation and Predictive Analytical Rating Score (PREPAReS) is designed to answer several other pending questions and translational issues related to bleeding and alloimmunisation, formulated as secondary and tertiary endpoints. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained in all 3 participating countries. Results of the main trial and each of the secondary endpoints will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NTR2106; Pre-results. "
"Abstract: The premature aging (photoaging) of skin characterized by wrinkles, a leathery texture and mottled pigmentation is a well-documented consequence of exposure to sunlight. UVA is an important risk factor for human cancer also associated with induction of inflammation, immunosuppression, photoaging and melanogenesis. Although herbal compounds are commonly used as photoprotectants against the harmful effects of UVA, the mechanisms involved in the photodamage are not precisely known. In this study, we investigated the effects of Aloe Vera (Aloe barbadensis mil) on the protection against UVA-modulated cell killing of HaCaT keratinocytes. Aloe Vera exhibited the remarkable ability of reducing both in vitro and in vivo photodamage, even though it does not have anti-radical properties. Interestingly, the protection conferred by Aloe Vera was associated with the maintenance of membrane integrity in both mimetic membranes and intracellular organelles. The increased lysosomal stability led to a decrease in lipofuscinogenesis and cell death. This study explains why Aloe Vera extracts offer protection against photodamage at a cellular level in both the UV and visible spectra, leading to its beneficial use as a supplement in protective dermatological formulations.

"Abstract: Phototherapy, which mainly includes photothermal treatment (PTT) and photodynamic treatment (PDT), is a photo-initiated, noninvasive and effective approach for cancer treatment. The high accumulation of photosensitizers (PSs) in a targeted tumor is still a major challenge for efficient light conversion, to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and local hyperthermia. In this study, a simple and efficient hyaluronic acid (HA)-modified nanoplatform (HA-TiO2@MWCNTs) with high tumor-targeting ability, excellent phototherapy efficiency, low light-associated side effects and good water solubility was developed. It could be an effective carrier to load hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME), owing to the tubular conjugate structure. Apart from this, the as-prepared TiO2@MWCNTs nanocomposites could also be used as PSs for tumor PTT and PDT. Those results in vitro and in vivo showed that the anti-tumor effect of this system-mediated PTT/PDT were significantly better than those of single treatment manner. In addition, this drug delivery system could realize high ratio of drug loading, sustained drug release, prolonged circulation in vivo and active targeted accumulation in tumor. These results suggest that HA-TiO2@MWCNTs/HMME has high potential for tumor synergistic phototherapy as a smart theranostic nanoplatform. "
"Abstract: Curcumin (Cur) has been demonstrated to have wide pharmacological window including anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, phototoxicity under sunlight exposure and poor biological availability limits its applicability. We have synthesized biodegradable and non-toxic polymer-poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) encapsulated formulation of curcumin (PLGA-Cur-NPs) of 150 nm size range. Photochemically free curcumin generates ROS, lipid peroxidation and induces significant UVA and UVB mediated impaired mitochondrial functions leading to apoptosis/necrosis and cell injury in two different origin cell lines viz., mouse fibroblasts-NIH-3T3 and human keratinocytes-HaCaT as compared to PLGA-Cur-NPs. Molecular docking studies suggested that intact curcumin from nanoparticles, bind with BAX in BIM SAHB site and attenuate it to undergo apoptosis while upregulating anti-apoptotic genes like BCL2. Real time studies and western blot analysis with specific phosphorylation inhibitor of ERK1 and AKT1/2/3 confirm the involvement of ERK/AKT signaling molecules to trigger the survival cascade in case of PLGA-Cur-NPs. Our finding demonstrates that low level sustained release of curcumin from PLGA-Cur-NPs could be a promising way to protect the adverse biological interactions of photo-degradation products of curcumin upon the exposure of UVA and UVB. Hence, the applicability of PLGA-Cur-NPs could be suggested as prolonged radical scavenging ingredient in curcumin containing products. "
"Abstract: Topical corticosteroids are the cornerstone of treatment for the majority of psoriasis patients. However, potential side effects of topical corticosteroids (i.e., cutaneous atrophy, telangiectasias, hypothalamic-pituitary axis suppression), coupled with the complex pathophysiology of psoriasis and the individual needs/preferences of psoriasis patients, represent a few of the limitations associated with topical corticosteroid monotherapy. While the combination of some agents with varying mechanisms of action has proven to be an effective strategy for improving efficacy and reducing concomitant drug application, others have displayed less efficacy, harm, and/or reduced cost-effectiveness. The purpose of this article is to review novel topical therapeutic combinations for the management of psoriasis and explore the role compounding pharmacies can have in providing healthcare providers and patients with effective and affordable alternative psoriasis therapies.

"Abstract: UV filters and parabens (PBs) are chemicals used in daily personal care and hygiene products to protect materials and humans from the adverse effects of UV radiation and to preserve the integrity of the formulation, respectively. Several studies highlight their widespread environmental occurrence and endocrine disrupting effects. However, little is known about human exposure to these compounds. The objective of this study was to investigate the exposure of human embryos and foetuses to endocrine disrupting UV filters and PBs. Placentas from volunteer mothers in Barcelona were collected at delivery after informed, written consent by the pregnant women. UV filters and parabens were analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The excellent performance of the method allowed measuring the target compounds in human placental tissue at low ng/g fresh weight level. The detection frequency of the selected compounds was in the range 17-100%. Benzophenone-1, methyl paraben, butyl paraben and benzyl paraben were detected in all samples. The highest measured concentration corresponded to methyl paraben, 11.77ng/g fresh weight. Reported concentrations of benzophenone-4 and benzyl paraben constitute the first evidence about their accumulation in placenta. The results obtained corroborate that foetuses are exposed to a wide diversity of UV filters and PBs via the placenta. "
"Abstract: Graphene is a multifunctional carbon nanomaterial and could be utilized to develop platform technologies for cancer therapies. Its surface can be covalently and noncovalently functionalized with anticancer drugs and functional groups that target cancer cells and tissue to improve treatment efficacies. Furthermore, its physicochemical properties can be harnessed to facilitate stimulus responsive therapeutics and drug delivery. This review article summarizes the recent literature specifically focused on development of graphene technologies to treat cancer. We will focus on advances at the interface of graphene based drug/gene delivery, photothermal/photodynamic therapy and combinations of these techniques. We also discuss the current understanding in cytocompatibility and biocompatibility issues related to graphene formulations and their implications pertinent to clinical cancer management. "
"BACKGROUND: The aim of this paper was to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of a topical gel (ACNAID TM gel medical device) containing 3% hydrogen peroxide (HPO), 1.5% salicylic acid (SA) and 4% D-panthenol (D-p) in the treatment of mild-moderate acne, comparing it with a previous formulation (ACNAID TM gel Cosmetic) containing 4% HPO, 0.5% SA, 4% D-p. METHODS: Twenty patients of both sex with mild-moderate acne have been selected. The topical gel was applied twice a day for 60 days. Evaluations included: Global Acne Grading System (GAGS); lesions count; photographic assessment; a questionnaire to assess the tolerability. The results have been compared with those obtained in a previous study conducted with the formulation containing 4% HPO, 0.5% SA, 4% D-p. RESULTS: The GAGS score showed a reduction of 43% from T0 to T1 and of 61% from T0 to T2. Count of lesions: comedones reduction of 62% from T0 to T1 and of 95% from T0 to T2; papules reduction of 49% from T0 to T1 and of 68% from T0 to T2; pustules reduction of 75% from T0 to T1 and of 100% from T0 to T2. Digital images showed a significant reduction of acne lesions. At T2 the tolerability of the topical product was excellent according to 83% of patients and good according to 17% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The topical gel has demonstrated to be effective and safe for treatment of mild to moderate acne. No patients reported side effects. These results are superior to those obtained in the previous study. "
"Abstract: Fingolimod (FNGL) is an immune-modulatory agent prescribed for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Because of its mechanism of action, FNGL is potentially a treatment for chronic, non-curable T-lymphocyte-driven inflammatory skin diseases (TLDISD) such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Since severe side effects limit the systemic administration of FNGL, the objective of this study is to develop a hydroxypropyl cellulose (2%) FNGL gel for dermatological applications. First, the effect of FNGL strength (0.05%, 0.10%, 0.50%, and 1.00%) on skin permeability and retention was investigated. We carried out several permeation studies with vertical Franz diffusion cells and (i) cellulose or (ii) excised dorsal porcine ear skin (EDPES) as membrane. We also quantified FNGL in the stratum corneum and in dermis with the tape-stripping method. Permeability parameters as well as the amount retained in skin increased significantly (p < 0.01) with strength; however, there was no statistically significant difference between the 0.50% and 1.00% gels for both cellulose and EDPES. Therefore, we selected the 0.50% gel to investigate the effect of colloidal oatmeal (0%, 1%, 3%, 6%, and 10%) on FNGL in vitro permeability and skin retention. Colloidal oatmeal has beneficial dermatological properties for TLDISD and may complement FNGL activity. Permeability increased significantly (p < 0.001) with colloidal oatmeal at the 6% and 10% strength with an enhancement ratio of 3.5 and 2.4, respectively, whereas the amount retained in the skin decreased significantly (p < 0.001) compared to the base gel. In conclusion, the 0.50% FNGL(.)HCL gel with 6% Aveeno® has very promising permeability characteristics for delivery of FNGL to the skin. "
"Abstract: The SCCS considers a maximum level of 0.01% Tagetes minuta and Tagetes patula extracts and essential oils in leave-on products (except sunscreen cosmetic products) as safe, provided that the alpha terthienyl (terthiophene) content of the Tagetes extracts and oils does not exceed 0.35%. The Tagetes extracts and oils should not be used as ingredients of sunscreen products. "
"Abstract: The treatment of various hair disorders has become a central focus of good dermatologic patient care as it affects men and women all over the world. For many inflammatory-based scalp diseases, glucocorticoids are an essential part of treatment, even though they are known to cause systemic as well as local adverse effects when applied topically. Therefore, efficient targeting and avoidance of these side effects are of utmost importance. Optimizing the balance between drug release, interfollicular permeation, and follicular uptake may allow minimizing these adverse events and simultaneously improve drug delivery, given that one succeeds in targeting a sustained release formulation to the hair follicle. To test this hypothesis, three types of polymeric nanocarriers (nanospheres, nanocapsules, lipid-core nanocapsules) for the potent glucocorticoid clobetasol propionate (CP) were prepared. They all exhibited a sustained release of drug, as was desired. The particles were formulated as a dispersion and hydrogel and (partially) labeled with Rhodamin B for quantification purposes. Follicular uptake was investigated using the Differential Stripping method and was found highest for nanocapsules in dispersion after application of massage. Moreover, the active ingredient (CP) as well as the nanocarrier (Rhodamin B labeled polymer) recovered in the hair follicle were measured simultaneously, revealing an equivalent uptake of both. In contrast, only negligible amounts of CP could be detected in the hair follicle when applied as free drug in solution or hydrogel, regardless of any massage. Skin permeation experiments using heat-separated human epidermis mounted in Franz Diffusion cells revealed equivalent reduced transdermal permeability for all nanocarriers in comparison to application of the free drug. Combining these results, nanocapsules formulated as an aqueous dispersion and applied by massage appeare to be a good candidate to maximize follicular targeting and minimize drug penetration into the interfollicular epidermis. We conclude that such nanotechnology-based formulations provide a viable strategy for more efficient drug delivery to the hair follicle. Moreover, they present a way to minimize adverse effects of potent glucocorticoids by releasing the drug in a controlled manner and simultaneously decreasing interfollicular permeation, offering an advantage over conventional formulations for inflammatory-based skin/scalp diseases.

"Abstract: The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel (Panel) assessed the safety of 16 alkyl ethylhexanoates for use in cosmetics, concluding that these ingredients are safe in cosmetic formulations in the present practices of use and concentrations when formulated to be nonirritating. The alkyl ethylhexanoates primarily function as skin-conditioning agents in cosmetics. The highest concentration of use reported for any of the alkyl ethylhexanoates is 77.3% cetyl ethylhexanoate in rinse-off formulations used near the eye, and the highest leave-on use reported is 52% cetyl ethylhexanoate in lipstick formulations. The Panel reviewed available animal and clinical data related to these ingredients, and the similarities in structure, properties, functions, and uses of ingredients from previous CIR assessments on constituent alcohols that allowed for extrapolation of the available toxicological data to assess the safety of the entire group.

"Abstract: Mammalian fetal development is easily disrupted by exogenous agents, making it essential to test new drug candidates for embryotoxicity and teratogenicity. To standardize the testing of drugs that might be used to treat pregnant women, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) formulated special grade categories, labeled A, B, C, D and X, that define the level of risk associated with the use of a specific drug during pregnancy. Drugs in categories (Cat.) D and X are those with embryotoxic and/or teratogenic effects on humans and animals. However, which stages of pregnancy are affected by these agents and their molecular mechanisms are unknown. We describe here an embryonic stem cell test (EST) that classifies FDA pregnancy Cat.D and Cat.X drugs into 4 classes based on their differing effects on primitive streak formation. We show that ~84% of Cat.D and Cat.X drugs target this period of embryogenesis. Our results demonstrate that our modified EST can identify how a drug affects early embryogenesis, when it acts, and its molecular mechanism. Our test may thus be a useful addition to the drug safety testing armamentarium. "
"Abstract: Epidermal melasma is a common hyperpigmentation disorder that can be challenging to treat. Although current treatment options for melasma are limited, topical skin-lightening preparations have widely been used as alternatives to hydroquinone. In this prospective, single-arm, open-label study, treatment of epidermal melasma with a novel cream formulation containing nicotinamide 4%, arbutin 3%, bisabolol 1%, and retinaldehyde 0.05% was associated with reductions in Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI) scores as well as total melasma surface area as measured by medical imaging software. Treatment outcomes including tolerance and safety profiles as well as patient satisfaction and product appreciation showed this novel cosmetic compound may be valuable in the treatment of epidermal melasma.

"Abstract: We assessed the tolerability and safety in rodents of a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of redaporfin, a novel photosensitizer for Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) of cancer. Two approaches were used to evaluate acute toxicity: (i) a dose escalation study in BALB/c mice to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose of redaporfin; and (ii) a safety toxicology study in Wistar rats, of a single dose of redaporfin, with or without illumination, to evaluate possible signs of systemic toxicity. Redaporfin formulation was well tolerated by mice, with no signs of adverse reactions up to 75 mg/kg. In rats, there were no relevant changes, except for a significant, but transient, increase in the blood serum markers for hepatic function and muscle integrity, and also on neutrophil counts, observed after the application of light. The overall results showed that redaporfin-PDT is very well tolerated. No abnormalities were observed, including reactions at the injection site or skin phototoxicity, although the animals were maintained in normal indoor lighting. Redaporfin also showed a high efficacy in the treatment of male BALB/c mice with subcutaneously implanted colon (CT26) tumours. Vascular-PDT with 1.5 mg/kg redaporfin and a light dose of 74 J/cm² led to the complete tumour regression in 83% of the mice. "
"BACKGROUND: Pruritus is a characteristic clinical sign of allergic skin conditions including atopic dermatitis (AD) in the dog. IL-31 is a cytokine found in the serum of some dogs with AD and can induce pruritic behaviours in laboratory beagle dogs. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to characterize an IL-31-induced pruritus model by evaluating the efficacy of prednisolone, dexamethasone and oclacitinib, and to compare the speed of anti-pruritic effects of oclacitinib against those of prednisolone and dexamethasone. ANIMALS: Purpose-bred beagle dogs were used in all studies. METHODS: Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled studies were designed to evaluate and compare the anti-pruritic properties of prednisolone, dexamethasone and oclacitinib following a single intravenous injection of recombinant canine IL-31. Video surveillance was used to monitor and score pruritic behaviours in study animals. RESULTS: Prednisolone [0.5 mg/kg, per os (p.o.)] reduced IL-31-induced pruritus when given 10 h prior to observation. When the time interval between drug treatment and observation was shortened to 1 h, dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg, intramuscular) but not prednisolone (0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced IL-31-induced pruritus. Oclacitinib (0.4 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced pruritus when given 1, 6, 11 and 16 h prior to the observation period, and the anti-pruritic activity of oclacitinib was greater when compared to prednisolone and dexamethasone at all time points assessed. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The efficacy of prednisolone, dexamethasone and oclacitinib in the IL-31-induced pruritus model gives confidence that this may be a relevant model for acute pruritus associated with allergic dermatitis including AD and can be used to evaluate novel compounds or formulations. CONTEXTE: Le prurit est un signe clinique caractéristique d'allergie cutanée comme la dermatite atopique (AD) chez le chien. L’IL‐31 est une cytokine retrouvée dans le sérum de certains chiens atopiques qui peut entrainer du prurit chez les beagles de laboratoire. HYPOTHÈSES/OBJECTIFS: Les objectifs étaient de caractériser un modèle de prurit induit par IL‐31 en évaluant l'efficacité de la prednisolone, la déxaméthasone et l'oclacitinib, et de comparer la rapidité des effets antiprurigineux de l'oclacitinib contre ceux de la prednisolone et de la déxaméthasone. SUJETS: Des chiens beagles d'expérimentation ont été utilisés dans toutes les études. MÉTHODES: Des études contrôlées contre placebo, en aveugle et randomisées ont été configurées pour évaluer et comparer les propriétés antiprurigineuses de la prednisolone, déxaméthasone et oclacitinib suivant une simple injection intraveineuse d’IL‐31 recombinante canine. Une surveillance vidéo a été utilisée pour enregistrer et noter les comportements de prurit des animaux d’étude. RÉSULTATS: La prednisolone [0.5 mg/kg, per os (p.o.)] diminuait le prurit induit par IL‐31 lorsqu'administré 10h avant l'observation. Quand l'intervalle de temps entre le traitement et l'observation était réduit à 1h, la déxaméthasone (0.2 mg/kg, intramusculaire) mais pas la prednisolone (0.25 ou 0.5 mg/kg, p.o.) diminuait le prurit induit par IL‐31. L'oclacitinib (0.4 mg/kg, p.o.) réduisait le prurit lorsqu'administré à 1, 6, 11 et 16h avant la période d'observation et l'activité antiprurigineuse de l'oclacitinib était meilleure lorsque comparé à la prednisolone et à la déxaméthasone à tous les points évalués. CONCLUSION ET IMPORTANCE CLINIQUE: L'efficacité de la prednisolone, de la déxaméthasone et de l'oclacitinib dans le modèle de prurit induit par IL‐31 permet de croire à la pertinence de ce modèle pour le prurit aigu associé à une dermatite allergique comme l’AD; il peut ainsi être utilisé pour évaluer de nouveaux composants ou formulations.

"INTRODUCTION: An innovative aerosol foam formulation of calcipotriene 0.005% (Cal) plus betamethasone dipropionate 0.064% (BD) designed to improve treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of Cal/BD aerosol foam with aerosol foam vehicle in patients with psoriasis. DESIGN: Phase III, double-blind, randomized PSO-FAST (Cal/BD foam in PSOriasis vulgaris, a Four-week, vehicle-controlled, efficacy And Safety Trial) study recruited patients with ≥ mild severity psoriasis of the trunk and/or limbs from 27 US outpatient sites (NCT01866163). Patients were randomized (3:1) to Cal/BD foam or vehicle once-daily for 4 weeks. PRIMARY OUTCOME: proportion of patients at week 4 who achieved treatment success according to physician's global assessment. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: modified (excluding head) psoriasis area and severity index (mPASI) and patient's assessment of itch (visual analog scale). Safety was monitored by adverse events/calcium homeostasis. RESULTS: 426 patients enrolled between June and October 2013 (Cal/BD foam, n=323; vehicle, n=103). At week 4, significantly more patients using Cal/BD foam achieved treatment success versus vehicle (53.3 versus 4.8%; OR 30.3, 95% CI 9.7,94.3; P < .001) and mean mPASI score was significantly lower for patients using Cal/BD foam than vehicle (2.0 versus 5.5; adjusted difference -3.3, P <.001). Significantly greater itch relief was observed for patients using Cal/BD foam than vehicle (P = .010 at day 3, P < .001 from day 5). Adverse drug reactions were reported in 10 Cal/BD foam patients (3.1%) and two vehicle patients (1.9%); events occurred in one patient each except application site pain (Cal/BD foam, two patients; vehicle, one patient). There were no clinically significant changes in calcium homeostasis. CONCLUSIONS: Cal/BD foam was efficacious, achieved rapid itch relief and was well tolerated in patients with body psoriasis. This innovative aerosol foam formulation is expected to become a valuable treatment option. "
"BACKGROUND: Over-the-counter acne treatments have assumed more importance for the dermatologist as access and affordability of prescription acne medications has decreased. AIM: This research evaluated the efficacy of a three step acne treatment regimen containing stabilized botanical anti-inflammatory ingredients as compared to a currently marketed acne regimen. METHOD: 80 female/male subjects 12+ years with mild to moderate acne (at least 10 inflammatory and 10 non-inflammatory lesions) were enrolled for 12 weeks and randomized to use the study botanical anti-inflammatory acne regimen or the traditional benzoyl peroxide comparator. Evaluations included investigator global assessment, investigator tolerability assessment, acne lesion characteristics (erythema, lesion height, diameter of inflammation, and amount of pus), subject product assessment, and digital photos at baseline, 2, 4, and 12 weeks. RESULTS: The botanical regimen outperformed the comparator in terms of target lesion erythema, height, inflammation, and pus at weeks 2 and 4, perhaps due to anti-inflammatory ingredients, however parity was reached between the two products by week 12. No difference in lesion counts between the two groups was noted at week 2, however by week 4, there was a lower lesion count with the study regimen in terms of closed comedones (P<0.001) and inflammatory (P=0.016) lesions than the comparator. This statistically significant difference continued into week 12 with a reduction in closed comedones (P=0.006) for the study regimen. CONCLUSION: Modern OTC cosmetic formulation ingredients including emollients, anti-inflammatory/antioxidants, and sensitive skin modulators provided an improved skin appearance, less lesional erythema, and a better overall appearance in subjects with acne treated for 12 weeks.

"Abstract: Eczema is characterized by itching, lichenification, scaling, oedema and erythema. Current management strategies include corticosteroids, which are limited due to side effects. Many herbal remedies are used traditionally but unfortunately have not been validated in controlled clinical trials. Three popular traditional treatments of eczema include Indian pennywort, Walnut and Turmeric. In this study three topical formulations (micro emulsion, gel and ointment) were prepared from extracts of Indian pennywort, Walnut and Turmeric. These formulations were monitored for stability for a period of three months. Controlled clinical trials were conducted on 360 eczema patients. Clinical parameters observed were degree of erythema, oedema, scaling, itching and lichenification. Effects of each formulation on these clinical parameters were compared with placebo formulations. Micro emulsion formulations in all cases proved to be more effective in reducing semi quantitative scores of erythema and oedema. Itching was relieved more by gel formulation. The ointment showed more efficacy towards scaling and lichenification. Comparison of the effects of placebo and the specific formulations was performed by chi-square statistics and found to be highly significant. In summary it is concluded that all the formulations could be used as promising source for treatment of eczema. "
"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether cyclosporine A (CsA)-based Graft vs. Host Disease (GvHD) prophylaxis with enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) instead of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or methotrexate (MTX) reduces the GvHD incidence and lowers gastrointestinal (GI-) toxicities. METHODS: In a retrospective analysis of 102 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients, incidences of overall and severe aGvHD (>II°), cGvHD as well as overall and severe (CTC >II°) GI-toxicities were compared between GvHD prophylaxis containing EC-MPS vs. MMF or MTX (control group). RESULTS: The overall aGvHD rate was significantly lower in the EC-MPS group compared to the control (47% vs. 72%, P = 0.022) with lower rates of severe aGvHD (10% vs. 25%, P = 0.088) and cGvHD (20% vs. 39%, P = 0.065). Prophylaxis with EC-MPS remained significantly associated with a lower aGvHD rate in a multiple logistic regression model. GI-toxicities did not differ between both groups except for severe abdominal pain for which the incidence was increased in the EC-MPS group (17% vs. 3%, P = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: This data support the hypothesis that replacement of MMF or MTX by EC-MPS reduces GvHD rates after HSCT. This appears not to be due to a reduced GI-toxicity of EC-MPS. "
"Abstract: The Franz cells permeation assay has been performed for over 25 years. However, the advent of nanotechnology created a whole new world, especially with regard to topical products. In this new global scenario an increasing number of nanostructure-based delivery systems (NDSs) have emerged and a global warning relating to the safety of these NDSs is arising. This work studied the efficacy of the Franz cells assay, comparing it with the radiolabeling biodistribution test. For this purpose a formulation of sunscreen based on an NDS was developed and characterized. The results demonstrated both that the NDS did not present in vitro cytotoxicity and that the radiolabeling biodistribution test is more precise for the evaluation of NDS cosmetics than the Franz cells assay, since it detected the permeation of the NDS at a picogram order. Due to this fact, and considering all the concerns related to NDSs and nanoparticles in general, more precise methods must be used in order to guarantee the safe use of these new classes of products.

"Abstract: To design nanoparticle (NP)-based drug delivery systems for pulmonary administration, biodegradable materials are considered safe, but their potential toxicity is poorly explored. We here explore the lung toxicity in mice of biodegradable nanoparticles (NPs) and compare it to the toxicity of non-biodegradable ones. NP formulations of poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) coated with chitosan (CS), poloxamer 188 (PF68) or poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), which renders 200 nm NPs of positive, negative or neutral surface charge respectively, were analyzed for their biodistribution by in vivo fluorescence imaging and their inflammatory potential after single lung nebulization in mice. After exposure, analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell population, protein secretion and cytokine release as well as lung histology were carried out. The inflammatory response was compared to the one induced by non-biodegradable counterparts, namely, TiO2 of rutile and anatase crystal form and polystyrene (PS). PLGA NPs were mostly present in mice lungs, with little passage to other organs. An increase in neutrophil recruitment was observed in mice exposed to PS NPs 24 h after nebulization, which declined at 48 h. This result was supported by an increase in interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) in BAL supernatant at 24 h. TiO2 anatase NPs were still present in lung cells 48 h after nebulization and induced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of polymorphonuclear cells to BAL. In contrast, regardless of their surface charge, PLGA NPs did not induce significant changes in the inflammation markers analyzed. In conclusion, these results point out to a safe use of PLGA NPs regardless of their surface coating compared to non-biodegradable ones. "
"Abstract: Injectable thermosensitive hydrogels have widely been studied as drug delivery systems for their minimally invasive administration and localized drug release. However, burst drug release limits clinical applications of such hydrogels. A double-component injectable formulation (microspheres-loaded hydrogel, CMs-CS-HG) was thus fabricated to eliminate the limitation. Gelation temperature, gelation time, complex viscosity and syringeability tests for CMs-CS-HG demonstrated excellent injectability. After injection, the drug-loaded chitosan-based microspheres (CMs) were localized within the hydrogel, leading to localized drug release. Moreover, CMs-CS-HG had good hemocompatibility and histocompatibility, and had non-genotoxicity and non-cytotoxicity to Kunming mice. In addition, both in vitro and in vivo methotrexate (MTX) releasing efficiencies were evaluated, demonstrating long-term sustained MTX release from MTX-loaded CMs-CS-HG. These results showed the double-component CMs-CS-HG not only maintained good injectability and biocompatibility but also prolonged drug-releasing time in comparison with the single-component CS-HG or CMs, suggesting that CMs-CS-HG may be a promising drug delivery system.

"Abstract: Since being introduced more than 30 years ago, endovaginal ultrasonography (US) and quantitative testing of serum levels of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin have become the standard means of establishing the presence of normal intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), failed IUP, and ectopic pregnancy. Appropriate use of these powerful tools requires clear, standardized interpretations based on conservative criteria to protect both the pregnancy and the mother. Since diagnoses are assigned earlier and available medical treatments for ectopic pregnancy and failed IUP are expanding, emphasis must carefully shift toward watchful waiting when the mother is clinically stable and a definitive location for the pregnancy cannot be established with US. To this end and to prevent inadvertent harm to early normal pregnancies, the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound convened a consensus panel of radiologists, obstetricians, and emergency medicine physicians in 2012 with the goal of reviewing current literature and clinical practices and formulating modern criteria and terminology for the various first-trimester outcomes.

"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common autoimmune disease in the word, affecting 1% of the population. Long-term prognosis in RA was greatly improved following the introduction of highly effective medications such as methotrexate (MTX). Despite the importance of this drug in RA, 8%-16% of patients must discontinue the treatment because of adverse effects. Last decade, we developed a promising new nanocarrier as a drug-delivery system, lipid-core nanocapsules. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the investigation reported here was to evaluate if methotrexate-loaded lipid-core nanocapsules (MTX-LNC) reduce proinflammatory and T-cell-derived cytokines in activated mononuclear cells derived from RA patients and even in functional MTX-resistant conditions. We also aimed to find out if MTX-LNC would reduce inflammation in experimentally inflammatory arthritis at lower doses than MTX solution. METHODS: Formulations were prepared by self-assembling methodology. The adjuvant arthritis was induced in Lewis rats (AIA) and the effect on edema formation, TNF-α levels, and interleukin-1 beta levels after treatment was evaluated. Mononuclear cells obtained from the synovial fluid of RA patients during articular infiltration procedures were treated with MTX solution and MTX-LNC. For in vitro experiments, the same dose of MTX was used in comparing MTX and MTX-LNC, while the dose of MTX in the MTX-LNC was 75% lower than the drug in solution in in vivo experiments. RESULTS: Formulations presented nanometric and unimodal size distribution profiles, with D[4.3] of 175±17 nm and span of 1.6±0.2. Experimental results showed that MTX-LNC had the same effect as MTX on arthritis inhibition on day 28 of the experiment (P<0.0001); however, this effect was achieved earlier, on day 21 (P<0.0001), by MTX-LNC, and this formulation had reduced both TNF-α (P=0.001) and IL-1α (P=0.0002) serum levels by the last day of the experiment. Further, the MTX-LNC were more effective at reducing the cytokine production from mononuclear synovial cells than MTX. CONCLUSION: The MTX-LNC were better than the MTX solution at reducing proinflammatory cytokines and T-cell-derived cytokines such as interferon-gamma and interleukin-17A. This result, combined with the reduction in the dose required for therapy, shows that MTX-LNC are a very promising system for the treatment of RA. "
"BACKGROUND: Acute diarrhoea is a frequent health problem in both travellers and residents that has a social and economic impact. This study compared the efficacy and tolerability of two loperamide-simeticone formulations and a Saccharomyces boulardii capsule as symptomatic treatment. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomised, single (investigator)-blind, three-arm, parallel group, non-inferiority clinical trial in adult subjects with acute diarrhoea at clinics in Mexico and India, with allocation to a loperamide-simeticone 2/125 mg caplet or chewable tablet (maximum eight in 48 h) or S. boulardii (250 mg twice daily for 5 days). OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the number of unformed stools between 0 and 24 h following the initial dose of study medication (NUS 0-24). The secondary outcome measures were time to last unformed stool (TLUS), time to complete relief of diarrhoea (TCRD), time to complete relief of abdominal discomfort (TCRAD) and the subject's evaluation of treatment effectiveness. Follow-up endpoints at 7 days were feeling of complete wellness; stool passed since final study visit; and continued or recurrent diarrhoea. SUBJECTS: In this study, 415 subjects were randomised to either a loperamide-simeticone caplet (n = 139), loperamide-simeticone chewable tablet (n = 139) or S. boulardii capsule (n = 137) and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: With regards to mean NUS 0-24, the loperamide-simeticone caplet was non-inferior to loperamide-simeticone tablets (3.4 vs. 3.3; one-sided 97.5 % confidence interval ≤0.5), with both significantly lower than S. boulardii (4.3; p < 0.001). The loperamide-simeticone groups had a shorter median TLUS [14.9 and 14.0 vs. 28.5 h (loperamide-simeticone caplet and chewable tablet groups, respectively, vs. S. boulardii); p < 0.001], TCRD (26.0 and 26.0 vs. 45.8 h; p < 0.001) and TCRAD (12.2 and 12.0 vs. 23.9 h; p < 0.005) than S. boulardii. Treatment effectiveness for overall illness, diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort relief was greater (p < 0.001) in the loperamide-simeticone groups than with S. boulardii. At 7-day follow-up most subjects reported passing stool at least once since the final study visit (loperamide-simeticone caplet 94.1 %, loperamide-simeticone chewable tablet 94.8 %, S. boulardii 97.0 %), did not experience continued or recurrent diarrhoea [loperamide-simeticone caplet 3.7 % (p < 0.03 vs. S. boulardii), loperamide-simeticone chewable tablet 3.7 %, S. boulardii 5.7 %] and felt completely well [loperamide-simeticone caplet 96.3 % (p < 0.02 vs. S. boulardii), loperamide-simeticone chewable tablet 96.3 % (p < 0.02 vs. S. boulardii), S. boulardii 88.6 %]. All treatments were well-tolerated with few adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The loperamide-simeticone caplet was non-inferior to the original loperamide-simeticone chewable tablet formulation; both formulations can be expected to demonstrate similar clinical efficacy in the relief of symptoms of acute diarrhoea. Both loperamide-simeticone formulations were superior to the S. boulardii capsule in the primary and secondary endpoints. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00807326. "
"BACKGROUND: Cough syrups are widely used in the developing world, but safety of their use in infants and children less than two years has not been well documented. Some syrups contain multiple combinations of such drugs as promethazine, diphenhydramine and ephedrine; which are individually now contraindicated in children less than two years. Despite this, the syrups are available as over the counter drugs and may be dispensed to mothers who are unaware of the potentially hazardous effects to their infants. A descriptive cross-sectional study was used to investigate suitability of cough syrups sold within Eldoret municipality for use in children less than two years of age based on their formulations and available literature. METHODS: Two semi-structured questionnaires were administered to pharmacy attendants and mothers attending sick child clinic at a referral hospital to establish whether cough syrups containing more than one active ingredient of compounds, now contraindicated in children are administered to infants, and awareness of potential serious adverse effects. Data from labeled contents of cough syrups from retail pharmacies was recorded and corroborated with information from literature to determine those deemed to contain the ingredients. The second questionnaire was administered to mothers with children less than two years to ascertain whether they had used the identified syrups. A total of 260 mothers and 55 pharmacy attendants were interviewed. RESULTS: There was widespread use of the syrups in children, including infants, with 192 (74%) of the respondents having used identified syrups and over 90% of these on children less than 2 years including those less than three months.146 (76%) mothers had administered the syrup at double the recommended dose. CONCLUSION: The regulatory authorities should make concerted efforts to discourage use of cough syrups containing ingredients that pose adverse events to infants, including campaigns to educate pharmacy workers and mothers.

"Abstract: Methotrexate is the first line of treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Since many patients become unresponsive to methotrexate treatment, only very expensive biological therapies are effective and increased methotrexate tolerance strategies need to be identified. Here we propose the encapsulation of methotrexate in a new liposomal formulation using a hydrophobic fragment of surfactant protein conjugated to a linker and folate to enhance their tolerance and efficacy. In this study we aim to evaluate the efficiency of this system to treat rheumatoid arthritis, by targeting folate receptor β present at the surface of activated macrophages, key effector cells in this pathology. The specificity of our liposomal formulation to target folate receptor β was investigated both in vitro as in vivo using a mouse model of arthritis (collagen-induced arthritis in DBA/1J mice strain). In both systems, the liposomal constructs were shown to be highly specific and efficient in targeting folate receptor β. These liposomal formulations also significantly increase the clinical benefit of the encapsulated methotrexate in vivo in arthritic mice, together with reduced expression of CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases by joint-infiltrating macrophages. Thus, our formulation might be a promising cost effective way to treat rheumatoid arthritis and delay or reduce methotrexate intolerance. "
"Abstract: The objective of present work was to develop novel sunscreen creams containing polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) of morin. Polymeric NPs containing morin were prepared and optimized. The creams containing morin NPs were also prepared and evaluated. Optimized NPs exhibited particle size of 90.6 nm and zeta potential of -31 mV. The entrapment efficiency of morin, within the polymeric NPs, was found to be low (12.27%). Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry studies revealed no interaction between morin and excipients. Transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed that the NPs were spherical in shape with approximately 100 nm diameter. Optimized NPs showed excellent in vitro free radical scavenging activity. Skin permeation and deposition of morin from its NPs was higher than its plain form. Different sunscreen creams (SC1-SC8) were formulated by incorporating morin NPs along with nano zinc oxide and nano titanium dioxide. SC5 and SC8 creams showed excellent sun protection factor values (≈40). In vitro and in vivo skin permeation studies of sunscreen creams containing morin NPs indicated excellent deposition of morin within the skin. Morin NPs and optimized cream formulations (SC5 and SC8) did not exhibit cytotoxicity in Vero and HaCaT cells. Optimized sunscreen creams showed excellent dermal safety. SC5 and SC8 creams demonstrated exceptional in vivo antioxidant effect (estimation of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione) in UV radiation-exposed rats. The optimized sunscreen creams confirmed outstanding UV radiation protection as well as antioxidant properties. "
"Abstract: In view of globally rising skin cancer rates and harmful effects exerted by sunlight throughout the ultraviolet, visible and infrared ranges, an objective, safe and comprehensive method for determining sunscreen efficacy is required in order to warrant safe sun exposure. In this study, the influence of characteristic active ingredients (chemical filters, physical filters and antioxidants) on different sunscreen indicators, including the universal sun protection factor and the radical formation ratio, was determined and compared to their influence on sun protection factor values. Spectroscopic universal sun protection factor measurements were conducted ex vivo by analyzing tape strips taken from human skin, and radical formation ratio determination was performed via electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy using porcine ear skin ex vivo. The sun protection factor determination was conducted according to ISO standards (ISO 24444:2010). It was shown that chemical filters provide a protective effect which was measurable by all methods examined (spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and erythema formation). Physical filters, when used as single active ingredients, increased protective values in universal sun protection factor and sun protection factor measurements but exhibited no significant effect on universal sun protection factor measurements when used in combination with chemical filters or antioxidants. Antioxidants were shown to increase sun protection factor values. Radical formation ratio values were shown to be influenced merely by chemical filters, leading to the conclusion that the universal sun protection factor is the most suitable efficacy indicator for the ultraviolet range.

"Abstract: Acne vulgaris is a highly prevalent dermatological disease of the pilosebaceous unit (PSU). An inability to target drug delivery to the PSU results in poor treatment efficacy and the incidence of local side-effects. Cutaneous application of nanoparticulate systems is reported to induce preferential accumulation in appendageal structures. The aim of this work was to prepare stable polymeric micelles containing retinoic acid (RA) using a biodegradable and biocompatible diblock methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(hexylsubstituted lactic acid) copolymer (MPEG-dihexPLA) and to evaluate their ability to deliver RA to skin. An innovative punch biopsy sample preparation method was developed to selectively quantify follicular delivery; the amounts of RA present were compared to those in bulk skin, (i.e. without PSU), which served as the control. RA was successfully incorporated into micelle nanocarriers and protected from photoisomerization by inclusion of Quinoline Yellow. Incorporation into the spherical, homogeneous and nanometer-scale micelles (dn < 20 nm) increased the aqueous solubility of RA by >400-fold. Drug delivery experiments in vitro showed that micelles were able to deliver RA to porcine and human skins more efficiently than Retin-A(®) Micro (0.04%), a marketed gel containing RA loaded microspheres, (7.1 ± 1.1% vs. 0.4 ± 0.1% and 7.5 ± 0.8% vs. 0.8 ± 0.1% of the applied dose, respectively). In contrast to a non-colloidal RA solution, Effederm(®) (0.05%), both the RA loaded MPEG-dihexPLA polymeric micelles (0.005%) and Retin-A(®) Micro (0.04%) displayed selectivity for delivery to the PSU with 2-fold higher delivery to PSU containing samples than to control samples. Moreover, the micelle formulation outperformed Retin-A(®) Micro in terms of delivery efficiency to PSU presenting human skin (10.4 ± 3.2% vs. 0.6 ± 0.2%, respectively). The results indicate that the polymeric micelle formulation enabled an increased and targeted delivery of RA to the PSU, potentially translating to a safer and more efficient clinical management of acne.

"Abstract: Systemic antibiotic therapy in post-operative wound care remain controversial leading to escalation in levels of multi-resistant bacteria with unwanted morbidity and mortality. Recently zinc (Zn) because of multiple biophysiological functions, gain considerable interest for wound care. Based on our current understanding, the present study was designed with an intent to produce improve therapeutic approaches for post-operative wound management using composite multi-functional antibiotic carrier. The study involved the fabrication, characterization and pre-clinical evaluation of cefazolin nanofiber mats loaded with zinc oxide (ZnO) and comparing co-formulated mats with individual component, enable a side by side comparison of the benefits of our intervention. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the drug, ZnO nanoparticles (ZnONPs) and drug-ZnONP mixture against Staphylococcus aureus was determined using micro dilution assay. The fabricated nanofibers were then evaluated for in-vitro antimicrobial activity and the mechanism of inhibition was predicted by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Further these nanofiber mats were evaluated in-vivo for wound healing efficacy in Wistar rats. Study revealed that the average diameter of the nanofibers is around 200-900 nm with high entrapment efficiency and display sustained drug release behavior. The combination of ZnO and cefazolin in 1:1 weight ratio showed higher anti-bacterial activity of 1.9 ± 0.2 μg/ml. Transmission electron microscopy of bacterial cells taken from the zone of inhibition revealed the phenomenon of cell lysis in tested combination related to cell wall disruption. Further composite medicated nanofiber mats showed an accelerated wound healing as compared to plain cefazolin and ZnONP loaded mats. Macroscopical and histological evaluations demonstrated that ZnONP hybrid cefazolin nanofiber showed enhanced cell adhesion, epithelial migration, leading to faster and more efficient collagen synthesis. Hence the fabricated composite nanofiber mats have the potential to be used as a postoperative antimicrobial wound dressings. "
"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the plaque inhibitory effect of a new 0.03 % chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) and 0.05 % cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) mouthrinse formulation and to explore patients' experience and side effects after its use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This short-term, randomized, double blind, parallel, clinical trial enrolled 150 periodontally healthy patients. These volunteers were randomly allocated to one of following mouthrinse groups (n = 50/group): 0.12 % CHX + 0.05 % CPC (Perio-Aid® Treatment alcohol-free), 0.03 % CHX + 0.05 % CPC new test formulation or to the placebo group. Clinical parameters (plaque, gingival, and stain indexes) and microbiological samples were taken at baseline, before supragingival cleaning, and after 4 days of undisturbed plaque growth, rinsing twice/day with one of the mouthrinses. RESULTS: Plaque reduction was similar for the 0.12 % CHX (-0.52 ± 0.55) and 0.03 % CHX (-0.47 ± 0.49) groups. Both showed significant reductions in plaque accumulation compared to the placebo (p < 0.001). The new formulation had less of a negative impact on taste perception when compared to the 0.12 % CHX solution. The new CHX mouthrinse was also able to control bacterial loads and reduce some periodontopathogens. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that the new 0.03 % CHX + 0.05 % CPC formulation exerted clinical efficacy similar to that achieved by an already-marketed 0.12 % CHX + 0.05 % CPC mouthrinse, but with slightly fewer side effects. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Lower CHX mouthrinse formulations could be effective in the inhibition of plaque regrowth with reduced unpleasant subjective side effects. "
"INTRODUCTION: Reducing post-interventional inflammation and pain in odontostomatological surgery procedures, such as tooth extractions, implants or oral biopsies is a relevant clinical goal. Chlorhexidine oral rinse is commonly used with this aim. Recently a new product containing chlorhexidine, dexpanthenol, allantoin and chitosan (Bexident Post [BP]) in a gel formulation has been developed. We evaluated the efficacy of BP in controlling postsurgical inflammation and pain and in promoting cicatrization in subjects undergoing molar extractions. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective sequential cross-over, randomized controlled study in patients undergoing surgical removal of at least two impacted mandibular third molars (teeth numbers 38 and 48) (numbers 17 and 32 in the Universal Tooth Numbering System), in two separate sessions, to determine the effect of BP in comparison with bicarbonate (BC) oral rinse (one spoonful in 200 ml of water), both used three times daily. Each subject utilized both products in a randomized sequential manner after each tooth extraction. Primary outcomes of the study were post-procedure pain and inflammation. Secondary outcomes were analgesic pill rescue use (metamizole 1 cap every 8 hours if needed) and an assessor-blinded evaluation of cicatrization with a semi-quantitative scale (good, satisfactory and insufficient). Post-procedure pain was assessed 6 hours after tooth extraction and for seven consecutive days by means of a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) (from 0: no pain to 10: extreme pain). The extent of inflammation was evaluated through metric measurements of facial perimeter using standardized anatomical reference points. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients (22 men and 25 women; mean age 34 years) were enrolled with a total of 94 molars extracted. Nineteen subjects applied BC as the first sequential treatment and 28 BP as the first. Before surgery no mean differences in the two treatments in inflammation measurements were observed. After surgery mean VAS pain score was similar between the two treatments in the first 6 hours (VAS score = 6.5). A marked progressive reduction in pain intensity with the use of BP was observed throughout the treatment period in comparison with BC (7 day mean scores 3.7 vs. 5.3; p = 0.0001). BP was superior to BC in reducing inflammation with -50% of the inflammation-related measurement (6 mm vs. 12 mm; p = 0.0001). Analgesic pill consumption was lower with BP in comparison with BC (13 pills vs. 24; p < 0.05). Cicatrization was scored 'good' in a higher percentage of subjects during BP use (64%) in comparison with the BC group (13%) (p = 0.0001). No serious side effects were reported with either treatment regimen. CONCLUSION: In this trial BP performed better than BC in controlling pain and inflammation in subjects undergoing dental surgery, reducing the consumption of analgesics and favoring better cicatrization.

"BACKGROUND: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common form of paediatric cancer. Maintenance therapy as last treatment phase includes oral chemotherapy with methotrexate (MTX) and mercaptopurine (6-MP), self- or parent-administered at home, given for about 1 ½ years, and qualified as decisive for an optimum therapy outcome. The aim of our study was to analyze factors influencing the adherence of patients with ALL undergoing maintenance therapy and their families. METHODS: A multi-method study was undertaken between 11/2011 and 10/2014 with patients surveyed by the Hannover Medical School outpatient clinic, including a questionnaire survey and qualitative interviews with parents as well as blood samples of the patients. RESULTS: 33 questionnaires, 27 interviews and blood samples of 26 patients could be analyzed. Only one third of the blood samples showed concentrations of the 6-MP active metabolite within the therapeutic reference range. Parents named the clinical doctor as their main advisor on medication intake. 36% (12/33) of the participants stated that medication intake has not always occurred the way medication was prescribed. Drug formulation and drug intake information could be identified as determinants of adherence. Parents' problems to obtain information are partly caused by different study results concerning the correct timing of the drug intake and drug interactions with milk products. CONCLUSION: Parents' information on drug therapy should be more consistent and the pharmaceutical formulations have to be adapted to patients' needs to improve adherence and thereby the chance of long-term remission.

"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Many herbal topical formulations have been marketed worldwide to prevent hair loss or promote hair growth. Certain in vivo studies have shown promising results among them; however, the effectiveness of their bioactive constituents remains unknown. AIM OF THE STUDY: Recently, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) inhibition has been discovered as a pharmacological mechanism for treating androgenic alopecia (AGA). This present study was aimed to identify prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTGDS) inhibitors in traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) for treating AGA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 389 constituents of 12 selected herbs were docked into 6 different crystal structures of PTGDS. The accuracy of the docking methods was successfully validated with experimental data from the ZINC In Man (Zim) database using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) studies. Seven essential drug properties were predicted for topical formulation: skin permeability, sensitisation, irritation, corrosion, mutagenicity, tumorigenicity and reproductive effects. RESULTS: Many constituents of the twelve herbs were found to have more advanced binding energies than the experimentally proved PTGDS inhibitors, but many of them were indicative of at least one type of skin adverse reactions, and exhibited poor skin permeability. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, ricinoleic acid, acteoside, amentoflavone, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside and hinokiflavone were predicted to be PTGDS inhibitors with good pharmacokinetic properties and minimal adverse skin reactions. These compounds have the highest potential for further in vitro and in vivo investigation with the aim of developing safe and high-efficacy hair loss treatment. "
"Abstract: Clinicians often face complex decisions regarding off-target drug effects, both in diagnosis and treatment. A key component in the formulation of the correct diagnosis is the temporal relationship between drug introduction and adverse effect. The sentinel injury may target the gut and brain. The description of the complaint may vary among providers. Modeling Information visualization for clinicians in real time will require the integration of time-stamped data with organ-specific complaints. "
"Abstract: Six different commercial forms and sizes of titanium dioxide particles were tested in separate developmental toxicity assays. The three pigment-grade (pg) or 3 ultrafine (uf)/nanoscale (anatase and/or rutile) titanium dioxide (TiO2) particle-types were evaluated for potential maternal and developmental toxicity in pregnant rats by two different laboratories. All studies were conducted according to OECD Guideline 414 (Prenatal Developmental Toxicity Study). In addition, all test materials were robustly characterized. The BET surface areas of the pg and uf samples ranged from 7 to 17 m(2)/g and 50-82 m(2)/g respectively (see Table 1). The test substances were formulated in sterile water. In all of the studies, the formulations were administered by oral gavage to time-mated rats daily beginning around the time of implantation and continuing until the day prior to expected parturition. In 3 of the studies (uf-1, uf-3, & pg-1), the formulations were administered to Crl:CD(SD) rats beginning on gestation day (GD) 6 through GD 20. In 3 additional studies (uf-2, and pg-2, pg-3 TiO2 particles), the formulations were administered to Wistar rats beginning on GD 5 through 19. The dose levels used in all studies were 0, 100, 300, or 1000 mg/kg/day; control group animals were administered the vehicle. During the in-life portions of the studies, body weights, food consumption, and clinical observations before and after dosing were collected on a daily basis. All dams were euthanized just prior to expected parturition (GD 21 for Crl:CD(SD) rats and GD 20 for Wistar rats). The gross necropsies included an examination and description of uterine contents including counts of corpora lutea, implantation sites, resorptions, and live and dead fetuses. All live fetuses were sexed, weighed, and examined externally and euthanized. Following euthanasia, fresh visceral and head examinations were performed on selected fetuses. The fetal carcasses were then processed and examined for skeletal alterations. There was no evidence of maternal or developmental toxicity at any dose level tested in any of the six studies. Based on these results, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for titanium dioxide was 1000 mg/kg/day, the highest administered dose, in both the Sprague-Dawley (Crl:CD(SD) and Wistar rat strains.

"Abstract: Nanoparticles are increasingly being utilised in the innovation of consumer product formulations to improve their characteristics; however, established links between their properties, dose and cytotoxicity are not well defined. The purpose of this study was to screen four different nanomaterials of interest to oral care product development in the absence of stabilisers, alongside their respective bulk equivalents, within a non-keratinised oral epithelial cell model (H376). Particle morphology and size were characterised using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The H376 model showed that zinc oxide (ZnO) was the most cytotoxic material at concentrations exceeding 0.031% w/v, as assessed using the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and dimethylthiazolyl-diphenyl-tetrazolium-bromide (MTT) assays. ZnO cytotoxicity does not appear to be dependent upon size of the particle; a result supported by SEM of cell-particle interactions. Differences in cytotoxicity were observed between the bulk and nanomaterial forms of hydroxyapatite and silica (SiO2); titanium dioxide (TiO2) was well tolerated in both forms at the doses tested. Overall, nano-size effects have some impact on the cytotoxicity of a material; however, these may not be as significant as chemical composition or surface properties. Our data highlights the complexities involved at the nano-scale, in both the characterisation of materials and in relation to cytotoxic properties exerted on oral epithelial cells. "
"BACKGROUND: This randomized, partially single-blinded, 6-period crossover clinical study of adult smokers compared the nicotine pharmacokinetics, impacts on smoking urge and tolerability of various formulations of one brand of e-cigarettes with that of a tobacco cigarette. METHODS: Five e-cigarettes with different e-liquid formulations containing 1.6 % and 2.4 % nicotine and a conventional tobacco cigarette were randomized among 24 subjects under two exposure sessions consisting of a 30-min controlled and a one-hour ad lib use period to assess plasma nicotine levels, impacts on smoking urge and adverse events. The 30-min controlled use session comprised an intensive use of the e-cigarettes with a total of 50 puffs taken every 30 s for comparison to a single conventional cigarette having a typical machine-measured nicotine yield (~0.8 mg). Ad lib product use conditions provided insight into more naturalistic product use behaviors and their accompanying smoking urge reductions. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed by the Principal Investigator. RESULTS: Significant (p < 0.05) increases in plasma nicotine concentrations occurred within 10 min of controlled e-cigarette use and significant (p < 0.001) reductions from baseline smoking urge were observed within 5 min. E-cigarette and cigarette nicotine plasma levels were comparable for up to one hour of use. After both sessions (90 min), nicotine exposure was the highest for the cigarette, with all e-cigarettes showing 23 % to 53 % lower plasma concentrations. During controlled use, peak reduction in smoking urge for e-cigs occurred later than for the cigarette. After completion of both sessions, significant smoking urge reduction persisted for most of the tested e-cigarettes, albeit at levels lower than that provided by the tobacco cigarette. Nicotine content, vehicle differences, and the presence of menthol did not significantly affect smoking urge reduction by the e-cigarettes. No subjects were discontinued due to AEs. The most frequently reported AEs events included cough, throat irritation, headache, and dizziness. CONCLUSIONS: Blood plasma nicotine levels obtained from short-term use of e-cigarettes containing 1.6 % and 2.4 % nicotine were significant, but lower than those of conventional tobacco cigarettes, yet the reduction in craving symptoms were broadly comparable. The types of AEs were consistent with other research studies of longer duration that have reported that use of e-cigarettes by adult smokers is well-tolerated.

"Abstract: Rosacea is a common chronic inflammatory disorder that affects approximately 16 million Americans. The multifactorial pathophysiology of rosacea is not fully understood. Several new treatment options were recently US Food and Drug Administration approved or are in clinical trials. This paper reviews new treatment options including ivermectin, brimonidine, the new foam formulation of azelaic acid, and oxymetazoline. The potential role in therapy, patient selection, and adverse effects of these agents are discussed. "
"Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a non-invasive combinatorial therapeutic modality using light, photosensitizer (PS), and oxygen used for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. When PSs in cells are exposed to specific wavelengths of light, they are transformed from the singlet ground state (S₀) to an excited singlet state (S₁-Sn), followed by intersystem crossing to an excited triplet state (T₁). The energy transferred from T₁ to biological substrates and molecular oxygen, via type I and II reactions, generates reactive oxygen species, (¹O₂, H₂O₂, O₂*, HO*), which causes cellular damage that leads to tumor cell death through necrosis or apoptosis. The solubility, selectivity, and targeting of photosensitizers are important factors that must be considered in PDT. Nano-formulating PSs with organic and inorganic nanoparticles poses as potential strategy to satisfy the requirements of an ideal PDT system. In this review, we summarize several organic and inorganic PS carriers that have been studied to enhance the efficacy of photodynamic therapy against cancer. "
"Abstract: The rose-hip oil holds skin regenerating properties with applications in the dermatological and cosmetic area. Its nanoencapsulation might favor the oil stability and its incorporation into hydrophilic formulations, besides increasing the contact with the skin and prolonging its effect. The aim of the present investigation was to develop suitable rose-hip-oil-loaded nanocapsules, to verify the nanocapsule effect on the UV-induced oxidation of the oil and to obtain topical formulations by the incorporation of the nanocapsules into chitosan gel and film. The rose-hip oil (500 or 600 μL), polymer (Eudragit RS100®, 100 or 200 mg), and acetone (50 or 100 mL) contents were separately varied aiming to obtain an adequate size distribution. The results led to a combination of the factors acetone and oil. The developed formulation showed average diameter of 158 ± 6 nm with low polydispersity, pH of 5.8 ± 0.9, zeta potential of +9.8 ± 1.5 mV, rose-hip oil content of 54 ± 1 μL/mL and tendency to reversible creaming. No differences were observed in the nanocapsules properties after storage. The nanoencapsulation of rose-hip oil decreased the UVA and UVC oxidation of the oil. The chitosan gel and film containing rose-hip-oil-loaded nanocapsules showed suitable properties for cutaneous use. In conclusion, it was possible to successfully obtain rose-hip-oil-loaded nanocapsules and to confirm the nanocapsules effect in protecting the oil from the UV rays. The chitosan gel and film were considered interesting alternatives for incorporating the nanoencapsulated rose-hip oil, combining the advantages of the nanoparticles to the advantages of chitosan. "
"Abstract: Microemulsions combine the advantages of emulsions with those of nanocarriers, overcoming the stability problems of the former and providing facile scalable systems with compartments adequate for high drug loadings. Recently, microemulsions are gaining attention in the formulation of anticancer drugs not only for topical treatment, but also for systemic delivery as well as for the development of theranostic systems. The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, an updated review about general features, preparation, characterization and pharmaceutical applications, with a special focus on colorectal cancer, is provided. Second, a case study of formulation of methotrexate in microemulsions is presented. Various essential oils (menthol, trans-anethole, α-tocopherol) and surfactants (TPGS-1000, Maxemul 6112, Noigen RN-20) were investigated for the preparation of o/w microemulsions for the delivery of methotrexate, and the ability of methotrexate-loaded microemulsions to inhibit cancer cell growth was then evaluated. Disregarding the surfactants used, menthol and trans-anethole led to cytotoxic microemulsions, whereas α-tocopherol based-formulations induced cell proliferation. These findings highlight the role that the oily component may play in the efficacy and safety of the microemulsions. "
"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is responsible for sunburns, skin cancer, photoaging, and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The awareness on preventing these deleterious effects made the use of anti-UVB formulations an important part of population habits; however, despite the availability of several antioxidants capable of ROS scavenging, the pharmaceutical market lacks products associating UV filters with natural compounds of proven efficacy. Here, we investigated the effect of rutin, a flavonoid with antioxidant activity, associated with UVB filters in dermocosmetic preparations. METHODS: Formulations were assessed through its antioxidant activity, in vitro photoprotective effectiveness, photostability, and in vivo skin tolerance (hydration, transepidermal water loss, and erythema). RESULTS: Samples containing rutin were compatible with the human skin and presented a pronounced antioxidant potential, with scavenging activity values 75% higher than the ones containing only UVB filters. Although rutin could not prevent the sunscreens photodegradation post-irradiation, the bioactive compound significantly increased the formulations critical wavelengths, showing a photoprotective gain, especially in the UVA range. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the absorption in the UVA range, coupled with ROS scavenging potential, proved the positive effect of rutin applied to anti-UVB formulations, making this bioactive compound a promising candidate for photoprotection improvement.

"Abstract: Phytantriol- and glycerol monooleate-based cubosomes were produced and characterized as a targeted and sustained transdermal delivery system for capsaicin. The cubosomes were prepared by emulsification and homogenization of phytantriol (F1), glycerol monooleate (F2), and poloxamer dispersions, characterized for morphology and particle size distribution by transmission electron microscope and photon correlation spectroscopy. Their Im3m crystallographic space group was confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering. An in vitro release study showed that the cubosomes provided a sustained release system for capsaicin. An in vitro diffusion study conducted using Franz diffusion cells indicated that the skin retention of capsaicin from cubosomes in the stratum corneum was much higher (2.75±0.22 μg versus 4.32±0.13 μg, respectively) than that of capsaicin cream (0.72±0.13 μg). The stress testing showed that the cubosome formulations were stable under strong light and high temperature for up to 10 days. After multiapplications on mouse skin, the irritation of capsaicin cubosomes and cream was light with the least amount of side effects. Overall, the present study demonstrated that cubosomes may be a suitable skin-targeted and sustained delivery system for the transdermal administration of capsaicin. "
"Abstract: Data generated using standardized testing protocols for toxicity studies generally provide reproducible and reliable results for establishing safe levels and formulating risk assessments. The findings of three OECD guideline-type oral toxicity studies of different duration in rats are summarized in this publication; each study evaluated different titanium dioxide (TiO2) particles of varying sizes and surface coatings. Moreover, each study finding demonstrated an absence of any TiO2 -related hazards. To briefly summarize the findings: 1) In a subchronic 90-day study (OECD TG 408), groups of young adult male and female rats were dosed with rutile-type, surface-coated pigment-grade TiO2 test particles (d50 = 145 nm - 21% nanoparticles by particle number criteria) by oral gavage for 90 days. The no-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for both male and female rats in this study was 1000 mg/kg bw/day, the highest dose tested. The NOAEL was determined based on a lack of TiO2 particle-related adverse effects on any in-life, clinical pathology, or anatomic/microscopic pathology parameters; 2) In a 28-day repeated-dose oral toxicity study (OECD TG 407), groups of young adult male rats were administered daily doses of two rutile-type, uncoated, pigment-grade TiO2 test particles (d50 = 173 nm by number) by daily oral gavage at a dose of 24,000 mg/kg bw/day. There were no adverse effects measured during or following the end of the exposure period; and the NOAEL was determined to be 24,000 mg/kg bw/day; 3) In an acute oral toxicity study (OECD TG 425), female rats were administered a single oral exposure of surface-treated rutile/anatase nanoscale TiO2 particles (d50 = 73 nm by number) with doses up to 5000 mg/kg and evaluated over a 14-day post-exposure period. Under the conditions of this study, the oral LD50 for the test substance was >5000 mg/kg bw. In summary, the results from these three toxicity studies - each with different TiO2 particulate-types, demonstrated an absence of adverse toxicological effects. Apart from reporting the findings of these three studies, this publication also focuses on additional critical issues associated with particle and nanotoxicology studies. First, describing the detailed methodology requirements and rigor upon which the standardized OECD 408 guideline subchronic oral toxicity studies are conducted. Moreover, an attempt is made to reconcile the complex issue of particle size distribution as it relates to measurements of nanoscale and pigment-grade TiO2 particles. Clearly this has been a confusing issue and often misrepresented in the media and the scientific literature. It is clear that the particle-size distribution for pigment-grade TiO2, contains a small (""tail"") component of nanoscale particles (i.e., 21% by particle number and <1% by weight in the test material used in the 90-day study). However, this robust particle characterization finding should not be confused with mislabeling the test materials as exclusively in the nanoscale range. Moreover, based upon the findings presented herein, there appears to be no significant oral toxicity impact contributed by the nanoscale component of the TiO2 Test Material sample in the 90-day study. Finally, it seems reasonable to conclude that the study findings should be considered for read-across purposes to food-grade TiO2 particles (e.g., E171), as the physicochemical characteristics are quite similar.

"Abstract: We have synthesized a well-defined four-arm star amphiphilic block copolymer [poly(DLLA)-b-poly(NVP)]4 [star-(PDLLA-b-PNVP)4] that consists of D,L-lactide (DLLA) and N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP) via the combination of ring-opening polymerization (ROP) and xanthate-mediated reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. Synthesis of the polymer was verified by 1H NMR spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The amphiphilic four-arm star block copolymer forms spherical micelles in water as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Pyrene acts as a probe to ascertain the critical micellar concentration (cmc) by using fluorescence spectroscopy. Methotrexate (MTX)-loaded polymeric micelles of star-(PDLLA15-b-PNVP10)4 amphiphilic block copolymer were prepared and characterized by fluorescence and TEM studies. Star-(PDLLA15-b-PNVP10)4 copolymer was found to be significantly effective with respect to inhibition of proliferation and lysis of human and murine lymphoma cells. The amphiphilic block copolymer causes cell death in parental and MTX-resistant Dalton lymphoma (DL) and Raji cells. The formulation does not cause hemolysis in red blood cells and is tolerant to lymphocytes compared to free MTX. Therapy with MTX-loaded star-(PDLLA15-b-PNVP10)4 amphiphilic block copolymer micelles prolongs the life span of animals with neoplasia by reducing the tumor load, preventing metastasis and augmenting CD8+ T cell-mediated adaptive immune responses.

"Abstract: Efficient UV-absorbing molecules are designed to protect against UV-light exposure. However, the development of photostable sunscreens is important to preserve the photoprotective efficacy and to prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and photodegradation products, which can promote phototoxic or photoallergic contact dermatitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of mangiferin and naringenin on the photostability and phototoxicity of sunscreens containing avobenzone. Cosmetic sunscreen formulations containing octocrylene (OCT), octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC) and avobenzone (AVO) were prepared and supplemented or not with mangiferin, naringenin, or with both compounds in combination. For photostability studies, samples of the formulations were spread onto glass plates, exposed to UVA radiation and then analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine UV filters and the antioxidants recovery. The phototoxicity of the UV filters and antioxidants was evaluated using 3T3 fibroblast cultures that were subjected (or not) to irradiation according to OECD TG 432. The photostability studies demonstrated that AVO and naringenin showed the highest photodegradation when present in formulation FN (containing octocrylene, avobenzone, octyl methoxycinnamate and naringenin). The addition of mangiferin to this combination (FMN) resulted in an improved photostability of both substances compared to FN. The in vitro phototoxicity test showed that only avobenzone was considered phototoxic. The combination containing AVO/naringenin exhibited phototoxic potential; however, this was reduced by the addition of mangiferin (combination CMN). The results of this study are promising because it was demonstrated that mangiferin could increase the photostability and reduce the phototoxic potential of the combination of naringenin and AVO. "
"Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are components of the innate immune system in many species of animals. Their diverse spectrum of activity against microbial pathogens, both as innate defense molecules and immunomodulators, makes them attractive candidates for the development of a new generation of antibiotics. Although the potential immunogenicity of AMPs means they are not suitable for injection and their susceptibility to digestive peptidases is likely to reduce their oral efficacy, they are ideal for topical formulations such as lotions, creams, shampoos, and wound dressings and could therefore be valuable products for the cosmetic industry. In this context, short AMPs (<20 amino acids) lacking disulfide bonds combine optimal antimicrobial activity with inexpensive chemical synthesis and are therefore more compatible with large-scale production and the modifications required to ensure stability, low toxicity, and microbial specificity. Proof-of-concept for the application of AMPs as novel anti-infectives has already been provided in clinical trials. This perspective considers the anti-infective properties of short AMPs lacking disulfide bonds, which are active against dermatologically important microflora. We consider the challenges that need to be addressed to facilitate the prophylactic application of AMPs in personal care products. "
"INTRODUCTION: Topical retinoids are considered to be the first-line agents and maintenance therapy of acne; however, irritation side effects are major concern issues. Noncomedogenic moisturizers are sometimes added to relieve cutaneous irritations. This study aimed to compare tolerability and efficacy of moisturizers containing licochalcone A, l-carnitine and 1,2-decanediol (active formulation) with a placebo in mild to moderate severe acne in Asian subjects. METHODS: This was an 8-week double-blind, prospective, randomized controlled study. All patients (n = 120) were randomized equally into three groups: (A) adapalene gel, (B) adapalene gel with the active formulation and (C) adapalene gel with the placebo. The severity of acne, skin bioengineering measurements and skin tolerability were recorded during the study. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, the active formulation group showed significant reductions in inflammatory lesions and total lesions at the end of the study without flare-up. Moreover, skin irritations were less detected than in the other two groups by corneometer and transepidermal water loss measurements. CONCLUSIONS: The concomitant usage of adapalene gel and the moisturizer containing licochalcone A, l-carnitine and 1,2-decanediol could reduce undesirable side effects without interfering the efficacy of adapalene. This moisturizer may be superior to placebo to prevent cutaneous irritations and enhance patients' adherence to acne medications. "
"Abstract: Retinoids play a very important role in the topical treatment of acne vulgaris. However, their use is restricted because of the limited photostability responsible for local adverse effects as erythema, dryness, itching, and stinging. In this way, the therapeutic efficacy of such molecules is strongly reduced, resulting, at the same time, harmful for the patient upon light exposure. Thus, a suitable technological strategy is necessary to increase retinoid stability in order to have a product both safe and efficacious. With this aim, new inorganic-organic hybrids based on tretinoin (retinoic acid, RET) and hydrotalcite-like compounds (HTlc) have been prepared and well characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, inductively coupled plasma spectrometry, thermal analyses, scanning electron microscopy, and UV-Vis spectrophotometric measurements. Such hybrids, namely, ZnAl-HTlc-RET and MgAl-HTlc-RET, were formulated as simple gels for topical use and submitted to further studies in order to evaluate their rheological properties, photostability, and RET release capability. The RET photostability resulted improved upon intercalation into HTlc, both in MgAl-HTlc and ZnAl-HTlc, as proved by the data acquired during irradiation of the sample at 366 nm. This strategy is suitable for the realization of safe, efficacious, and compliant topical formulations for acne treatment. "
"Abstract: Strawberry polyphenols have been extensively studied over the last two decades for their beneficial properties. Recently, their possible use in ameliorating skin conditions has also been proposed; however, their role in preventing UVA-induced damage in cosmetic formulation has not yet been investigated. Skin is constantly exposed to several environmental stressors, such as UVA radiation, that induce oxidative stress, inflammation and cell death via the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the present study, we assessed the potential photoprotective capacity of different strawberry-based formulations, enriched with nanoparticles of Coenzyme Q10 and with sun protection factor 10 (SPF10), in human dermal fibroblasts (HuDe) exposed to UVA radiation. We confirmed that strawberries are a very rich source of polyphenols, anthocyanins and vitamins, and possess high total antioxidant capacity. We also showed that strawberry extracts (25 μg/mL-1 mg/mL) exert a noticeable photoprotection in HuDe, increasing cell viability in a dose-dependent way, and that these effects are potentiated by the presence of CoQ10red (100 μg/mL). We have demonstrated for the first time that the topical use of strawberry extract may provide good photoprotection, even if more in-depth studies are strongly encouraged in order to evaluate the cellular and molecular effects of strawberry protection.

"OBJECTIVE: Cotton functionalisation with poly-ɛ-caprolactone (PCL) micro- and nano-capsules containing menthol was carried out with the aim of introducing a long-lasting refreshing sensation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The preparation of the polymer micro- and nano-capsules was carried out by solvent displacement technique. A confined impinging jets mixer was used in order to ensure fast mixing and generate a homogeneous environment where PCL and menthol can self-assemble. RESULTS: The micro- and nano-capsules and the functionalised fabrics were characterised by means of DSC, FT-IR spectroscopy and SEM imaging. Micro- and nano-capsules of different size, from about 200 to about 1200 nm, were obtained varying menthol to PCL ratio (from 0.76 to 8), overall concentration and flow rate (i.e. mixing conditions). The inclusion of menthol was confirmed by DSC analysis. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: A patch test was carried out by 10 volunteers. Micro-capsules were found to be effective in conferring the fabric a refreshing sensation without altering skin physiology. "
"Abstract: Rosacea is a chronic relapsing skin disorder primarily affecting the face. Although its etiology is not well defined, rosacea is associated with immune dysregulation and inflammation potentiated by external factors. These manifestations lead to skin sensitivity and impaired quality of life. Azelaic acid (AzA) is approved for the treatment of rosacea in a 15% gel formulation. This phase 3 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of AzA in a 15% foam formulation for the treatment of papulopustular rosacea (PPR). Coprimary efficacy end points were treatment success according to investigator global assessment (IGA) and the nominal change in inflammatory lesion count (ILC) from baseline to the end of treatment (EoT). Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated as a measure of safety. The IGA success rate at EoT was significantly greater in the AzA foam group versus vehicle (P<.001; Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test). Likewise, nominal ILC change at EoT in the AzA foam group showed a significantly greater decrease versus vehicle (P<.001; F test). Drug-related AEs were mainly mild to moderate, cutaneous, and local. Overall, the study results support the efficacy and safety of twice-daily AzA foam 15% in patients with PPR. "
"Abstract: There is an ongoing debate on the use of a single concentration time point C2 for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and exposure prediction for cyclosporine. The objective of the present work was to evaluate the relationship between the peak concentration (Cmax ) versus area under the curve (AUC) for cyclosporine. Using published data from renal transplant patients from an 8-12 week study with two formulations, a simple linear regression model represented by AUC - cyclosporine = Cmax - Cyclosporine × 3.9965 + 384.5 (r = 0.9647; p < 0.001) was developed. Using the regression equation, predictions of AUC from the reported Cmax data were performed; the fold difference between observed vs predicted AUC was computed and the root mean square error for the prediction was calculated. While all but one of the predicted AUCs were contained within a 0.5-2-fold difference (99.1%), a greater proportion of the AUC values were predicted within a narrower range of 0.75 to 1.5-fold difference (78.2%), suggesting the utility of Cmax as the right surrogate for predicting the AUC for cyclosporine with a correlation coefficient of 0.8698 (n = 126; p < 0.001) and a RMSE of 26.2%. Since the time to Cmax generally varies from 1 to 2 h, although the results validate the use of C2, there may be an opportunity to explore the suitability of C1 or C1.5 in a prospective study for the purpose of TDM and AUC prediction of cyclosporine.

"Abstract: Topical glucocorticosteroids were incorporated into nanocarrier-based formulations, to overcome side effects of conventional formulations and to achieve maximum skin deposition. Nanoparticulate carriers have the potential to prolong the anti-inflammatory effect and provide higher local concentration of drugs, offering a better solution for treating dermatological conditions and improving patient compliance. Nanoparticles were formulated with poly-ϵ-caprolactone as the polymeric core along with stearic acid as the fatty acid, for incorporation of betamethasone-21-acetate. Oleic acid was applied as the coating fatty acid. Improvement of the drug efficacy, and reduction in drug degradation with time in the encapsulated form was examined, while administering it locally through controlled release. Nanoparticles were spherical with mean size of 300 nm and negatively charged surface. Encapsulation efficiency was 90%. Physicochemical stability in aqueous media of the empty and loaded nanoparticles was evaluated for six months. Drug degradation was reduced compared to free drug, after encapsulation into nanoparticles, avoiding the potency decline and promoting a controlled drug release over one month. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermal analysis confirmed drug entrapment, while cytotoxicity studies performed in vitro on human keratinocytes, Saccharomyces cerevisiae models and Artemia salina, showed a dose-response relationship for nanoparticles and free drug. In all models, drug loaded nanoparticles had a greater inhibitory effect. Nanoparticles increased drug permeation into lipid membranes in vitro. Preliminary safety and permeation studies conducted on rats, showed betamethasone-21-acetate in serum after 48 h application of a gel containing nanoparticles. No skin reactions were observed. In conclusion, the developed nanoparticles may be applied as topical treatment, after encapsulation of betamethasone-21-acetate, as nanoparticles promote prolonged drug release, increase drug stability in aqueous media, reducing drug degradation, and increase drug permeability through lipid membranes.

"Abstract: Photocopiers emit high levels of nanoparticles (PM0.1). To-date little is known of physicochemical composition of PM0.1 in real workplace settings. Here we perform a comprehensive physicochemical and morphological characterization of PM0.1 and raw materials (toners and paper) at eight commercial photocopy centers that use color and monochrome photocopiers over the course of a full week. We document high PM0.1 exposures with complex composition and several ENM in toners and PM0.1. Daily geometric mean PM0.1 concentrations ranged from 3700 to 34000 particles/cubic-centimeter (particles/cm(3)) (GSD 1.4-3.3), up to 12 times greater than background, with transient peaks >1.4 million particles/cm(3). PM0.1 contained 6-63% organic carbon, <1% elemental carbon, and 2-8% metals, including iron, zinc, titania, chromium, nickel and manganese, typically in the <0.01-1% range, and in agreement with toner composition. These findings document widespread ENM in toner formulations and high nanoparticle exposures are an industry-wide phenomenon. It further calls attention to the need to substantially redesign the interface of this technology with workers and consumers. "
"Abstract: The world coastal-zone population and coastal tourism are expected to grow during this century. Associated with that, there will be an increase in the use of sunscreens and cosmetics with UV-filters in their formulation, which will make coastal regions worldwide susceptible to the impact of these cosmetics. Recent investigations indicate that organic and inorganic UV-filters, as well as many other components that are constituents of the sunscreens, reach the marine environment--directly as a consequence of water recreational activities and/or indirectly from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) effluents. Toxicity of organic and inorganic UV filters has been demonstrated in aquatic organism. UV-filters inhibit growth in marine phytoplankton and tend to bioaccumulate in the food webs. These findings together with coastal tourism data records highlight the potential risk that the increasing use of these cosmetics would have in coastal marine areas. Nevertheless, future investigations into distribution, residence time, aging, partitioning and speciation of their main components and by-products in the water column, persistence, accumulation and toxicity in the trophic chain, are needed to understand the magnitude and real impact of these emerging pollutants in the marine system.

"Abstract: Metal oxide nanoparticles in sunscreens provide broad-spectrum ultraviolet protection to skin. All studies to assess dermal penetration of nanoparticles have unanimously concluded that the overwhelming majority of nanoparticles remain on the outer surface of the skin. However, possibly due to many different experimental protocols in use, conclusions over the potential penetration to viable skin are mixed. Here, we review several factors that may influence experimental results for dermal penetration including the species studied (human, or animal model), size and coating of the metal oxide nanoparticles, composition of the sunscreen formulation, site of sunscreen application, dose and number of applications, duration of the study, types of biological samples analysed, methods for analysing samples, exposure to UV and skin flexing. Based on this information, we suggest an appropriate research agenda involving international collaboration that maximises the potential for dermal absorption of nanoparticles, and their detection, under normal conditions of sunscreen use by humans. If results from this research agenda indicate no absorption is observed, then concerns over adverse health effects from the dermal absorption of nanoparticles in sunscreens may be allayed. "
"BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) (or atopic eczema) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects children and adults and has an important impact on quality of life. Topical corticosteroids (TCS) are the first-line therapy for this condition; however, they can be associated with significant adverse effects when used chronically. Tacrolimus ointment (in its 2 manufactured strengths of 0.1% and 0.03%) might be an alternative treatment. Tacrolimus, together with pimecrolimus, are drugs called topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs). OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of topical tacrolimus for moderate and severe atopic dermatitis compared with other active treatments. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases up to 3 June 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library (Issue 5, 2015), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), and the Global Resource of Eczema Trials (GREAT database). We searched six trials registers and checked the bibliographies of included studies for further references to relevant trials. We contacted specialists in the field for unpublished data.A separate search for adverse effects of topical tacrolimus was undertaken in MEDLINE and EMBASE on 30 July 2013. We also scrutinised the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) websites for adverse effects information. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of participants with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (both children and adults) using topical tacrolimus at any dose, course duration, and follow-up time compared with other active treatments. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently screened and examined the full text of selected studies for compliance with eligibility criteria, risk of bias, and data extraction. Our three prespecified primary outcomes were physician's assessment, participant's self-assessment of improvement, and adverse effects. Our secondary outcomes included assessment of improvement of the disease by validated or objective measures, such as SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis), the EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index), and BSA (Body Surface Area) scores. MAIN RESULTS: We included 20 studies, with 5885 participants. The variability of drug doses, outcomes, and follow-up periods made it difficult to carry out meta-analyses.A single trial showed that tacrolimus 0.1% was better than low-potency TCS by the physician's assessment (risk ratio (RR) 3.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.14 to 4.45, 1 study, n = 371, moderate-quality evidence). It was also marginally better than low-potency TCS on face and neck areas and moderate-potency TCS on the trunk and extremities by the physician's assessment (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.49, 1 study, n = 972, moderate level of evidence) and for some of the secondary outcomes. Compared with pimecrolimus 1%, people treated with tacrolimus were almost twice as likely to improve by the physician's assessment (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.42, 2 studies, n = 506, moderate quality of evidence). Compared with the lower concentration of 0.03%, the tacrolimus 0.1% formulation reduced the risk of not having an improvement by 18% as evaluated by the physician's assessment (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.92, 6 studies, n = 1640, high-quality evidence). Tacrolimus 0.1% compared with moderate-to-potent TCS showed no difference by the physician's assessment, and 2 secondary outcomes (1 study, 377 participants) and a marginal benefit favouring tacrolimus 0.1% was found by the participant's assessment (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.29, 1 study, n = 974, low quality of evidence) and SCORAD.Based on data from 2 trials, tacrolimus 0.03% was superior to mild TCS for the physician's assessment (RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.96 to 3.38, 2 studies, n = 790, moderate-quality evidence) and the participant's self-assessment (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.90, 1 study, n = 416, moderate quality of evidence). One trial showed moderate benefit of tacrolimus 0.03% compared with pimecrolimus 1% on the physician's assessment (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.98, 1 study, n = 139, low-quality evidence), but the effects were equivocal when evaluating BSA. In the comparison of tacrolimus 0.03% with moderate-to-potent corticosteroids, no difference was found in most of the outcomes measured (including physician's and participant's assessment and also for the secondary outcomes), but in two studies, a marginal benefit favouring the corticosteroid group was found for the EASI and BSA scores.Burning was more frequent in those using calcineurin inhibitors than those using corticosteroid tacrolimus 0.03% (RR 2.48, 95% CI 1.96 to 3.14, 5 studies, 1883 participants, high-quality evidence), but no difference was found for skin infections. Symptoms observed were mild and transient. The comparison between the two calcineurin inhibitors (pimecrolimus and tacrolimus) showed the same overall incidence of adverse events, but with a small difference in the frequency of local effects.Serious adverse events were rare; occurred in both the tacrolimus and corticosteroid groups; and in most cases, were considered to be unrelated to the treatment. No cases of lymphoma were noted in the included studies nor in the non-comparative studies. Cases were only noted in spontaneous reports, cohorts, and case-control studies. Systemic absorption was rarely detectable, only in low levels, and this decreased with time. Exception is made for diseases with severe barrier defects, such as Netherton's syndrome, lamellar ichthyosis, and a few others, with case reports of a higher absorption. We evaluated clinical trials; case reports; and in vivo, in vitro, and animal studies; and didn't find any evidence that topical tacrolimus could cause skin atrophy. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Tacrolimus 0.1% was better than low-potency corticosteroids, pimecrolimus 1%, and tacrolimus 0.03%. Results were equivocal when comparing both dose formulations to moderate-to-potent corticosteroids. Tacrolimus 0.03% was superior to mild corticosteroids and pimecrolimus. Both tacrolimus formulations seemed to be safe, and no evidence was found to support the possible increased risk of malignancies or skin atrophy with their use. The reliability and strength of the evidence was limited by the lack of data; thus, findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. We did not evaluate costs. "
"BACKGROUND: Intranasal sprays are recommended as targeted therapy for allergic rhinitis (AR) by providing direct delivery of medication to the nasal mucosa, reducing the potential for systemic adverse effects, decreasing burden of disease, and improving quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To review currently available intranasal sprays indicated for maintenance therapy of AR in the United States: intranasal antihistamines (INAH); intranasal corticosteroids (INCS); and MP-AzeFlu, a single formulation nasal spray of the INAH, azelastine hydrochloride, and the INCS, fluticasone propionate. METHODS: MEDLINE searches were conducted to identify placebo-controlled studies of commercially available prescription nasal sprays at U.S.-approved doses and indications, and published after an earlier systematic review of AR treatment. Inclusion criteria were ≥20 subjects; duration of ≥2 weeks for seasonal (or episodic) AR, ≥4 weeks for perennial (or persistent) AR, and reporting a total nasal symptom score as a primary or secondary outcome. RESULTS: Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria: 4 pediatric, 16 adult/adolescent. There were 4 perennial AR studies (381 children, 1607 adults) and 16 seasonal AR trials (3081 children, 6548 adults). In these studies, 2451 subjects (481 children, 1970 adults) received an INCS, 3001 (1116 children, 1885 adults) received an INAH, and 346 adult subjects received MP-AzeFlu. All active treatments were well tolerated and effective as measured by the reduction in nasal symptoms. Head-to-head comparisons were only available for MP-AzeFlu versus the individual active agent components. MP-AzeFlu provided significantly greater symptom relief than either azelastine or fluticasone propionate alone and with an onset starting at 30 minutes after the dose. CONCLUSION: The most recent addition to intranasal sprays for the maintenance therapy of AR is MP-AzeFlu, a single formulation nasal spray of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate in an advanced delivery system. Analysis of clinical data showed this to be the first new intranasal medication that provides greater clinical benefit than an INCS in treating AR. "
"Abstract: The development and manufacture of novel nanocarriers for drug delivery has proved challenging with regards to scale-up and pharmaceutical quality. Polymeric nanocarriers composed of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-b-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLGA-PEG) were prepared and the photosensitizer meso-tetrakis(3-hydroxyphenyl) chlorin (mTHPC) was effectively encapsulated. Furthermore, the interplay of various process and formulation parameters and their impact on the most important product specifications were investigated by using a factorial design and a central composite design in a microfluidic manufacturing process. These nanoparticles for intravenous administration with a size of 97 ± 0.13 nm, narrow size distribution, and an encapsulation efficiency of more than 80% were produced at high throughput. In vitro stability and in vitro drug release testing were applied for quality control purposes. Finally, the toxicity of the photosensitizer was tested in vitro. The cytotoxicity was successfully reduced while the efficacy of the formulation was maintained. First observations using in vivo imaging suggest effective distribution of the nanocarrier system after injection into rodents. Thus, further in vivo testing of the beneficial effects of nanoencapsulation into the matrix system and its formulation will be considered for the delivery of mTHPC to tumor tissues during photodynamic therapy.

"OBJECTIVE: Acetyl aspartic acid (A-A-A) was proposed as a new novel active ingredient for use in cosmetics. The safety of A-A-A was assessed by following an in-house-developed 'New Ingredient Testing Strategy', which was designed in accordance with the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) notes of guidance and the requirements of Annex I of the EU Cosmetics Regulation. The aim of the project was to determine whether A-A-A was safe for use in cosmetics and to determine a maximum permitted safe level in the formulations. METHODS: A literature review was conducted, consulting over 40 different information sources. This highlighted a number of gaps which required testing data. A-A-A was tested for phototoxicity according to OECD test guideline 432, skin irritation according to OECD test guideline 439 and eye irritation according to OECD test guideline 437. Dermal absorption of A-A-A was measured according to OECD test guideline 428 and was used to calculate the margin of safety (MoS). Finally, A-A-A was tested in a human repeat insult patch test (HRIPT) and a 14-day in-use tolerance study. RESULTS: A-A-A was non-phototoxic and was non-irritating to skin and eyes in in vitro testing. Dermal absorption was calculated to be 5%. The MoS for A-A-A was 351, at a level of 5%, for all cosmetic product types, indicating no systemic safety toxicity concern. A-A-A at 5% under occlusive patch on a panel of 50 adult volunteers induced no skin irritation or allergic reaction in the HRIPT study. Finally, repeated application of A-A-A to the periocular area, twice per day for 14 days, in 21 female volunteers, demonstrated that 1% A-A-A was well tolerated following dermatological and ophthalmological assessment in a cosmetic formulation. CONCLUSION: A-A-A was assessed as safe by the cosmetic safety assessor for use in cosmetics at a level of 5% in all cosmetic product types, in line with the requirements of the EU Cosmetics Regulation and in accordance with the SCCS notes of guidance.

"BACKGROUND: Incomplete efficiency of oral medications restricts their therapeutic success in pain control of the painful form of the diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Use of topical medications because of less systemic side effects is more acceptable. This study aimed to compare the effect of clonidine gel and capsaicin cream in relieving pain associated with DPN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This 12-week, randomized, double-blind and parallel-group trial was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of topical clonidine and capsaicin. Totally, 139 patients with type 2 diabetes with a pain score of at least 4 as assessed by visual analog scale (VAS), were treated for up to 3 months. The endpoint of the study was the reduction in the median pain score from baseline, as assessed by the VAS at the 4 weekly follow-up visits. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat population for the efficacy analysis consists of 69 patients receiving clonidine and 70 patients receiving capsaicin. Both drugs significantly relieved pain at 12 weeks (P < 0.001 for both) but no significant difference in the efficacy between the two treatments was observed (P = 0.931). Dermatologic complications were more common in capsaicin group (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed the comparable efficacy of clonidine gel in comparison with capsaicin cream in the treatment of pain due to DPN with less adverse events. More studies are required to better evaluate the efficacy and safety of this topical compound for relieving pain in DPN. "
"OBJECTIVE: Biologic drugs, such as the anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) antibody adalimumab, have represented a breakthrough in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Yet, concerns remain over their lack of efficacy in a sizable proportion of patients and their potential for systemic side effects such as infection. Improved biologic prodrugs specifically targeted to the site of inflammation have the potential to alleviate current concerns surrounding biologic anticytokine therapies. The purpose of this study was to design, construct, and evaluate in vitro and ex vivo the targeting and antiinflammatory capacity of activatable bispecific antibodies. METHODS: Activatable dual variable domain (aDVD) antibodies were designed and constructed to target intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), which is up-regulated at sites of inflammation, and anti-TNF antibodies (adalimumab and infliximab). These bispecific molecules included an external arm that targets ICAM-1 and an internal arm that comprises the therapeutic domain of an anti-TNF antibody. Both arms were linked to matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-cleavable linkers. The constructs were tested for their ability to bind and neutralize both in vitro and ex vivo targets. RESULTS: Intact aDVD constructs demonstrated significantly reduced binding and anti-TNF activity in the prodrug formulation as compared to the parent antibodies. Human synovial fluid and physiologic concentrations of MMP enzyme were capable of cleaving the external domain of the antibody, revealing a fully active molecule. Activated antibodies retained the same binding and anti-TNF inhibitory capacities as the parent molecules. CONCLUSION: The design of a biologic prodrug with enhanced specificity for sites of inflammation (synovium) and reduced specificity for off-target TNF is described. This construct has the potential to form a platform technology that is capable of enhancing the therapeutic index of drugs for the treatment of RA and other inflammatory diseases. "
"BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris is one of the most common skin diseases treated by dermatologists. Salts of copper chlorophyllin complex are semi-synthetic naturally-derived compounds with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and wound healing activity that have not been previously tested topically in the treatment of acne-prone skin with enlarged pores. OBJECTIVES: This single-center pilot study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of a liposomal dispersion of topically applied sodium copper chlorophyllin complex in subjects with mild-moderate acne and large, visible pores over a course of 3 weeks. METHODS: Subjects were supplied with the test product, a topical gel containing a liposomal dispersion of sodium copper chlorophyllin complex (0.1%) with directions to apply a small amount to the facial area twice daily. Clinical assessments were performed at screening/baseline and at week 3. VISIA readings were taken and self-assessment questionnaires were conducted. RESULTS: 10 subjects were enrolled and completed the 3-week study. All clinical efficacy parameters showed statistically significant improvements over baseline at week 3. The study product was well tolerated. Subject questionnaires showed the test product was highly rated. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, a topical formulation containing a liposomal dispersion of sodium copper chlorophyllin complex was shown to be clinically effective and well tolerated for the treatment of mild-moderate acne and large, visible pores when used for 3 weeks. "
"BACKGROUND: Topical retinoids are first-line treatment options for acne vulgaris. These drugs, however, produce varying degree of cutaneous irritation within the first few weeks of treatment. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to examine differences in tolerability of topical retinoids and assess whether these differences would be clinically meaningful. METHODS: A PubMed search was performed for sources on topical retinoids in acne vulgaris treatment. Thirty-four clinical studies were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirteen studies had statistically significant results on tolerability of retinoid based on retinoid, vehicle, concentration, or skin type. All studies classified most of skin reactions as mild-moderate. Large differences in the number of dropouts due to irritation were not identified. CONCLUSION: Irritation studies did not show a high frequency of clinically significant irritation with topical retinoids. We anticipate that the large variation in patient use of topical retinoids would likely account for more variation in response than differences between drug formulations. "
"Abstract: The major influencing factors on persistent asthma control are the selected treatment(s), the drug delivery route and patient's adherence to therapy, together with the influence of lifestyle (i.e. sedentary habit), comorbid conditions and specific asthma phenotypes. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in combination with a long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) are the gold standard for management of persistent asthma, with maximal local targeting and minimal systemic side effects. Several innovative inhaler devices have been developed for effective local drug administration and good patient compliance to therapy. Recently, a new ICS/LABA fixed combination, formulated with fluticasone propionate (FP) and formoterol fumarate (FF), has been proposed for maintenance treatment of asthma in adults and adolescent patients. FP/FF combines the anti-inflammatory and bronchodilating properties of powerful compounds in a single inhaler. Its pharmacological characteristics allow rapid speed of onset and dosage flexibility required for step-up and step-down strategies, improving adherence to treatment of asthmatic patients. The efficacy of the FP/FF fixed combination at all dosages in controlling asthma symptoms and the reduced rate of discontinuation have been demonstrated by all randomized trials conducted so far. "
"Abstract: Biosimilars are not generic drugs. These are more complex medications than small molecules, with identical chemical structures of monoclonal antibodies that lost their patency over time. Besides identical to the original product at the end, the process of achieving its final forms differs from the one used in the reference products. These differences in the formulation process can alter final outcomes such as safety and efficacy of the drugs. Recently, a biosimilar of Infliximab was approved in some countries, even to the management of inflammatory bowel diseases. However, this decision was based on studies performed in rheumatologic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Extrapolation of the indications from rheumatologic conditions was done for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis based on these studies. In this article, the authors explain possible different mechanisms in the pathogenesis between rheumatologic conditions and inflammatory bowel diseases, that can lead to different actions of the medications in different diseases. The authors also alert the gastroenterological community for the problem of extrapolation of indications, and explain in full details the reasons for being care with the use of biosimilars in inflammatory bowel diseases without specific data from trials performed in this scenario.

"Abstract: The first biosimilar version of a biologic agent used to treat psoriasis (infliximab) entered the Spanish market on February 16 of this year, and more biosimilars can be expected to follow in the coming months and years. Logically, this new situation will have economic repercussions and alter prescribing patterns among dermatologists. In this article, we review regulatory issues related to the approval of biosimilars, with a particular focus on the situation in the European Union. We will examine analytical characterization studies and special considerations for clinical trials with biosimilars, and also look at several somewhat contentious issues, such as the extrapolation of indications, interchangeability, and automatic substitution. Finally, we will review the biosimilars with indications for psoriasis currently in the clinical development pipeline and assess their potential to offer comparable efficacy and safety to the reference product while contributing to the sustainability of the public health care system.

"Abstract: Unprotected sunlight exposure is a risk factor for a variety of cutaneous cancers. Topically used dihydroxyacetone (DHA) creates, via Maillard reaction, chemically fixed keratin sunscreen in the stratum corneum with significant protection against UVA/Soret radiation. When used in conjunction with naphthoquinones a naphthoquinone-modified DHA Maillard reaction is produced that provides protection across the UVB/UVA/Soret spectra lasting up to 1 week, resisting sweating and contact removal. The aim of this study was to examine a simplified version of this formulation for effect on UV transmission and to determine if penetration levels merit toxicity concerns. Permeability was demonstrated for freshly prepared DHA (30 mg/mL) and lawsone (0.035 mg/mL) alone and in combination using a side-by-side diffusion apparatus at 37°C over 48 h across shed snake skin and dermatomed pig skin. These samples were then examined for effectiveness and safety. Concentrations were determined by HPLC and UPLC monitored from 250-500 nm. Lawsone flux significantly decreased across pig skin (20.8 (± 4.8) and 0.09 (± 0.1) mg/cm(2) h without and with DHA, respectively) but did not change across shed snake skin in the presence of DHA. Significantly reduced lawsone concentration was noted in donor chambers of combined solutions. Damage was not observed in any skins. Darker coloration with greater UV absorbance was observed in skins exposed to the combined solution versus individual solutions. This study confirmed that combined DHA and lawsone provided effective blocking of ultraviolet light through products bound in keratinized tissue. DHA permeation levels in pig skin suggest further in vitro and in vivo study is required to determine the safety of this system. "
"BACKGROUND: Intrathecal morphine is commonly used for post caesarean analgesia. However, their use is frequently associated with the incidence of troublesome side effects such as nausea, vomiting and pruritus. Various mechanisms have been postulated for the opioid-induced pruritus, with a variety of medications with different mechanisms of actions formulated for the prevention and treatment. But, the results are inconsistent and hence the prevention and treatment of opioid-induced pruritus still remains a challenge. Ondansetron which is antiemetic, non-sedative and has no antianalgesic effect is an antagonist to 5-HT3 receptor, the receptor with which opioids interacts and imparts its effects. Ondansetron, thus, would be an attractive treatment strategy for both opioid-induced pruritus and post-operative nausea and vomiting. METHODS: After the approval from institutional review committee and written consent received from the patient, 50 healthy parturients of ASA I and II physical status undergoing caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia were enrolled for the study. They were randomly categorized into placebo group (2 ml normal saline) and treatment group (2 ml of 4 mg ondansetron), each group containing 25 patients. Pruritus and post-operative nausea and vomiting scores were recorded up to 24 hours after the administration of intrathecal morphine. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square test. RESULTS: The incidence, severity and necessity of treatment for pruritus in the treatment group was significantly reduced compared to the placebo group (16% vs 88%). Similarly, the risk of post-operative nausea and vomiting in the treatment group was less compared to the placebo group (8% vs 56%). CONCLUSION: Prophylactic administration of ondansetron to parturients receiving intrathecal morphine for post-operative analgesia provides a significant reduction of intrathecal morphine-induced pruritus and nausea and vomiting.

"Abstract: Neutral porphyrins for antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) have received little attention due to their tendency to aggregate in aqueous media and reports of low phototoxic effect. These compounds may be less toxic to cells than positively and negatively charged photosensitisers. The preparation of highly bacterial phototoxic formulations of neutral porphyrins remains an open field of research with great potential if achievable. The purpose of this study was to develop novel hydrophilic formulations of the neutral porphyrin 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-porphyrin (THPP) by use of natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) prepared by the solvent evaporation method. Physical and photochemical stability and in vitro photoinactivation of Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli were investigated. Two of the 15 NADES investigated demonstrated superior solubilising properties of THPP. The photostability of THPP was higher in NADES than in methanol. A 100-fold dilution of the preparations with buffer to a final concentration of 0.5-5 nM THPP resulted in complete photoinactivation of E. faecalis and E. coli both in their exponential and stationary phase. THPP demonstrated significantly higher phototoxicity when formulated in NADES than in other aqueous preparations like phosphate buffered saline. NADES as a formulation concept for photosensitisers shows a great potential in aPDT. "
"UNLABELLED: This study compared the effects of pediatric acne treatment with two isotretinoin formulations on bone mineral density. We demonstrated no difference in the effect of the two formulations. No effect on pediatric bone mineral density was identified for either formulation. INTRODUCTION: Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) is a treatment for recalcitrant nodular acne with a purported effect on bone mineral density (BMD). The side effects of isotretinoin on vertebral bone were evaluated to assess the safety of a new FDA-approved isotretinoin formulation: Lidose-isotretinoin (Cip-Iso). METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, phase III, active control, parallel-group, multicenter study compared the safety, efficacy, and non-inferiority of CIP-Iso to a marketed reference product, Accutane®, in severe recalcitrant nodular acne subjects. Three hundred fifty-eight pediatric male and female subjects aged between 12 and 17 years underwent 20 weeks of treatment with PA lumbar spine dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements obtained for bone mineral density (BMD) and Z-scores, 5.5 months apart on visits 1 and 8. One hundred sixty-eight of 358 subjects had height adjusted Z-scores (HAZ) calculated. RESULTS: There was no difference in the least squares (LS) mean Z-score or HAZ of the two drugs at visit 1 or 8. The mean and LS mean Z-score and HAZ were greater than zero at visits 1 and 8 for both drugs. The change in the LS mean spine Z-score, but not HAZ, between visits, was statistically significant for both drugs. There was a mean increase in BMD (g/cm(2)) for both products between visits. CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in the effect of two formulations of isotretinoin on spine bone density after 6 months of treatment. BMD increased and the small change in spine Z-score over treatment disappeared after height adjustment. Mean positive Z-scores and HAZ in the study were likely due to the exclusion of low and inclusion of high Z-score subjects. "
"Abstract: The prevalence of fungal infections of skin has increased rapidly, affecting approximately 40 million people across the globe. A wide variety of antifungal drugs has been utilized in the effective management of numerous dermatological infections. Topical treatment of fungal infections has proved to be quite advantageous due to various factors like targeting the site of infection, minimizing systemic side effects, enhanced efficacy of treatment, and improved patient compliance. In spite the fact that these agents are therapeutically active on topical application, these have restricted drug delivery across the skin resulting in insufficient therapeutic index and may exert local as well as systemic side effects. The accomplishment of topical drug delivery needs to pacify two anomalous aspects, first the barrier nature of stratum corneum, and second, deposition of drug within the skin should be ideally achieved with limited percutaneous absorption. Thus, to facilitate the delivery of antifungal drugs and improve the treatment aspects, various novel delivery carriers have been developed. This article attempts to provide an in-depth knowledge of nanoparticulate and vesicular carriers. This article focuses on the different aspects of fungal infections and their effective treatment with antifungal drugs. Efficacy of various carrier systems (nanoparticulate and vesicular carriers) in delivering antifungal drugs topically has also been discussed. Besides, compiling various research reports, this article also includes formulation considerations inclusive of regulatory aspects of excipients used, the mechanisms of penetration, and patents reported.

"PURPOSE: To evaluate epithelial signs and pain after epithelial-on corneal collagen cross-linking (Epi-on CCL) with new transepithelial riboflavin formulation and epithelial-off corneal collagen cross-linking (Epi-off CCL) with standard riboflavin formulation and to compare pain and duration of epithelial healing between both techniques. METHODS: Thirty-nine eyes of 39 patients undergoing Epi-on CCL and 39 eyes of 39 patients undergoing Epi-off CCL were evaluated. Corneal epithelial signs and durations of corneal epithelial healing and subjective pain scores after the procedures were recorded and compared between 2 groups. RESULTS: Total epithelialization was observed after 2.7 ± 0.7 days in Epi-on CCL and 2.3 ± 0.4 days in Epi-off CCL (P = 0.006). The mean pain score on the first day was 3.1 ± 0.6 in Epi-on CCL and 2.3 ± 0.4 in Epi-off CCL with a significant difference (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The epithelial damage was observed in both procedures; also, the epithelial healing time was longer in Epi-on CCL and it is of great importance that the patients should have therapeutic contact lenses until the epithelium heals in both procedures. The Epi-off CCL group had less pain scores than the Epi-on CCL group and more pain problems after Epi-on CCL still remains. The patient should be informed about pain, even if the Epi-on CCL procedure was performed. "
"Abstract: Acne vulgaris is the chronical, multifactorial and complex disease of the pilosebaceous unit in the skin. The main goal of the topical therapy in acne is to target the drug to epidermal and deep dermal regions by minimizing systemic absorption . Isotretinoin, a retinoic acid derivative, is the most effective drug in acne pathogenesis. Because systemic treatment may cause many side effects, topical isotretinoin treatment is an option in the management of acne. However, due to its high lipophilic character, isotretinoin tends to accumulate in the upper stratum corneum, thus its penetration into the lower layers is limited, which restricts the efficiency of topical treatment. Microemulsions are fluid, isotropic, colloidal drug carriers that have been widely studied as drug delivery systems. The percutaneous transport of active agents can be enhanced by microemulsions when compared with their conventional formulations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate microemulsions as alternative topical carriers for isotretinoin with an objective to improve its skin uptake. After in vitro permeation studies, the dermal penetration of isotretinoin from microemulsions was investigated by tape stripping procedure. Confocal laser scanning microscopy provided insight about the localization of the drug in the skin. The interaction between the microemulsion components and stratum corneum lipids is studied by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. The relative safety of the microemulsions was assessed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts using MTT viability test. The results indicate that microemulsion-based novel colloidal carriers have a potential for enhanced skin delivery and localization of isotretinoin. "
"Abstract: Ultraviolet (UV) light has the potential to cause many adverse effects on the body including causing the cancers melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The use of sunscreens to protect against these harmful effects has become common practice. However, many of the sunscreens currently being used have the ability to cross the skin barrier and enter the body. These components can produce reactive oxygen species inside the body which can cause damage to cells. We have developed a sunscreen product that contains organic particles that are too large to diffuse into the skin. These particles are formed from four FDA approved UV blocking molecules that are solids at room temperature. The components are first mixed together, melted, and then emulsified in water and allowed to cool. Once cooled, the particles slowly crystallize in the solution forming sphere to rod-like particles about one micron wide and one to tens of microns in length. SPF measurements of the samples showed comparable results to two commercially available sunscreens with SPFs of 50. The particles were shown to maintain their excellent UV blocking properties after exposure to UV light and show great promise as possible sunscreens. "
"BACKGROUND: Histoplasmosis may complicate tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α blocker therapy. Published case series provide limited guidance on disease management. We sought to determine the need for long-term antifungal therapy and the safety of resuming TNF-α blocker therapy after successful treatment of histoplasmosis. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective review of 98 patients diagnosed with histoplasmosis between January 2000 and June 2011. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate risk factors for severe disease. RESULTS: The most commonly used biologic agent was infliximab (67.3%). Concomitant corticosteroid use (odds ratio [OR], 3.94 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.06-14.60]) and higher urine Histoplasma antigen levels (OR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.03-1.25]) were found to be independent predictors of severe disease. Forty-six (47.4%) patients were initially treated with an amphotericin B formulation for a median duration of 2 weeks. Azole treatment was given for a median of 12 months. TNF-α blocker therapy was initially discontinued in 95 of 98 (96.9%) patients and later resumed in 25 of 74 (33.8%) patients at a median of 12 months (range, 1-69 months). The recurrence rate was 3.2% at a median follow-up period of 32 months. Of the 3 patients with recurrence, 2 had restarted TNF-α blocker therapy, 1 of whom died. Mortality rate was 3.2%. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, disease outcomes were generally favorable. Discontinuation of antifungal treatment after clinical response and an appropriate duration of therapy, probably at least 12 months, appears safe if pharmacologic immunosuppression has been held. Resumption of TNF-α blocker therapy also appears safe, assuming that the initial antifungal therapy was administered for 12 months. "
"AIM: Moderate and chronic paronychia is a common disease affecting the hand. Treatment can be effective but the affection is often recurrent, especially as an occupational disease. Moreover, this condition may be complicated by a Candida spp or by bacterial infections. Therefore, general preventive measures can be useful in maintaining health. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of a new combination of topical medications in the treatment and prevention of moderate and chronic paronychia. This formulation includes an insulating polymer (Syn-cell barrier), two topical antifungals (octopirox and climbazole) and a molecule with anti-inflammatory activity (corticoid-like repair). METHODS: Thirty adult subjects (age, 16-78 years; 24 females and 6 males) affected by moderate or chronic paronychia, with or without nail alterations, were evaluated. Included in the study were patients with allergic contact dermatitis (8), irritant contact dermatitis (19), psoriatic paronychia (2 patients), lichen planus of the nails (1 patient). Sometimes Candida spp or bacteria overlapped with paronychia (16 patients positive for Candida spp and 4 patients with bacterial paronychia), sometimes infectious paronychia was not associated with dermatitis of the hands. All 30 subjects were treated with a new cream formulation, three applications per day for 2 months. In 8 patients with proven and severe candidiasis of the nails, oral fluconazole 100 mg was added for 20 days. All patients with bacterial perionyxis took clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for six days. Patients were then followed for 8 weeks. RESULTS: After two months of treatment, 26 patients responded to therapy. In particular, the treatment evaluation at the end of the follow-up period showed a clinical cure in 46.6% (14 patients), improvement in 40% (12 patients), and failure in 13.4% (4 patients). There was a side effect (moderate skin irritation) in 2 patients, but the drug was not discontinued. CONCLUSION: Results of the present study, based on its safety, effectiveness and innovative features, indicate that this combination of topical cream may be considered as a new alternative for treatment and prevention of paronychia, especially in case of occupational hand disease where prolonged treatment and continuous prevention are needed.

"CONTEXT: Capsaicin (CAP) is an effective drug in the treatment of pain and cancer. However, its practical administration has been limited due to poor aqueous solubility and bioavailability, as well as strong gastrointestinal irritation. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to improve the solubility and oral bioavailability of CAP by reducing irritation via hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) inclusion complex formulation, in vitro and in vivo analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The complex (CAP-HP-β-CD) was developed via the magnetic stirring method and characterized using ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectrometry, infrared radiation (IR) spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Rats were treated with CAP (90 mg × kg(-1)) or CAP-HP-β-CD (corresponding to 90 mg × kg(-1) CAP) by gavage, and all the plasma samples were analyzed with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: The results of UV, IR, and DSC showed that an acceptable CAP-HP-β-CD (encapsulation efficiency, 75.83%; drug loading, 7.44%) was formulated. In vitro release study of CAP-HP-β-CD revealed that the cumulative release of CAP from HP-β-CD encapsulation was obviously enhanced (above 80% increases). Similarly, the in vivo pharmacokinetics parameters also increased, Cmax (from 737.94 to 1117.57 ng × mL(-1)), AUC0- (from 5285.9 to 7409.8 ng × h × mL(-1)) or relative bioavailability (139.38%). The gastric irritation bioassay further showed that the CAP-HP-β-CD was far better than free CAP. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: CAP exhibited significant aqueous solubility and oral bioavailability, as well as minimal irritation effect after forming inclusion complex with HP-β-CD. Therefore, these findings could provide an equally important alternative option for the clinical use of CAP. "
"PURPOSE: Interferon injectables and glatiramer acetate have served as the primary disease-modifying treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS) since their introduction in the 1990s and are first-line treatments for relapsing-remitting forms of MS (RRMS). Many new drug therapies were launched since early 2010, expanding the drug treatment options considerably in a disease state that once had a limited treatment portfolio. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the safety profile and efficacy data of disease-modifying agents for MS approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from 2010 to the present and provide cost and available pharmacoeconomic data about each new treatment. METHODS: Peer-reviewed clinical trials, pharmacoeconomic studies, and relevant pharmacokinetic/pharmacologic studies were identified from MEDLINE (January 2000-December 2014) by using the search terms multiple sclerosis, fingolimod, teriflunomide, alemtuzumab, dimethyl fumarate, pegylated interferon, peginterferon beta-1a, glatiramer 3 times weekly, and pharmacoeconomics. Citations from available articles were also reviewed for additional references. The databases publically available at www.clinicaltrials.gov and www.fda.gov were searched for unpublished studies or studies currently in progress. FINDINGS: A total of 5 new agents and 1 new dosage formulation were approved by the FDA for the treatment of RRMS since 2010. Peginterferon beta-1a and high-dose glatiramer acetate represent 2 new effective injectable options for MS that reduce burden of administration seen with traditional interferon and low-dose glatiramer acetate. Fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate represent new oral agents available for MS, and their efficacy in reducing annualized relapse rates is 48% to 55%, 22% to 36.3%, and 44% to 53%, respectively, compared with placebo. Alemtuzumab is a biologic given over a 2-year span that reduced annualized relapse rates by 55% in treatment-naive patients and by 49% in patients relapsing on prior disease-modifying agents. Treatment emergent adverse effects were common with all new drug treatments. The cost of treating MS remains high, because MS therapies accounted for the highest spending growth of any specialty drug class in 2013. Most therapies cost, on average, US $6000/mo based on wholesale acquisition cost, and few cost-benefit studies are available for new treatments. IMPLICATIONS: With expansion of new treatments, patients and providers now have multiple options and improved flexibility in managing MS. The relative place in therapy of new treatments is unknown, and treatment decisions are largely based on patient preference, efficacy, and risk potential. The cost of treating MS continues to be high, even with more treatment options available. "
"BACKGROUND: Chronic exposure to the sun causes the skin to prematurely age. Photodamaged skin is characterized by progressive damage to the dermal extracellular matrix with loss of collagen and degradation of elastin. Clinical manifestations of such photoaged or photodamaged skin include wrinkles and irregular pigmentation. Various cosmetic treatments including topical retinoids, growth factors, and skin lighteners have shown some benefit. Salts of copper chlorophyllin complex are semi-synthetic naturally derived compounds with anti-oxidant and wound healing activity that has not been previously tested in photodamaged skin. OBJECTIVES: This single-center pilot study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of a liposomal dispersion of topically applied sodium copper chlorophyllin complex in women with mild-moderate fine lines and wrinkles in the periocular areas and facial solar lentigenes over a course of 8 weeks. METHODS: Subjects were supplied with the test product, a topical gel containing chlorophyllin complex salts (0.066%), with directions to apply a pea-sized amount to the periocular areas, cheeks and nose every morning and evening. Clinical assessments were performed at screening/baseline and at week 8. Standardized digital photographs were taken and self-assessment questionnaires were conducted. RESULTS: Ten subjects completed the 8-week study. All clinical efficacy parameters showed statistically significant improvements over baseline at week 8. The study product was well tolerated. Subject questionnaires showed the test product was highly rated. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, a topical formulation containing a liposomal dispersion of sodium copper chlorophyllin complex was shown to be clinically effective and well tolerated for the treatment of mild-moderate photodamage and solar lentigenes when used for 8 weeks.

"Abstract: Facial dyspigmentation treatment is an unmet need in dermatology with increasing challenges due to the questionable safety of hydroquinone. This research examined a new OTC formulation containing hydroxyphenoxy propionic acid, ellagic acid, yeast extract, and salicylic acid on subjects who previously completed 12 weeks of treatment with 4% hydroquinone and 0.025% retinoic acid. The goal of this study was to evaluate the skin lightening and tolerability profile of a 20-week maintanence therapy with a cosmeceutical formulation during the summer months. 33 healthy subjects ages 25-60 years with moderate facial dyspigmentation defined as a score of 3 on a 5-point scale were enrolled. There was statistically significant improvement at week 20 in terms of even skin tone (P<0.001), spot intensity (P<0.001), spot size (P<0.05) and overall hyperpigmentation (P>=0.002). "
"Abstract: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is one of the commonest malignancies occurred on sun-exposed skin, mainly by UV-B radiation, of lighter-skinned individuals. The aim of the present study was to develop advanced drug delivery formulations used in BCC therapy that overcomes chemotherapy-induced side-effects of skin photosensitivity by an integrative approach of nanoencapsulation in conjunction with combination therapy that uses chemotherapeutic, chemoprotective and sunscreen agents. The combination of anticancer drug together with sunscreen agent is very useful in therapy, especially for individuals who are more exposed to the sun without using a sunscreen. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) employed as drug delivery systems were co-loaded with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a hydrophilic chemotherapeutic drug, and ethylhexyl salicylate (EHS), a lipophilic UV-B sunscreen agent. The NLCs were developed using bioactive squalene (50.8% w/w) from amaranth seed oil as chemoprotective agent. By varying the concentrations of 5-FU and EHS, the co-loaded NLCs presented particle sizes of about 100nm, acceptable physical stability with values smaller than -25mV and appropriate entrapment efficiency that reaches values over 65% for both types of drugs. The UV-B blocking ability of EHS loaded into NLCs were influenced by the concentration of 5-FU. The amaranth oil offered a capacity of 70% in scavenging the free radicals. In vitro drug release showed that NLCs presented sustained release of 5-FU that followed the Fick's law of diffusion. "
"OBJECTIVE: Promethazine abuse has been reported. The objective was to investigate promethazine abuse/misuse in the United States. METHODS: An 11-year retrospective review was conducted of promethazine abuse and intentional misuse cases without co-ingestants in persons 10 years and older reported to the National Poison Data System. Data were stratified by product (promethazine-alone [PA] or co-formulation [PC]) and evaluated for demographics, toxicity, management sites, and outcomes. RESULTS: There were 354 single product abuse or misuse exposures-95 PA and 259 PC. Over the 11-year timeframe, the annual exposure rate per 100,000 population doubled. Exposures were most prevalent among 10 to 19 years old and young adults (20s), accounting for 69.5% of PA and 57.5% of PC cases. Clinical effects due to PA included drowsiness (43.2%), tachycardia (7.4%), agitation (13.7%), confusion (13.7%), slurred speech (12.6%), hallucinations (7.4%), dizziness (7.4%), and hypertension (5.3%). Drowsiness (53.4%) and tachycardia (20.8%) were more frequent with PC. There were significant differences between PA and PC in management site (P = 0.0078). Management sites for PA and PC, respectively, were emergency department (37.9%, 55.6%), non-health care facility (33.7%, 14.7%), critical care unit (8.4%, 11.2%), non-critical care unit (7.4%, 7.3%), psychiatry (2.1%, 4.2%), and other/unknown (10.5%, 7.0%). Outcomes for PA and PC, respectively, were no effect (21.0%, 12.4%), minor (58.9%, 53.7%), moderate (17.9%, 32.0%), and major effects (2.1%, 1.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Promethazine-alone abuse/misuse most frequently resulted in minor outcomes, and less than 20% required medical admission. Abuse/misuse of PC resulted in a higher frequency of health care facility treatment and a trend toward more moderate outcomes. These differences are most likely attributed to the co-formulate. "
"Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health concern, and new therapies are needed to overcome the problems associated with dosing frequency, patient compliance, and drug resistance. To reduce side effects associated with systemic drug distribution and improve drug concentration at the target site, stable therapeutic nanocarriers (NCs) were prepared and evaluated for efficacy in vitro in Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected macrophages. Rifampicin (RIF), a current, broad-spectrum antibiotic used in TB therapy, was conjugated by degradable ester bonds to form hydrophobic prodrugs. NCs encapsulating various ratios of nonconjugated RIF and the prodrugs showed the potential ability to rapidly deliver and knockdown intracellular M. tuberculosis by nonconjugated RIF and to obtain sustained release of RIF by hydrolysis of the RIF prodrug. NCs of the novel antibiotic SQ641 and a combination NC with cyclosporine A were formed by flash nanoprecipitation. Delivery of SQ641 in NC form resulted in significantly improved activity compared to that of the free drug against intracellular M. tuberculosis. A NC formulation with a three-compound combination of SQ641, cyclosporine A, and vitamin E inhibited intracellular replication of M. tuberculosis significantly better than SQ641 alone or isoniazid, a current first-line anti-TB drug.

"UNLABELLED: Topical treatments have gained popularity for general use as an adjunct to systemic drugs in neuropathic pain, but their use produces variable clinical results and local adverse events. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and analgesic effect of a formulation of liposomal capsaicin (LC) (0.025%) in patients with post herpetic neuralgia (PHN). METHOD: Patients who remained symptomatic after first-and second-line treatment were randomized to receive LC for six weeks in a placebo-controlled, crossover design study. Clinical assessment was performed at baseline, in the second, fourth and sixth week of treatment. RESULTS: Thirteen patients completed both treatment periods. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was significantly decreased after the end of the study (p = 0.008), however the effect of treatment was not significant (p = 0.076). There was no difference on global impression of change and other pain characteristics. LC was safe and well tolerated. However, at the concentration used, its analgesic effects were marginal and not significant. "
"Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been successfully implemented as a treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), but very few photosensitizers have been developed for clinical use. Herein, we describe a novel formulation of liposomal hypocrellin B (LHB) that was prepared by high-pressure homogenization. The encapsulation efficiency and PDT efficacy in vitro of this new preparation were found to remain nearly constant over 1 year. Moreover, LHB is rapidly cleared from the blood, with a half-life of 2.319 ± 0.462 h and a very low serum concentration at 24 h after injection. Testing in a rat model of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) showed that leakage of blood vessels in CNV lesions was significantly reduced when LHB PDT was given at a dose of 1 mg kg(-1) along with yellow laser irradiation; the damage to the collateral retina and the retinal pigment epithelium was minimal. Skin phototoxicity assays showed that only two of the 200 mice given a 4 mg per kg dose of LHB experienced an inflammatory reaction in the auricle irradiated at 24 h after dosing. These data collectively indicate that LHB may be a safe and effective photosensitizer for vascular-targeted PDT of AMD. "
"Abstract: Aiming to develop biological skin dresses with improved performance in the treatment of skin wounds, acellular collagen I scaffolds were modified with polymeric microparticles and the subsequent loading of a hydroglycolic extract of Calendula officinalis flowers. Microparticles made of gelatin-collagen were produced by a water-in-oil emulsion/cross-linking method. Thereafter, these microparticles were mixed with collagen suspensions at three increasing concentrations and the resulting mixtures lyophilized to make microparticle-loaded porous collagen scaffolds. Resistance to enzymatic degradation, ability to associate with the C. officinalis extract, and the extract release profile of the three gelatin-collagen microparticle-scaffold prototypes were assessed in vitro and compared to collagen scaffolds without microparticles used as control. Data indicated that the incorporation of gelatin-collagen microparticles increased the resistance of the scaffolds to in vitro enzymatic degradation, as well as their association with the C. officinalis flower extract. In addition, a sharp decrease in cytotoxicity, as well as more prolonged release of the extract, was attained. Overall results support the potential of these systems to develop innovative dermal substitutes with improved features. Furthermore, the gelatin-collagen mixture represents a low-cost and scalable alternative with high clinical transferability, especially appealing in developing countries. "
"CONTEXT: Our group previously reported the photoinstability of some desonide topical commercial formulations under direct exposure to UVA radiation. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to prepare and characterize a gel-cream containing desonide, with greater photostability than the commercial gel-cream (C-GC). Benzophenone-3 (BP-3) was used as a photostabilizing agent. METHODS: The gel-cream developed (D-GC) containing BP-3 at 0.1% was prepared and characterized regarding its pH, drug content, spreadability, viscosity, in vitro drug release and in vitro permeation. The in vivo anti-inflammatory effect was assessed by ear edema measurement, croton oil-induced acute skin inflammation and myeloperoxidase assay. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: D-GC presented characteristics compatible with topical application, appropriate drug content and good spreadability, and non-Newtonian behavior with pseudoplastic flow. D-GC showed a good photostability profile, presenting a desonide content of 95.70% after 48 h of exposure to UVA radiation, and stability under room conditions during 60 days. The amount of desonide released from D-GC and C-GC was 57.8 and 51.7 µg/cm CONCLUSION: D-GC represents a promising approach to treat dermatological disorders, since it presented satisfactory physicochemical characteristics, the same biological activity as C-GC and superior photostability, conferred by the addition of BP-3 at 0.1%. "
"Abstract: Psoriasis, a skin disorder characterized by impaired epidermal differentiation, is regularly treated by systemic methotrexate (MTX), an effective cytotoxic drug but with numerous side effects. The aim of this work was to design topical MTX loaded niosomes for management of psoriasis to avoid systemic toxicity. To achieve this goal, MTX niosomes were prepared by thin film hydration technique. A Box-Behnken (BB) design, using Design-Expert(®) software, was employed to statistically optimize formulation variables. Three independent variables were evaluated: MTX concentration in hydration medium (X1), total weight of niosomal components (X2) and surfactant: cholesterol ratio (X3). The encapsulation efficiency percent (Y1: EE%) and particle size (Y2: PS) were selected as dependent variables. The optimal formulation (F12) displayed spherical morphology under transmission electron microscopy (TEM), optimum particle size of 1375.00 nm and high EE% of 78.66%. In-vivo skin deposition study showed that the highest value of percentage drug deposited (22.45%) and AUC0-10 (1.15 mg.h/cm(2)) of MTX from niosomes were significantly greater than that of drug solution (13.87% and 0.49 mg.h/cm(2), respectively). Moreover, in-vivo histopathological studies confirmed safety of topically applied niosomes. Concisely, the results showed that targeted MTX delivery might be achieved using topically applied niosomes for enhanced treatment of psoriasis. "
"Abstract: The goal of this study was to develop a parenteral microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine A (CyA). The CyA solubility in caprylic capric triglyceride (GTCC), ethyl oleate and soybean oil were determined. The pseudo-ternary diagrams of oil (GTCC), surfactant (Solutol® HS-15), cosurfactants (ethanol/polyethylene glycol 400 [PEG 400] mixture) and water were constructed to identify boundaries for microemulsion existence. The CyA was added at 3, 6 and 9% w/w to the optimal microemulsion composition. Microemulsion particle size, solution viscosity and conductivity were examined. The microemulsion stability and haemolytic potential were examined after dilution in 5% dextrose solution for injection to 1 mg/mL CyA. Microemulsion stability was examined after a three-month storage at 4 and 25 °C. The GTCC was selected as an oil phase for CyA microemulsion based on solubility results. The optimum CyA microemulsion formulation consisted of 2.5% CyA, 9% GTCC, 24% Solutol® HS 15, 8% PEG 400, 4% ethanol and 52.5% water based on weight percent. The average particle sizes of the optimized blank and drug-loaded microemulsions were 68.7 nm and 71.6 nm, respectively and remained unchanged upon 25-fold dextrose dilution. The results of microemulsion physical and CyA chemical were confirmed by a three-month stability study at 4 and 25 °C. In vitro haemolysis studies indicated that CyA microemulsions were well tolerated by erythrocytes. The novel microemulsion formulation of CyA was developed that is suitable for parenteral administration. This new formulation could potentially have less vehicle-associated side effects that current commercial formulation of CyA based on Cremophor® EL and ethanol solution. "
"BACKGROUND: There is a lack of information on the use oral immunosuppressive drugs in atopic dermatitis (AD) daily practice. OBJECTIVE: A 10-years overview of the use of oral immunosuppressive drugs in patients with severe AD. METHODS: Medical charts of patients with AD, who received oral immunosuppressive drugs at the Academic Medical Center Amsterdam and in the University Medical Center Utrecht between January 2001 and January 2011, were analysed. Particular attention was paid to patient characteristics, prior treatment, prescribed oral immunosuppressive drugs, the order of use, doses and treatment durations and reasons for discontinuation of treatment. RESULTS: Of 334 patients [53% male, mean age at start of an oral immunosuppressive drug 36.9 years (SD 13.6)] with AD received oral immunosuppressive treatment of which 102 (31%) participated in clinical trials. Cyclosporine A (CyA) was given in 80% of the patients, mycophenolate mofetil or enteric-coated mycophenolate (MMF/EC-MPS) in 31%, azathioprine (AZA) in 14%, methotrexate (MTX) in 11%, systemic glucocorticosteroids in 7% and systemic tacrolimus in 5%. In these academic centra, CyA was the first choice oral immunosuppressive in 252 patients. Reasons for discontinuation of oral immunosuppressive drugs were controlled AD disease, ineffectiveness and adverse events. CONCLUSION: Various types of oral immunosuppressive drugs have been used over the past 10 years for the treatment of severe AD with a prominent first choice for CyA. Adverse events and ineffectiveness were frequent reasons for discontinuation. A prospective database of patients using oral immunosuppressive treatments in daily practice will give more insight in the effectiveness and safety and may help to formulate future recommendations.

"Abstract: A newly developed slow-release tablet formulation of metamizole was compared with carprofen for post-operative analgesia in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Twenty-three dogs were randomly assigned to one of two groups, and administered 50 mg/kg metamizole PO (Group M) or 4 mg/kg carprofen PO (Group C) 1 h before anaesthetic induction and 24 and 48 h later. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with isoflurane and fentanyl, after premedication with 0.005 mg/kg medetomidine and 0.3 mg/kg methadone IM. A blinded observer assessed post-operative sedation, and analgesia using a visual analogue scale, a dynamic interactive visual analogue scale, the Glasgow composite pain scale (GCPS), and a mechanical nociceptive threshold device (T = 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 21, 24, 36, 45, 60 and 70 h after surgery). Rescue methadone was administered if the GCPS was >6/24 in ambulatory dogs, or >5/20 in non-ambulatory dogs. Plasma concentrations of test drugs were quantified. The dose range for metamizole was 39-56 mg/kg. At T = 0.5 h sedation scores were significantly higher in Group C and GCPS scores were significantly higher in Group M. Three dogs required rescue methadone (Group M, n = 1; Group C, n = 2). Vomiting occurred post-operatively in 45% of dogs in Group M. Carprofen and metamizole were both well absorbed; peak concentrations occurred within 4-24 h, and 4-16 h for carprofen and metamizole, respectively. Both drugs provided adequate analgesia of similar duration. No side effects were observed with carprofen while vomiting was frequent following administration of metamizole. "
"Abstract: Cutaneous permeation is a critical parameter when topical application of sunscreens containing antioxidants is considered. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cutaneous penetration of most marketed UV-filters combined with trans-resveratrol (RES) and beta-carotene (BTC) since few studies report skin penetration when such compounds are applied. Formulations containing octocrylene, octyl methoxycinnamate, avobenzone and bemotrizinole were prepared and supplemented or not with BTC, or with RES, or with both compounds in combination. Penetration studies were performed using Franz vertical diffusion cells and porcine ear skin as the biological membrane. The quantification of UV-filters and antioxidants in the stratum corneum (SC), viable epidermis plus dermis and receptor fluid was performed by HPLC. Results suggested that UV-filters and antioxidants did not permeate the skin but were retained for 12h post application. About 90% and 80%, respectively, of the total penetrated amount of UV-filters and antioxidants was found in the SC. Interestingly, it was observed that BTC, alone or combined with RES, reduced the skin retention of UV-filters on average by 63%. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the combination of antioxidants and UV-filters in sunscreens is advantageous for cutaneous penetration, since BTC and BTC+RES improved sunscreen safety by reducing delivery of the four UV-filters in the study into SC and viable epidermis. "
"Abstract: In terms of ocular drug delivery, biodegradable implant systems have several advantages including the ability to provide constant drug concentration at the target site, no necessity for surgical removal, and minimum systemic side effects. Cyclosporin A (CsA) is a neutral, hydrophobic, cyclic peptide of amino acids that frequently used for dry eye disease treatment. The aim of this study was to develop a nanoparticle-loaded implant system for sustained-release CsA delivery following subconjunctival implantation. Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (85:15) or poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) were used to prepare two different nanoparticle formulations. These nanoparticles loaded into PCL or poly(lactide-co-caprolactone) implant formulations were prepared by two different methods, which were molding and electrospinning. Size and zeta potential of nanoparticles were determined and the morphology of the formulations were investigated by scanning electron microscopy. CsA-loading efficiencies were calculated and the in vitro degradation and in vitro release studies were performed. MTT test was also performed using L929 fibroblast cells to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the formulations. PCL-PCL-NP-I formulation was implanted to Swiss Albino mice with induced dry eye syndrome to evaluate the efficacy. In vitro release studies showed that the release from the formulations continues between 30 and 60 days, and the cell viability was found to be 77.4%-99.0%. In vivo studies showed that healing is significantly faster in the presence of the selected implant formulation. Results indicated that nanodecorated implants are promising ocular carriers for controlled-release CsA application. "
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The antipsoriatic effect of an innovative aerosol foam formulation of fixed combination calcipotriol 50 μg/g (as hydrate; Cal) and betamethasone 0.5 mg/g (as dipropionate; BD) was explored in order to compare the effect with that of the first-line treatment Cal/BD ointment. METHODS: This was a Phase IIa, single-centre, investigator-blinded, exploratory study, with intra-individual comparison using a modified psoriasis plaque test. Patients were treated once daily (6 days/week) for 4 weeks with Cal/BD foam, Cal/BD ointment, BD foam and Cal/BD foam vehicle, randomized to four plaque test sites (5 cm(2) each). The primary efficacy endpoint was change in total clinical score (TCS; sum of erythema, scaling and lesional thickness). Secondary endpoints included ultrasonographic changes in total skin thickness and echo-poor band thickness, and adverse events. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients, median age 52.5 years (range 21-75), completed this study. At week 4, test sites treated with Cal/BD foam had a significantly greater decrease in mean (±SD) TCS (-6.00 ± 1.27) versus those treated with Cal/BD ointment (-5.25 ± 1.78; difference -0.75; 95 % CI -1.46 to -0.04; p = 0.038), BD foam (-4.96 ± 1.85; difference -1.04; 95 % CI -1.75 to -0.33; p = 0.005) or foam vehicle (-1.88 ± 1.12; difference -4.13; 95 % CI -4.83 to -3.42; p < 0.001). Total skin thickness and echo-poor band thickness of Cal/BD foam-treated sites were reduced to a greater extent than those treated with comparators. Eleven patients reported 17 adverse events, the most frequent being headache (five patients). There were no lesional/perilesional adverse events or adverse drug-related events. CONCLUSIONS: Cal/BD foam demonstrated a significant improvement in antipsoriatic effect over Cal/BD ointment, BD foam and foam vehicle alone. "
"BACKGROUND: Currently available over-the-counter cough remedies historically have been criticized for lack of scientific evidence supporting their efficacy. Although the first-generation antihistamine diphenhydramine is classified as an antitussive by the United States Food and Drug Administration, to the authors' knowledge it has never been shown to inhibit cough reflex sensitivity in subjects with pathological cough. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of diphenhydramine on cough reflex sensitivity. SETTING: Montefiore Medical Center, an academic medical center in New York City. METHODS: Twenty two subjects with acute viral upper respiratory tract infection (common cold) underwent cough reflex sensitivity measurement employing capsaicin challenge on 3 separate days, 2 h after ingesting single doses of study drug (to coincide with peak blood concentrations), administered in randomized, double-blind manner: a multicomponent syrup containing diphenhydramine (25 mg), phenylephrine (10 mg), in a natural cocoa formulation; dextromethorphan (30 mg) syrup; and, placebo syrup. The standard endpoint of cough challenge was used: concentration of capsaicin inducing ≥5 coughs (C5). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Effect on cough reflex sensitivity (C5). RESULTS: A significant difference (p = 0.0024) was established among groups, with pairwise analysis revealing a significant increase in mean log C5 (0.4 ± 0.55 (SD); p < 0.01) for the diphenhydramine-containing medication versus placebo, but not for dextromethorphan versus placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide the initial evidence of the ability of diphenhydramine to inhibit cough reflex sensitivity in subjects with acute pathological cough. Timing of cough reflex sensitivity measurement may not have allowed demonstration of maximal antitussive effect of dextromethorphan. "
"OBJECTIVE: Skin irritation in personal cleansing has been correlated with surfactant binding with stratum corneum proteins. Polar and non-polar oils are increasingly being used in cleansing formulations which contain high (10-15%) level of anionic and non-ionic surfactants. However, the effects of oils in modulating skin damage from a cleansing product have not been studied in any detail. The objectives of this study are to determine whether low-viscosity polar and non-polar oils differ in their ability to reduce surfactant-induced skin irritation and, if so, how it might be related to their interactions with proteins. METHODS: Surfactant-induced skin irritation was measured by a 14-day in vivo cumulative patch irritation test. The methodology was similar to the well-known soap chamber test. Surfactant interactions with the water-soluble protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), in the presence of oils were measured by conductometric titration. The effects of low-viscosity polar and non-polar oils on stratum corneum protein dynamics in the sulfhydryl group region were studied by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) using the covalently bound spin-label 3-maleimido-proxyl (5-MSL). EPR measurements were performed with stratum corneums obtained from discarded skins of 3- to 4-week-old female pigs. Simulation of the complex spectra provided insights on the environment and mobility of the protein-bound spin label. RESULTS: Addition of 1% polar sunflower seed oil (viscosity 42 centipoise) reduced in vivo irritation of 1% sodium lauryl ether sulphate with two ethoxylate/cocamidopropyl betaine (SLES/CAPB) by 20%, whereas 1% non-polar mineral oil (viscosity 15 centipoise) had no effect. Polar oil glyceryl trioleate (a major component in sunflower seed oil) at 10% level reduced surfactant binding to BSA protein in water by 40%, whereas the non-polar oil dodecane (a major component of mineral oil) at a similar level did not have any effect. The mobility of the spin label in a dry corneum was very low and was increased significantly with the addition of water and glycerol trioleate but less so with mineral oil. CONCLUSION: Sunflower seed oil reduces surfactant-induced in vivo skin irritation more than mineral oil. This is possibly due to stronger interaction of polar oil with proteins, thus protecting it from surfactant binding. "
"Abstract: By the virtue of their nature, cosmetic products are used to clean, perfume, change the appearance of the human body's various external parts and maintain them in a good condition. Their main sites of action may be exemplified by the nails, the hair system, the epidermis, the external genital organs and the mucous membranes of the oral cavity. Sunscreen preparations consist of organic chemicals and inorganic materials. Inorganic materials include chemicals that scatter UV light physically like TiO2 and ZnO. Organic materials such as avobenzone reduce the amount of UV light to which the human skin is exposed by absorbing the radiation and subsequent disposal in different ways. One of the way of disposal may be by undergoing photoinduced decompositions which not only cause a reduction of the sunscreen UV-protective capacity during usage but may precipitate allergic or toxic degradates. Thus undoubtedly a high photostability is an important requirement for the effectiveness of sunscreen products. Many researchers patented their work on this aspect of protection of avobenzone from photodegradation using varying methodologies. This review article discusses some of the patented works done in enhancing the photostability of avobenzone and its formulations. "
"Abstract: Biodegradable nanoparticles are being considered more often as drug carriers to address pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic issues, yet nano-product safety has not been systematically proven. In this study, haematological, biochemical and histological parameters were examined on 28 day daily dosing of rats with nano- or micro-particle encapsulated cyclosporine (CsA) to confirm if any changes observed were drug or carrier dependent. CsA encapsulated poly(lactide-co-glycolide) [PLGA] nano- (nCsA) and micro-particles (mCsA) were prepared by emulsion techniques. CsA (15, 30, 45 mg/kg) were administered by oral gavage to Sprague Dawley (SD) rats over 28 days. Haematological and biochemical metrics were followed with tissue histology performed on sacrifice. Whether presented as nCsA or mCsA, 45 mg/kg dose caused significant loss of body weight and lowered food consumption compared to untreated control. Across the doses, both nCsA and mCsA produce significant decreases in lymphocyte numbers compared to controls, commensurate with the proprietary product, Neoral(®) 15. Dosing with nCsA showed higher serum drug levels than mCsA presumably owing to the smaller particle size facilitating absorption. The treatment had no noticeable effects on inflammatory/oxidative stress markers or antioxidant enzyme levels, except an increase in ceruloplasmin (CP) levels for high dose nCsA/mCsA group. Further, only subtle, sub-lethal changes were observed in histology of nCsA/mCsA treated rat organs. Blank (drug-free) particles did not induce changes in the parameters studied. Therefore, it is extremely important that the encapsulated drug in the nano-products is considered when safety of the overall product is assessed rather than relying on just the particle size. This study has addressed some concerns surrounding particulate drug delivery, demonstrating safe delivery of CsA whilst achieving augmented serum concentrations. "
"Abstract: Ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced photoageing of the skin is associated with characteristic clinical features including a sallow complexion, deep, coarse wrinkles and a loss of elasticity. Remodelling of the dermal extracellular matrix (ECM) with changes to fibrillar collagens, elastic fibres and glycosaminoglycans is likely to be a major contributing factor to these particular clinical signs. Over-the-counter (OTC) topical formulations are one popular management strategy for preventing and/or repairing photoaged skin, most commonly targeting wrinkles as these are often the most concerning clinical feature. Due to the cosmetic nature of such formulations, evidence of their clinical efficacy and mechanism of action is often limited. However, these formulations usually contain putative active ingredients which individually have been subject to in vitro and in vivo investigation for efficacy as photoageing interventions. This review highlights commonly found ingredients within OTC formulations and assesses the evidence for: (i) their efficacy in clinically and histologically improving photoaged skin; (ii) the potential mechanisms of action; and (iii) their ability to act synergistically with complementary ingredients to enhance the clinical outcome. "
"Abstract: Retinol, has been shown to improve the appearance of photodamaged skin when applied topically, and is generally considered to be approximately ten times less potent than tretinoin. To assess this theory, three cosmetic formulations containing 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1.0% retinol were developed to correspond to the three commonly prescribed concentrations of tretinoin (0.025%, 0.05%, and 0.1%). A randomized, double-blind, split-face comparison study was conducted to compare the three concentrations retinol (Ret) including 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1.0%, against the respective three strengths of tretinoin (Tret) 0.025%, 0.05%, and 0.1% in subjects with moderate to severe facial photodamage. Subjects were randomized into three groups: Group 1 (Ret 0.25% vs. Tret 0.025%); Group 2 (Ret 0.5% vs. Tret 0.05%); and Group 3 (Ret 1.0% vs. Tret 0.1%). Within each group, subjects were randomized to apply Ret on one half of the face (left or right) and Tret on the other facial side, for a duration of twelve weeks. Clinical evaluations for efficacy and tolerability, as well as standardized digital photographs were conducted at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Sixty-five subjects completed the twelve-week study (Group 1: n=24, Group 2: n=20, and Group 3: n=21). At week 12 in all treatment groups, both Ret and Tret produced statistically significant improvements from baseline in all efficacy parameters, including overall photodamage, fine lines/wrinkles, coarse lines/wrinkles, skin tone brightness, mottled pigmentation, and tactile roughness (all P<0.001). There were no significant differences in efficacy between Ret and Tret in these efficacy parameters. Results from this comparison study suggest that this sustained-release retinol complex containing multiple agents for optimal irritation control provides comparable improvements to tretinoin in the appearance of photodamage.

"BACKGROUND: Vitamin C is commonly used to treat aged skin. It has shown regenerative effects on skin wrinkles, texture, strength, and evenness of tone through its roles as an antioxidant, tyrosinase inhibitor, and inducer of collagen synthesis. Available vitamin C formulations on the anti-aging skin care market vary by their pH, packaging, and vehicle, which may decrease absorption, and therefore, the efficacy of the product. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the subjective efficacy, wearability, tolerance and overall preference of two professional vitamin C topical serums and sunscreens in Caucasian females using a split face method. METHODS: A virtual split-face study of 39 Caucasian women compared two popular vitamin C and SPF product combinations - C-ESTA® Face Serum and Marini Physical Protectant SPF 45 (Jan Marini Skin, San Jose, CA; Products A) and CE Ferulic® and Physical Fusion UV Defense SPF 50 (Products B; SkinCeuticals Inc, Garland, TX). The products were assigned to each subject's left or right side of the face, and subjects rated and compared products through 5 online surveys at baseline, 24 hours, days 3, 7, and 14. RESULTS: Over 86% of the 35 subjects who completed the study preferred the smell and 83% preferred the feel and application of vitamin C Serum A over Serum B. Seventy-one percent of subjects preferred the feel and application of Sunscreen A over Sunscreen B. Results also showed a significant skin texture improvement and skin tone with Products A vs Product B. Products A trended higher for multiple additional categories. CONCLUSIONS: Products A exhibited superior anti-aging benefits than Products B. Subjects preferred the smell, feel, and application of Products A and experienced significantly less irritation than Products B. Overall, Products A were preferred over Products B with subjects willing to pay more for Products A over Products B. "
"Abstract: Undertreatment of pain (oligoanalgesia) in the emergency department is common, and it negatively impacts patient care. Both failure of appropriate pain assessment and the potential for unsafe analgesic use contribute to the problem. As a result, achieving satisfactory analgesia while minimizing side effects remains particularly challenging for emergency physicians, both in the emergency department and after a patient is discharged. Improvements in rapid pain assessment and in evaluation of noncommunicative populations may result in a better estimation of which patients require analgesia and how much pain is present. New formulations of available treatments, such as rapidly absorbed, topical, or intranasal nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug formulations or intranasal opioids, may provide effective analgesia with an improved risk-benefit profile. Other pharmacological therapies have been shown to be effective for certain pain modalities, such as the use of antidepressants for musculoskeletal pain, γ-aminobutyric acid agonists for neuropathic and postsurgical pain, antipsychotics for headache, and topical capsaicin for neuropathic pain. Nonpharmacological methods of pain control include the use of electrical stimulation, relaxation therapies, psychosocial/manipulative therapies, and acupuncture. Tailoring of available treatment options to specific pain modalities, as well as improvements in pain assessment, treatment options, and formulations, may improve pain control in the emergency department setting and beyond.

"Abstract: The rise in solar ultraviolet radiation on the earth's surface has led to a depletion of stratospheric ozone over recent decades, thus accelerating the need to protect human skin against the harmful effects of UV radiation such as erythema, edema, hyperpigmentation, photoaging, and skin cancer. There are many different ways to protect skin against UV radiation's harmful effects. The most popular way to reduce the amount of UV radiation penetrating the skin is topical application of sunscreen products that contain UV absorbing or reflecting active molecules. Based on their protection mechanism, the active molecules in sunscreens are broadly divided into inorganic and organic agents. Inorganic sunscreens reflect and scatter UV and visible radiation, while organic sunscreens absorb UV radiation and then re-emit energy as heat or light. These synthetic molecules have limited concentration according to regulation concern. Several natural compounds with UV absorption property have been used to substitute for or to reduce the quantity of synthetic sunscreen agents. In addition to UV absorption property, most natural compounds were found to act as antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory agents, which provide further protection against the damaging effects of UV radiation exposure. Compounds derived from natural sources have gained considerable attention for use in sunscreen products and have bolstered the market trend toward natural cosmetics. This adds to the importance of there being a wide selection of active molecules in sunscreen formulations. This paper summarizes a number of natural products derived from propolis, plants, algae, and lichens that have shown potential photoprotection properties against UV radiation exposure-induced skin damage.

"Abstract: The purpose of this study was to develop a novel 10-mg/mL infliximab eye drop, to characterize its physical and biological stability under recommended storage conditions, and to assess the formulation's toxicity to ocular surface epithelium in vitro. Infliximab (10 mg/mL) was reconstituted using equal volumes of sterile water and 1% carboxymethylcellulose artificial tears. Aliquots were stored in either a 4 degrees C refrigerator or -20 degrees C freezer for up to 45 days. Physical stability was assessed through monitoring the solution's appearance, pH, ultraviolet-visible-near infrared absorbance and scattering, as well as protein gel electrophoresis. Biological stability was assayed through binding to tumor necrosis factor-alpha using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In vitro cytotoxicity to human corneal-limbal epithelial cells was examined following a 4-hour exposure to the study drug. Refrigerated and frozen infliximab eye drops remained clear and colorless for the duration of study. The formulation's pH (7.0) was comparable to that of the artificial tear vehicle alone. Low levels of ultraviolet-visible-near infrared light absorbance and scattering established the lack of protein precipitate after refrigeration or freezing. Protein gel electrophoresis performed under reducing conditions revealed the presence of two main protein bands of approximately 50 kDa and 25 kDa, representing immunoglobulin G heavy and light chains. The migration pattern of the proteins did not change under the different storage conditions and between day 10 and 45 after formulation. Infliximab binding to tumor necrosis factor-alpha remained stable for up to 45 days, with conservation of 101% and 102% of its initial binding activity when refrigerated or frozen, respectively. In vitro human corneal-limbal epithelial cultures showed no increase in cytotoxicity with infliximab treatment when compared to vehicle and culture media controls (P > 0.05). Infliximab can be formulated as an eye drop and remains stable when stored in accordance with current regulations regarding compounded eye drops. The demonstrated physical and biological stability as well as in vitro innocuity of this infliximab eye drop formulation may facilitate future clinical investigation targeting tumor necrosis factor-alpha as a modulator of various ocular surface diseases.

"INTRODUCTION: Ultraviolet irradiation has deleterious effects on human skin, including tanning, sunburn, cancer and connective tissue degradation (photoaging). Botanical antioxidants have been shown to be associated with reduced incidence of photocarcinogenesis and photoaging through their photoprotective profile. AREAS COVERED: Here, the authors summarized therapeutic patent applications concerning the employment of medicinal plants on the technological development of a formulation with photoprotective or photoaging application. So, the patent search was conducted in the databases WIPO, Espacenet, USPTO and Derwent, using the keywords - photoaging, photoprotection and the IPC A61K 8/97 (cosmetics or similar cleaning supplies obtained from vegetable origin, for example, plant extracts) and A61K 36/00 (medicinal preparations of undetermined constitution containing material from algae, lichens, fungi or plants, or derivatives thereof, for example, traditional herbal medicines). We found 180 patents, out of which 25 were evaluated using inclusion criteria as application of natural products with photoprotective or photoaging application. EXPERT OPINION: We found that some patents related to the cosmetic compositions for improving skin wrinkle and either preventing or reducing the signs of photoaging and sunburn. The cosmetic compositions are manufactured in the form of a lotion, gel, soluble liquid, cream, essence, oil-in-water-type or water-in-oil-type formulation, containing the vegetal extracts as an active ingredient.

"Abstract: New biocides such as the organometallic compound zinc pyrithione (ZnP) have been massively introduced by many countries in formulations of antifouling paints following the ban on tributyltin (TBT). The effects of sublethal concentrations (LC50=82.5 μM, i.e., 26.2 mg/l) on cultured haemocytes of the ascidian Botryllus schlosseri have been investigated and compared with TBT. The percentage of haemocytes with amoeboid morphology and containing phagocytised yeast cells were significantly (p<0.05) reduced after exposure to 0.1 (31.7 μg/l) and 0.5 μM (158 μg/l), respectively. An antagonistic interaction in inducing cytoskeletal alterations was observed when ZnP and TBT were co-present in the exposure medium. ZnP affected only the actin component. As caused by TBT, ZnP induced apoptosis and inhibited both oxidative phosphorylation and lysosomal activities. In contrast to the case of TBT, a decrement in Ca(2+)-ATPase activity and a decrease in cytosolic Ca(2+) were detected after incubation at the highest concentration (1 μM, i.e., 317.7 μg/l) used. In comparison with other antifouling compounds, ZnP shows as much toxicity as TBT to cultured haemocytes at extremely low concentrations interfering with fundamental cell activities. "
"Abstract: The photocatalytic degradation of the herbicide sulcotrione (0.05 mM) and its formulated compound Tangenta® in aqueous suspensions of TiO2 Degussa P25 was examined as a function of the different operational parameters. The optimum of the catalyst loading was found to be 2.0 mg mL(-1) under UVA light. In the first stage of the reaction, the photocatalytic degradation of sulcotrione alone and in Tangenta® followed the pseudo-first order kinetics, in which the heterogeneous catalysis proceeds via OH and holes. Further, it can be concluded that degradation rate of sulcotrione alone is about two times higher compared to formulated compound. The results showed that the disappearance of sulcotrione led to the formation of three organic intermediates and ionic byproducts (Cl(-), SO4(2-), acetate and formate), whereas their mineralization was about 90% after 4 h. Tentative photodegradation pathways were proposed and discussed. Also, there was no significant toxicity observed after the irradiation of sulcotrione solution and Tangenta® formulation using TiO2 catalyst on three mammalian cell lines. "
"Abstract: Nasal deposition studies can demonstrate whether nasal sprays treating allergic rhinitis and polyposis reach the ciliated posterior nasal cavity, where turbinate inflammation and other pathology occurs. However, quantifying nasal deposition is challenging, because in vitro tests do not correlate to human nasal deposition; gamma scintigraphy studies are thus used. For valid data, the radiolabel must distribute, as the drug, into different-sized droplets, remain associated with the drug in the formulation after administration, and not alter its deposition. Some nasal deposition studies have demonstrated this using homogenous solutions. However, most commercial nasal sprays are heterogeneous suspensions. Using mometasone furoate nasal suspension (MFS), we developed a technique to validate radiolabel deposition as a surrogate for nasal cavity drug deposition and characterized regional deposition and nasal clearance in humans. Mometasone furoate (MF) formulation was spiked with diethylene triamine pentacaetic acid. Both unlabeled and radiolabeled formulations (n = 3) were sprayed into a regionally divided nasal cast. Drug deposition was quantified by high pressure liquid chromatography within each region; radiolabel deposition was determined by gamma camera. Healthy subjects (n = 12) were dosed and imaged for six hours. Scintigraphic images were coregistered with magnetic resonance imaging scans to quantify anterior and posterior nasal cavity deposition and mucociliary clearance. The ratio of radiolabel to unlabeled drug was 1.05 in the nasal cast and regionally appeared to match, indicating that in vivo radiolabel deposition could represent drug deposition. In humans, MFS delivered 86% (9.2) of metered dose to the nasal cavity, approximately 60% (9.1) of metered dose to the posterior nasal cavity. After 15 minutes, mucociliary clearance removed 59% of the initial radiolabel in the nasal cavity, consistent with clearance rates from the ciliated posterior surface. MFS deposited significant drug into the posterior nasal cavity. Both nasal cast validation and mucociliary clearance confirm the radiolabel deposition distribution method accurately represented corticosteroid nasal deposition. "
"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Vehicles used for topical therapy can affect drug delivery and patient adherence. This study compared the bioequivalence of 0.1% mometasone furoate lotion (reference) and 0.1% mometasone furoate hydrogel (test). Moisturising capacity and sensitivity/irritancy potential were also determined. METHODS: Bioequivalence was assessed by vasoconstriction assay and analysis of area under the effect curve (AUEC0-24 ) according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance. In total, 131 individuals were screened in a pilot dose duration-response study, and 90 responders enrolled. For the pivotal study, lotion and hydrogel (5 mg/cm(2) ) were applied in a double-blind manner. Vasoconstriction was evaluated by chromameter at 0, 2, 4, 6, 19 and 24 h following lotion and hydrogel removal. Barrier function was measured by assessment of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and skin hydration. Sensitivity/irritancy potential was assessed by repeat insult patch tests. RESULTS: The mean AUEC0-24 of the test hydrogel and reference lotion were -18.200 and -18.953, respectively, with test/reference = 96%, with 90% confidence interval (0.81, 1.12), which was within FDA guidance limits. TEWL was found to significantly decrease by 43 and 29% after 2 and 24 h, respectively, while skin hydration significantly increased by 38% after 24 h following a single application of hydrogel. The hydrogel was also found to be non-irritating and non-sensitising. No adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Mometasone furoate hydrogel is bioequivalent to mometasone furoate lotion. This novel hydrogel formulation provides effective drug delivery, increases moisturisation and affords greater ease and tolerability of application, improving patients' adherence to therapy. "
"OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of a dietary supplement (TARGET 1®: a combination of casozepine, taurine, Eleutherococcus senticosus and extramel) on burnout symptomatology. METHODS: A 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in workers engaged in professional contact with patients, students or clients. All were affected by burnout syndrome based on a score of ≥4 on the Burnout Measure Scale (BMS-10). The primary outcome measure was the change in the BMS-10 score; secondary outcome measures included the change in the Maslach's Burnout Inventory scale-Human Service Survey (MBI-HSS) score and the Beck Depression Inventory. Five scores were evaluated. RESULTS: Eighty-seven participants were enrolled in the study: 44 received the active formulation (verum group); 43 received placebo. After 12 weeks' supplementation, the placebo group showed significant improvements in scores for BMS-10, MBI-HSS fatigue and the Beck Depression Inventory, but MBI-HSS depersonalization and task management were not improved; the verum group showed significant improvements in all five scores. The verum group consistently showed significantly greater improvements in scores than the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: TARGET 1® significantly improved the symptoms of burnout after 12 weeks' use. "
"Abstract: This study aimed to assess the phototoxic potential of combined UV-filters and retinyl palmitate (RP) in the presence or not of bemotrizinol (BMTZ), employing photostability and in vitro and in vivo phototoxicity assays. The formulations tested contained octocrylene (OCT), octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC), benzophenone-3 (BZP-3) and RP (photostable) or octocrylene (OCT), octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC), avobenzone (AVO) and RP (less photostable). Both formulations were supplemented with bemotrizinol. Photostability was evaluated by exposing, or not, formulations spread on a glass plate to UVA/UVB irradiation. The resulting products were quantified by HPLC analysis. In vitro phototoxicity of UV-filters and combinations were evaluated using 3T3 viable monolayer fibroblast cultures submitted, or not, to irradiation according to OECD TG 432. In vivo photoallergy and photoxicity were assessed by clinical studies (photopatch test). Photostability assays showed that UV-filter bemotrizinol was a better photostabilizer for RP/benzophenone-3 than for RP/avobenzone. The in vitro phototoxicity of the combination RP/avobenzone was reduced by bemotrizinol. Clinical studies did not indicate phototoxic or photoallergenic potentials in all formulations tested. It is concluded that the 3T3 NRU phototoxicity test may be considered a supplementary assay in formulation developments, since it can detect chemically unstable and potentially phototoxic combinations. However, extrapolation of in vitro positive results to human photopatch tests may be performed only to a limited extent. "
"AIM: Topical corticosteroids and the vitamin D analogue calcipotriol are the cornerstone of therapy for patients with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis. Lack of patients' adherence leads to suboptimal effectiveness of topical therapy in real-life practice. The fixed combination betamethasone/calcipotriol gel is more effective and safe than the administration of single components and may enhance patients' adherence. We aimed at evaluating the pattern of care and dermatologists' expert opinion toward the available topical treatments for the management of mild-to-moderate psoriasis in Italy. METHODS: We enrolled 242 Italian dermatologists and collected information related to their practice pattern and opinion toward available topical treatments with a face-to-face structured interview. We evaluated dermatologists' ratings of therapy with 16 items tapping their opinion toward the relevance and satisfaction toward 8 therapy attributes in clinical practices which tapped aspects of real-life effectiveness, adherence promotion, toxicity, convenience of use. Ratings occurred along a 10-point scale. We compared single-attribute and weighted overall therapy ratings across alternative treatment options with random-intercept linear models to account for ratings clustering within dermatologists. RESULTS: There was a wide variation in practice patterns: 1/3 of dermatologist had seen more than 30 patients with psoriasis while around 1/4 had seen less than 10 patients. The fixed combination betamethasone/calcipotriol gel was considered superior to monotherapies in all the eight attributes considered which tapped aspects of real-life effectiveness, adherence promotion, toxicity, convenience of use. CONCLUSION: Participant dermatologists' strongly preferred the fixed betamethasone/calcipotriol combination gel over both the fixed combination ointment formulation and corticosteroid or vitamin D analogues monotherapies. Such findings are in line with evidence from randomized controlled trials and few observational studies demonstrating superior clinical outcomes, quality of life, tolerability and lower risk of side effect in patients treated with the fixed combination of betamethasone/calcipotriol gel. "
"Abstract: Hydrocortisone cream intended for atopic eczema often produces unwanted side effects after long-term use. These side effects are essentially due to repeated percutaneous administration of the medication for skin dermatitis, as atopic eczema is a relapsing disorder. Hence, there is a need to develop a new hydrocortisone formulation that will deliver the drug more effectively and require a reduced dosing frequency; therefore, the side effects could be minimized. In this study, a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) lyogel system based on 80% organic and 20% aqueous solvents containing 1% hydrocortisone was formulated. The hydrocortisone lyogel physicochemical characteristics, rheological properties, stability profile, and in vitro Franz cell drug release properties, as well as the in vivo therapeutic efficacies and dermal irritancy in Balb/c mice were investigated. The HPMC lyogel appeared clear and soft and was easy to rub on the skin. The lyogel also showed a higher drug release profile compared with commercial hydrocortisone cream. Similar to the cream, HPMC lyogels exhibited pseudoplastic behavior. From the mouse model, the hydrocortisone lyogel showed higher inflammatory suppressive effects than the cream. However, it did not reduce the transepidermal water loss as effectively as the control did. The dermal irritancy testing revealed that the hydrocortisone lyogel caused minimal irritation. In conclusion, HPMC lyogel is a promising vehicle to deliver hydrocortisone topically, as it showed a higher drug release in vitro as well as enhanced therapeutic efficacy in resolving eczematous inflammatory reaction compared with commercial cream. "
"Abstract: Dithranol is a very effective drug for the topical treatment of psoriasis. However, it has some adverse effects such as irritation and stain in the skin that make its application and patient adherence to treatment difficult. The aims of this work were to prepare and characterize dithranol-loaded nanocapsules as well as to evaluate the photostability and the irritation potential of these nanocarriers. Lipid-core nanocapsules containing dithranol (0.5 mg/mL) were prepared by interfacial deposition of preformed polymer. EDTA (0.05%) or ascorbic acid (0.02%) was used as antioxidants. After preparation, dithranol-loaded lipid-core nanocapsules showed satisfactory characteristics: drug content close to the theoretical concentration, encapsulation efficiency of about 100%, nanometric mean size (230-250 nm), polydispersity index below 0.25, negative zeta potential, and pH values from 4.3 to 5.6. In the photodegradation study against UVA light, we observed a higher stability of the dithranol-loaded lipid-core nanocapsules comparing to the solution containing the free drug (half-life times around 4 and 1h for the dithranol-loaded lipid-core nanocapsules and free drug solution containing EDTA, respectively; half-life times around 17 and 7h for the dithranol-loaded lipid-core nanocapsules and free drug solution containing ascorbic acid, respectively). Irritation test by HET-CAM method was conducted to evaluate the safety of the formulations. From the results it was found that the nanoencapsulation of the drug decreased its toxicity compared to the effects observed for the free drug. "
"Abstract: Cyclosporine A (CsA) is used for the treatment of psoriasis; however systemic administration of CsA is potentially life threatening and there are long-term side effects. Topical application of CsA has the potential to overcome this hurdle; however, its use is limited by poor water solubility and low permeability. Here, we report the use of a physical mixture of SPACE-peptide and CsA in an aqueous ethanol solution to enhance the dermal absorption of the drug. The aqueous ethanol solution (hydroethanolic solution) containing 5mg/mL CsA and 50mg/mL of free SPACE-peptide (SP50) delivered about 30% of topically applied CsA into the porcine skin in vitro and led to an approximately 9-fold (p<0.01) increase in accumulation in viable epidermis compared to the hydroethanolic solution without SPACE-peptide (control group). In vivo biodistribution and pharmacokinetic studies performed using SKH1 hairless mice also confirmed the efficacy of SP50 in dermal delivery of CsA and also demonstrated its advantages over other routes in terms of minimizing its systemic absorption. Topical application of SP50 significantly increased the localization of CsA in the target skin (113.1±13.6(μg/g)/mg) compared to all other groups (p<0.01). In addition, SP50 led to significantly higher skin/blood ratio (443.4±181.5) and skin/liver ratio (1059.5±110.8) of CsA compared to all other groups (p<0.01). The SP50 formulation reported here offers a promising approach for the dermal delivery of CsA. "
"UNLABELLED: Along with widespread usage of QDs in electronic and biomedical industries, the likelihood of QDs exposure to the environment and humans is deemed to occur when the QD products are degraded or handled as waste for processing. To date, there are very few toxicological reports available in the literature for non-cadmium QDs in animal models. In this work, we studied the long term in vivo toxicity of InP/ZnS QDs in BALB/c mice. The biodistribution, body weight, hematology, blood biochemistry, and organ histology were determined at a very high dosage (25 mg/kg) of InP/ZnS QDs over 84 days period. Our results manifested that the QDs formulation did not result in observable toxicity in vivo within the evaluation period, thereby suggesting that the InP/ZnS QDs can be utilized as optical probes or nanocarrier for selected in vivo biological applications when an optimized dosage is employed. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: This study investigated the toxicity of quantum dots in BALB/c mice, and concluded that no organotoxicity was detectable despite of using high concentration of InP/ZnS quantum dots with prolonged exposure of 3 months.

"Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with significant disability, morbidity, early mortality, and substantial financial burden. Despite newer antirheumatics, methotrexate (MTX) remains the most widely used disease-modifying antirheumatic drug. Subcutaneous (SC) MTX provides consistent, reliable delivery, with improved absorption and enhanced polyglutamization leading to increased response rates and fewer gastrointestinal side effects than oral MTX. Optimizing MTX with use of the SC formulation can improve outcomes and may delay or negate the need for costly biologics. "
"Abstract: The inhalation of zinc oxide engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) has been linked to cardiorespiratory dysfunction in mammalian models but the effects of aquatic ENM exposure on fish have not been fully investigated. Nano-zinc oxide (nZnO) is widely used in consumer products such as sunscreens and can make its way into aquatic ecosystems from domestic and commercial wastewater. This study examined the impact of an environmentally relevant nZnO formulation on cardiorespiratory function and energy metabolism in the white sucker (Catostomus commersonii), a freshwater teleost fish. Evidence of oxidative and cellular stress was present in gill tissue, including increases in malondialdehyde levels, heat shock protein (HSP) expression, and caspase 3/7 activity. Gill Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity was also higher by approximately three-fold in nZnO-treated fish, likely in response to increased epithelial permeability or structural remodeling. Despite evidence of toxicity in gill, plasma cortisol and lactate levels did not change in animals exposed to 1.0 mg L(-1) nZnO. White suckers also exhibited a 35% decrease in heart rate during nZnO exposure, with no significant changes in resting oxygen consumption or tissue energy stores. Our results suggest that tissue damage or cellular stress resulting from nZnO exposure activates gill neuroepithelial cells, triggering a whole-animal hypoxic response. An increase in parasympathetic nervous signaling will decrease heart rate and may reduce energy demand, even in the face of an environmental toxicant. We have shown that acute exposure to nZnO is toxic to white suckers and that ENMs have the potential to negatively impact cardiorespiratory function in adult fish. "
"Abstract: Carbohydrate functionalization of nanoparticles allows for targeting of C-type lectin receptors. This family of pattern recognition receptors expressed on innate immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, can be used to modulate immune responses. In this work, the in vivo safety profile of carbohydrate-functionalized polyanhydride nanoparticles was analyzed following parenteral and intranasal administration in mice. Polyanhydride nanoparticles based on 1,6-bis-(p-carboxyphenoxy)hexane and 1,8-bis-(p-carboxyphenoxy)-3,6-dioxaoctane were used. Nanoparticle functionalization with di-mannose (specifically carboxymethyl-α-D-mannopyranosyl-(1,2)-D-mannopyranoside), galactose (specifically carboxymethyl-β-galactoside), or glycolic acid induced no adverse effects after administration based on histopathological evaluation of liver, kidneys, and lungs. Regardless of the polymer formulation, there was no evidence of hepatic or renal damage or dysfunction observed in serum or urine samples. The histological profile of cellular infiltration and the cellular distribution and kinetics in the lungs of mice administered with nanoparticle treatments followed similar behavior as that observed in the lungs of animals administered with saline. Cytokine and chemokine profiles in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid indicated surface chemistry dependence on modest secretion of IL-6, IP-10, and MCP-1; however, there was no evidence of any deleterious histopathological changes. Based on these analyses, carbohydrate-functionalized nanoparticles are safe for in vivo applications. These results provide foundational information towards the evaluation of the capabilities of these surface-modified nanoparticles as vaccine delivery formulations. "
"INTRODUCTION: Posttransplant early calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-induced neurotoxicity (ECIIN) was related to high CNI levels, among other factors. Minimizing exposure could modify its incidence or clinical evolution. OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence, predisposing factors, and clinical evolution of ECIIN after immunosuppressive induction with low-dose tacrolimus-MR (Advagraf) or conventional dose tacrolimus (Prograf). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We matched 71 patients treated with an immunosuppression induction schedule with basiliximab and low doses of Advagraf (cases group) 1:1 by recipient age and indication for liver transplantation (OLT) with patients treated with a conventional tacrolimus regimen (control group). Baseline characteristics, liver and kidney function, operative technical characteristics, kidney function, and C0 tacrolimus levels at several time points after liver OLT were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 31 cases of ECIIN (21%), 14 in the cases group (20%) and 17 in the control group (24%; P < .001). The incidence of ECIIN was higher in alcoholic liver disease (odds ratio [OR], 8.2; 95% CI, 2.3-28.6; P < .001) and past history of encephalopathy (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.16-5.9; P < .02). Among cases, the incidence of ECIIN was higher when encephalopathy signs were present at time of transplantation (36% vs 12%; P < .001). Control of ECIIN required a switch to cyclosporine therapy in all those in the cases group, whereas this was only needed for 9 cases in the control group (47%; P < .001). CONCLUSION: In this study, although the incidence rate of neurotoxicity induced by Advagraf was lower than the induced by Prograf, it did not respond to routine treatment and required a significantly higher rate of switch to cyclosporine for its control. "
"INTRODUCTION: Ketoconazole was the first broad-spectrum oral antifungal approved by the FDA in 1981. Post-marketing reports of drug-related hepatotoxicity, endocrine dysregulation and drug interactions resulted in market withdrawal of the drug in some countries and strict product relabeling in others. AREAS COVERED: This drug safety review summarizes reports of oral ketoconazole-related adverse events retrieved from a search of the PubMed database using the search strategy 'ketoconazole OR Nizoral AND hepat*', references from relevant publications, and data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System. EXPERT OPINION: Although oral ketoconazole is effective in treating fungal infections, the potential for drug interactions, endocrine dysregulation, and hepatotoxicity may outweigh its benefits. Newer oral antifungals have similar or greater efficacy in treating dermatologic conditions and are associated with less risk. Likewise, newer agents with specific targets and fewer drug interactions have been developed to treat systemic fungal infections. Therefore, by the time ketoconazole prescribing guidelines were amended, its use had already largely been replaced with newer antifungals. Being that ketoconazole was the first broad-spectrum oral antifungal, experience with the drug made patient safety, and especially hepatic safety, an important consideration in future antifungal development. "
"Abstract: Cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT) by photosensitizers (PS)-loaded polymeric micelles (PM) is hampered by the tendency of PS to aggregate in PM and/or by premature release of PS in the blood circulation. In the present study, aromatic thermosensitive PM, characterized by π-π stacking interaction, are used to encapsulate an axially solketal-substituted silicon phthalocyanine (Si(sol)2 Pc) with enhanced loading capacity, smaller size, and significantly improved retention of Si(sol)2 Pc compared with systems based on thermosensitive PM lacking aromatic groups. Interestingly, Si(sol)2 Pc is much less prone to aggregation in the aromatic PM, i.e., the amount of Si(sol)2 Pc that could be encapsulated without aggregation is 330 times higher in the aromatic PM than in the nonaromatic PM. Furthermore, Si(sol)2 Pc in the aromatic PM in a molecularly dissolved (non-aggregated) form displays three times more efficient singlet oxygen production than Si(sol)2 Pc aggregated in the non-aromatic PM. As a result, the photocytotoxicity of Si(sol)2 Pc-loaded aromatic PM to B16F10 cells is increased, compared with that of the non-aromatic PM, while no significant cytotoxicity is observed in the dark. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) analysis shows cell uptake of Si(sol)2 Pc loaded in the aromatic PM, and the Si(sol)2 Pc is taken up by the cells together with the micelles. The efficient singlet oxygen production of Si(sol)2 Pc dissolved in the aromatic PM makes it an interesting formulation for cancer PDT. "
"CONTEXT: Intravitreal (ITV) dosing has become a clinically important route of administration for the treatment of uveitis, endophthalmitis, retinal vein occlusion, diabetic macular edema and age-related macular degeneration. Despite this, there are no validated non-clinical models of phototoxicity for ITV products. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop an ITV rabbit model of phototoxicity for use in assessing the photosafety of small molecules therapeutics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dutch Belted rabbits were intravitreally injected bilaterally with four known phototoxicants: 8-methoxypsoralen, lomefloxacin, doxycycline and stannsoporfrin. Triescence(®), a non-phototoxic triamcinolone acetonide steroid formulation designed for ITV administration, was used as a negative control. One eye was then irradiated with solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation for 30 min, 1 h after dosing, while the other eye was occluded, serving as a non-irradiated control. RESULTS: Despite the direct administration of known phototoxicants into the vitreous, no evidence of ocular phototoxicity was observed in any dose group. Direct (non-phototoxic) retinal toxicity was observed in the doxycycline dose group only. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the posterior segment of the rabbit eye is protected against phototoxicity by anatomical and/or physiological mechanisms, and is not a useful model for the assessment of phototoxicity of intravitreally administered molecules.

"Abstract: Zn is an essential element for plants yet some soils are Zn-deficient and/or have low Zn-bioavailability. This paper addresses the feasibility of using ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) as soil amendments to improve Zn levels in the plant. The effects of soil properties on phytotoxicity and Zn bioavailability from the NPs were studied by using an acidic and a calcareous alkaline soil. In the acid soil, the ZnO NPs caused dose-dependent phytotoxicity, observed as inhibition of elongation of roots of wheat, Triticum aestivum. Phytotoxicity was mitigated in the calcareous alkaline soil although uptake of Zn from the ZnO NPs occurred doubling the Zn level compared to control plants. This increase occurred with a low level of Zn in the soil solution as expected from the interactions of Zn with the soil components at the alkaline pH. Soluble Zn in the acid soil was 200-fold higher and shoot levels were tenfold higher than from the alkaline soil correlating with phytotoxicity. Mitigation of toxicity was not observed in plants grown in sand amended with a commercial preparation of humic acid: growth, shoot uptake and solubility of Zn from the NPs was not altered by the humic acid. Thus, variation in humic acid between soils may not be a major factor influencing plant responses to the NPs. These findings illustrate that formulations of ZnO NPs to be used as a soil amendment would need to be tuned to soil properties to avoid phytotoxicity yet provide increased Zn accumulations in the plant.

"BACKGROUND: Evidence on efficacy and safety of topical treatments for paediatric scalp psoriasis is lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate scalp formulation for paediatric scalp psoriasis in daily clinical practice. The influence of this formulation on the quality of life (QoL) was assessed as well. METHODS: Data of children treated with the scalp formulation were extracted from a prospective observational daily clinical practice registry of children with psoriasis, called Child-Continuous Assessment of Psoriasis Treatment Use Registry. Severity was expressed by Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) and the impact on the QoL was reflected by the validated Children's Scalpdex in Psoriasis (CSP). RESULTS: Eighty-four treatment episodes were analysed. Significant improvements of PSSI score (18.7 ± 11.8 to 12.7 ± 9.4) were demonstrated in the first 12 weeks and this result was well maintained during 48 weeks of follow-up. Three patients (4.1%) developed striae of the skin (arms, trunk and legs), which are possibly related to the scalp formulation. CSP scores (79.0-46.3) declined significantly after 3 months. CONCLUSION: In a daily clinical practice cohort of children with scalp psoriasis, calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate scalp formulation was effective with a 32.1% improvement of PSSI at week 12 and a maintenance of this effect until 48 weeks of follow-up, in combination with improvement of QoL.

"PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy of various formulations of chlorhexidine 0.2% (CHX) in terms of plaque and gingival bleeding control compared to each other and to saline rinse (CTRL) over a 35-day rinsing period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy subjects were randomly allocated to one of 4 groups rinsing twice daily for 35 days. The different groups used CHX 0.2% rinse with alcohol (CHX1) and without alcohol (CHX2), with an antidiscolouration system (CHX3) or saline rinse (CTRL). Clinical examinations to evaluate full-mouth plaque scores (FMPS) and periodontal parameters were performed at baseline, 7, 21 and 35 days. Tooth discolouration (TD) was measured at each time point using digital photographs and spectrophotometric analysis. RESULTS: At 35 days, CTRL showed the highest levels of plaque. The mean changes in FMPS from baseline were 69.8% ± 6.8 for CHX1, 57.5% ± 9.8 for CHX2, 43.7% ± 9.8 for CHX3 and 25.8% ± 7.7 for CTRL. Statistically significant differences were demonstrated between CHX1 and CHX3 (p = 0.02), CHX2 vs CHX3 (p ≤ 0.05) and CHX1/CHX2 vs CHX3 (p < 0.05). In contrast, CHX3 appeared more effective in reducing inflammatory indexes. TD increased over time in 60% to 70% of participants, although lighter staining was found in the CHX3 group. Greater FMPS reduction was observed in participants with staining vs without staining (26.0% ± 12.3, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Conventional CHX appeared more effective in terms of plaque reduction. Interestingly, the newest formulation showed a higher control of gingival inflammation. Staining was associated with lower plaque levels. "
"Abstract: Oral administration of ciclosporin A (CsA) is indicated in the treatment of severe recalcitrant plaque psoriasis. However, CsA is both nephro- and hepatotoxic and its systemic administration also exposes the patient to other severe side effects. Although topical delivery of CsA, targeted directly to psoriatic skin, would offer significant advantages, there are no topical formulations approved for dermatological use. The aim of this work was to formulate CsA loaded polymeric micelles using the biodegradable and biocompatible MPEG-dihexPLA diblock copolymer and to evaluate their potential for delivering the drug selectively into the skin without concomitant transdermal permeation. Micelle formulations were characterised with respect to drug content, size and morphology. Micelle and drug penetration pathways were subsequently visualised with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) using fluorescein labelled CsA (Fluo-CsA) and Nile-Red (NR) labelled copolymer. Visualisation studies typically use fluorescent dyes as ""model drugs""; however, these may have different physicochemical properties to the drug molecule under investigation. Therefore, in this study it was decided to chemically modify CsA and to use this structurally similar fluorescent analogue to visualise molecular distribution and transport pathways. Molecular modelling techniques and experimental determination of log D served as molecular scale and macroscopic methods to compare the lipophilicity of CsA and Fluo-CsA. The spherical, homogeneous and nanometre-scale micelles (with Zav from 25 to 52 nm) increased the aqueous solubility of CsA by 518-fold. Supra-therapeutic amounts of CsA were delivered to human skin (1.4±0.6 μg/cm2, cf. a statistically equivalent 1.1±0.5 μg/cm2 for porcine skin) after application of the formulation with the lowest CsA and copolymer content (1.67±0.03 mg/ml of CsA and 5mg/ml of copolymer) for only 1h without concomitant transdermal permeation. Fluo-CsA was successfully synthesised, characterised and incorporated into fluorescent NR-MPEG-dihexPLA micelles; its conformation was not modified by the addition of fluorescein and its log D, measured from pH4 to 8, was equivalent to that of CsA. Fluo-CsA and NR-MPEG-dihexPLA copolymer were subsequently visualised in skin by CLSM. The images indicated that micelles were preferentially deposited between corneocytes and in the inter-cluster regions (i.e. between the clusters of corneocytes). Fluo-CsA skin penetration was deeper in these structures, suggesting that inter-cluster penetration is probably the preferred transport pathway responsible for the increased cutaneous delivery of CsA.

"Abstract: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) widely used in the treatment of major depression. It has been detected in surface and wastewaters, being able to negatively affect aquatic organisms. Most of the ecotoxicity studies focused only in pharmaceuticals, though excipients can also pose a risk to non-target organisms. In this work the ecotoxicity of five medicines (three generic formulations and two brand labels) containing the same active substance (fluoxetine hydrochloride) was tested on the alga Chlorella vulgaris, in order to evaluate if excipients can influence their ecotoxicity. Effective concentrations that cause 50% of inhibition (EC50) ranging from 0.25 to 15 mg L⁻¹ were obtained in the growth inhibition test performed for the different medicines. The corresponding values for fluoxetine concentration are 10 times lower. Higher EC50 values had been published for the same alga considering only the toxicity of fluoxetine. Therefore, this increase in toxicity may be attributed to the presence of excipients. Thus more studies on ecotoxicological effects of excipients are required in order to assess the environmental risk they may pose to aquatic organisms. "
Abstract: α-Hydroxy acid (AHA) formulations are commonly used for skin chemical peelings. The primary target is the stratum corneum (SC). The aim of this study was to assess the effects of various glycolic acid concentrations and commercial phenolic acid formulations on the SC. Quantitative colorimetry of a corneoxenometry bioassay was used. The test procedure involved glycolic acid concentrations ranging from 3% to 70% in alcoholic solution. Exposure times were set for 1 min and 3 min. The bioassay showed consistent reactivity with a dose-effect relationship when using the selected low exposure times. In a similar procedure the aggressiveness of commercially available phenolic acid formulations was identified not using hazardous in vivo testing. Corneoxenometry appears useful for in vitro testing of AHA peeling agents during short exposure times. 
"Abstract: Over the past few years, nanoparticles and their role in drug delivery have been the centre of attraction as new drug delivery systems. Various forms of nanosystems have been designed, such as nanoclays, scaffolds and nanotubes, having numerous applications in areas such as drug loading, target cell uptake, bioassay and imaging. The present study discusses various types of nanoparticles, with special emphasis on ceramic nanocarriers. Ceramic materials have high mechanical strength, good body response and low or non-existing biodegradability. In this article, the various aspects concerning ceramic nanoparticles, such as their advantages over other systems, their cellular uptake and toxicity concerns are discussed in detail. "
"UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND & SCOPE OF THE REVIEW: This review focuses on the UV radiation effects on skin, emphasizing the photoaging process, and the photoprotection conferred by tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid or ATRA). Tretinoin is still the best tested retinoid to reverse photoaged skin. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Tretinoin can be used for photoaging treatment or combined treatment by different mechanisms. It binds to and activates retinoic acid receptors, inducing changes in gene expression that leads to cell differentiation, decreased cell proliferation, and inhibition of tumourigenesis. It has been demonstrated that photoaging resulting from UV-B radiation can be treated by retinoid formulations. Pretreatment of human skin with tretinoin blocks dermal matrix degradation followed by sun exposure, inhibiting the induction of the activated protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor and AP-1 regulated matrix-degrading metalloproteinases. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE AND INTEREST: Tretinoin should be considered as a key factor as it is the most potent and best-studied retinoid. In addition, the development of advanced drug delivery systems, especially novel nanoformulations, has contributed to overpass some technical drawbacks besides the skin irritation potential. The triple combination of tretinoin, hydroquinone and corticosteroids is still considered the gold standard for melasma. Although there are other novel therapeutic approaches, more high-quality clinical trials are still needed. "
"Abstract: Recently, we reported the synthesis and biocompatibility of alkoxylphenacyl-based polycarbonates (APP); a promising new class of polymers that undergo photo-induced chain scission. In the current study, nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared from the APP polymer (APP-NPs) and loaded with doxorubicin (DOX) (DOX-APP-NPs) in order to identify and evaluate formulation and photoirradiation parameters that influence photoresponsive efficacy. Stable and spherical APP-NPs were prepared with diameters between 70-80nm depending on APP concentration (10-40mg/mL). There was a direct relationship between APP concentration and resultant particle size. Drug release studies indicated that exposure to the photo-trigger was capable of altering the rate and extent of DOX released. Photoresponsive DOX release was markedly influenced by the frequency of photoirradiation while the effect of APP concentration was most likely propagated through NP size. DOX released by photoactivation retained its efficacy as assessed by cytotoxicity studies in human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cells. Studies in BALB/c mice indicated that DOX-APP-NPs induce less cardiotoxicity than DOX alone and that DOX-APP-NPs are not susceptible to dose dumping after photoirradiation. "
"BACKGROUND: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains as one of the most difficult malignancies to control because of its high propensity for local invasion and cervical lymph node dissemination. The aim of present study was to evaluate the efficacy of novel pH and temperature sensitive doxorubicin-methotrexate- loaded nanoparticles (DOX-MTX NP) in terms of their potential to change the VEGF-C expression profile in a rat OSCC model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 120 male rats were divided into 8 groups of 15 animals administrated with 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide to induce OSCCs. Newly formulated doxorubicin-methotrexate-loaded nanoparticles (DOX-MTX NP) and free doxorubicin were IV and orally administered. RESULTS: RESULTS indicated that both oral and IV forms of DOX-MTX- nanoparticle complexes caused significant decrease in the mRNA level of VEGF-C compared to untreated cancerous rats (p<0.05) . Surprisingly, the VEGF-C mRNA was not affected by free DOX in both IV and oral modalities (p>0.05). Furthermore, in DOX-MTX NP treated group, less tumors characterized with advanced stage and VEGF-C mRNA level paralleled with improved clinical outcome (p<0.05). In addition, compared to untreated healthy rats , the VEGF-C expression was not affected in healthy groups that were treated with IV and oral dosages of nanodrug (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: VEGF-C is one of the main prognosticators for lymph node metastasis in OSCC. Down-regulation of this lymph-angiogenesis promoting factor is a new feature acquired in group treated with dual action DOX-MTX-NPs. Beside the synergic apoptotic properties of concomitant use of DOX and MTX on OSCC, DOX-MTX NPs possessed anti-angiogenesis properties which was related to the improved clinical outcome in treated rats. Taking together, we conclude that our multifunctional doxorubicin-methotrexate complex exerts specific potent apoptotic and anti-angiogenesis properties that could ameliorate the clinical outcome presumably via down-regulating dissemination factor-VEGF-C expression in a rat OSCC model.

"Abstract: Skin care products are recognized by dermatologists as critical adjunctive therapeutic modalities for patients suffering from acne vulgaris (AV). Prescribing an acne medication without reviewing a patient's skin care regimen can lead to poor compliance, intolerable side effects, and resulting patient and physician frustration. Striking that delicate balance between maintaining the skin barrier while controlling oil and shine has always been a challenge when treating this chronic inflammatory condition, and it necessitates a unique set of ingredients and formulation. Cetaphil® DermaControl™ Moisturizer SPF 30 (Galderma Laboratories, L.P., Fort Worth, Texas) is a new generation of skin care specifically designed for acne-prone skin and acne-affected skin. Both Cetaphil® DermaControl™ Foam Wash and Cetaphil DermaControl Moisturizer SPF 30 incorporate pharmacologically tested, state-of-the-art ingredients and technologies that studies have shown impart substantial benefits to AV patients.

"Abstract: An effective way for promoting photocatalytic activity of a semiconductor is deposition of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) onto it. In this paper, we deposited Ag and Pd onto ZnO NPs to form ZnO/Ag and ZnO/Pd hybrid nanostructures. It was found that both Ag and Pd nanocomponents can greatly enhance the photocatalytic activity and phototoxicity of ZnO toward human skin cells. Using electron spin resonance spectroscopy with spin trapping and spin labeling techniques, we observed that either deposition of Ag or Pd resulted in a significant increase in photogenerated electrons and holes and production of reactive oxygen species including hydroxyl radicals, superoxide, and singlet oxygen. We compared the enhancing effects of Ag and Pd and found that Pd is more effective than Ag in promoting the generation of hydroxyl radicals and holes and the photocatalytic activity of ZnO. Conversely, Ag is more effective than Pd in enhancing electron transfer and the generation of superoxide and singlet oxygen. The mechanism underlying the differences in the effects of Ag and Pd may be related to differences in Fermi levels for Ag and Pd and band bending accompanied by effects on Schottky barriers. The results of these studies provide information valuable for designing hybrid nanomaterials having photocatalytic and photobiological activities useful for applications such as water purification and formulation of antibacterial products.

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide opinions on the potential impact of increasing use of steroids by various formulations, as recent approvals have switched intranasal steroids to over-the-counter (OTC) status. Systemic glucocorticosteroids are the predominant formulations available only by prescription, whereas low-dose dermatological formulations are also available OTC. The recently approved OTC intranasal steroid has generated questions on their potential adverse effects, especially on the eye. RECENT FINDINGS: Oral and ophthalmic steroids have the most potent impact on the development of increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and lens opacifications (ILO), but other factors such as age, race and comorbidities (e.g. hypertension, diabetes and smoking) also play a role. There are no biomarkers that have been established to identify populations at additional risk. However, individuals of Caribbean, African, Hispanic or Asian ancestry have a higher predilection for the development of glaucoma and thus may be predisposed to IOP. ILO has been noted to have a slight increase with intranasal corticosteroids, but no specific correlations with the development of cataracts. SUMMARY: The OTC placement of intranasal steroid may cause a subset of genetically sensitive individuals to earlier development of IOP and ILO, but the socioeconomic benefit for patients with allergies having access to the 'OTC open formulary' appears to warrant consideration with caveats of monitoring the effect at large, especially in susceptible populations such as those with a family history or specific ancestries.

"Abstract: There is limited information available regarding patient preferences and attributes of topical product formulations for specific dermatologic conditions. This study focused on product attributes that were most desirable for 3 dermatologic conditions: acne, atopic dermatitis (AD), and plaque psoriasis (PP). Six focus groups were conducted with participants self-reporting 1 of these conditions and use of 2 or more topical treatments. Discussion focused on symptoms, treatments tried, and vehicle attributes. Fifty-four subjects participated: acne, n=19; AD, n=18; and PP, n=17. The most commonly reported prescription medication vehicles were creams and ointments, followed by lotions, gels, and foams. Itching and redness were the only symptoms spontaneously reported across all 6 focus groups. The attributes considered most important across all conditions included: moisturizing, absorbs/disappears/dries quickly, available in various formulations, does not bleach or stain skin/hair/clothing, is not greasy or oily, is not sticky or tacky, is long lasting/long acting, is fragrance or odor free, is easy to apply/simple to use, and can use all the time. Preferences attributable to acne included: easy to dispense/dispenses right amount, nondrying, product goes on/spreads smoothly, container is not easily broken/does not leak, and creamy. Preferences attributable to AD included: not noticeable to others/conceals area, good consistency, and cooling. Patient preference for product vehicle is relevant to adherence as compliance is a major factor for high rates of failure for dermatologic treatments. "
"PURPOSE: Treatment with topical eye drops for long-standing ocular diseases like allergy can induce detrimental side effects. The purpose of this study was to investigate in vitro cytotoxicity of commercially preserved and unpreserved anti-allergic eye drops on the viability and barrier function of monolayer and stratified human corneal-limbal epithelial cells. METHODS: Cells were treated with unpreserved ketotifen solution, benzalkonium chloride (BAC)-containing anti-allergic drugs (ketotifen, olopatadine, levocabastine) as well as BAC alone. 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to determine cell viability. Effects of compounds on barrier function were analyzed measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) to determine paracellular permeability and rose bengal assays to evaluate transcellular barrier formation. RESULTS: The BAC-preserved anti-allergic formulations and BAC alone significantly reduced cell viability, monolayer cultures being more sensitive to damage by these solutions. Unpreserved ketotifen induced the least diminution in cell viability. The extent of decrease of cell viability was clearly dependent of BAC presence, but it was also affected by the different types of drugs when the concentration of BAC was low and the short time of exposure. Treatment with BAC-containing anti-allergic drugs and BAC alone resulted in increased paracellular permeability and loss of transcellular barrier function as indicated by TEER measurement and rose bengal assays. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the preservative BAC in anti-allergic eye drop formulations contributes importantly to the cytotoxic effects induced by these compounds. Stratified cell cultures seem to be a more relevant model for toxicity evaluation induced on the ocular surface epithelia than monolayer cultures. "
"Abstract: Acne is prevalent among adolescents and adults with significant psychological effects. Standard oral and topical therapies can have significant side effects including skin irritation, gastrointestinal upset, and the development of drug-resistant bacteria. The use of botanicals and phytochemicals in dermatological products is increasingly popular, and many patients are turning to these alternative therapies for treatment of acne. This study aimed to systematically review clinical studies that have investigated the use of botanical agents in the treatment of acne. PubMed and Embase databases were searched in March 2013 for trials assessing botanical therapies in the treatment of acne vulgaris. Data from these trials are presented, and methodology of each study is assessed. Twenty-three trials met inclusion criteria. Interventions included plant extracts, herbal formulations, and phytochemicals. All studies reported favorable results, and several showed equal or superior treatment to standard therapies. No serious adverse events were reported. Few studies were methodologically rigorous. Each botanical was studied in only one or two trials. Botanicals are promising therapies for acne vulgaris although further research is warranted, especially with regard to severe acne and acne resistant to conventional therapy. There is a need for standardized methods for grading acne and assessing therapeutic effects. "
"OBJECTIVE: Sunscreens containing UVA absorbers in high concentrations are expected to be developed, since recent studies have suggested the possibility of involvement of UVA ray in skin cancer and early skin aging. Solubility and stability of supersaturation of UVA absorbers in UVB absorber were determined in the absence and the presence of cosmetic oil. Coexistence effect of UVA absorbers was analyzed to dissolve them in high concentrations. METHODS: Two UVA absorbers, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (DHHB) and butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (BMDM), a UVB absorber, 2-ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC), and a cosmetic oil, 2-ethylhexyl ester of oligomer of hydroxystearic acid (EH-O-HSA), were used. Their solutions were prepared at 80°C and cooled to 5°C. The solid DHHB and/or BMDM were added to it, and the time evolution of concentrations of the UVA absorbers in the solution phase was monitored. RESULTS: At the saturation in the absence of EH-O-HSA at 5°C, weight ratio of DHHB and BMDM to EHMC was 0.39/1.00 and 0.22/1.00, respectively. Addition of EH-O-HSA slightly changed the solubility of DHHB and BMDM. When the weight ratio of EH-O-HSA to EHMC was 0.20/1.00, weight ratio of DHHB and BMDM to EHMC was 0.35/1.00 and 0.25/1.00, respectively at the saturation at 5°C. In the presence of EH-O-HSA, a strong coexistence effect of DHHB and BMDM was found on their solubility. A thermodynamically stable saturated solution at 5°C having the composition that DHHB: BMDM: EHMC: EH-O-HSA = 0.47: 0.46: 1.00: 0.20 was obtained by the simultaneous addition of solid DHHB and BMDM into the initial solution. CONCLUSION: The solution type composite having the highest concentrations of DHHB and BMDM prepared in this study exhibited critical wavelength at 368 nm that was just below the border for sunscreens being qualified as 'Broad Spectrum' protection under the new rule launched by US FDA.

"Abstract: Skin infections represent an important public health issue and cost-driver. Additionally, chronic skin lesions are sometimes colonized by Gram-negative species. Topical therapies are a key component in the management of mild-to-moderate skin infections. In such cases, topical antibiotics may be preferable to systemic treatment, since they maximize the effective doses at the site of infection while minimizing the systemic side effects of the drugs. However, the prevalence of resistant strains is steadily increasing and cases of sensitization are not uncommon. As a consequence, the ideal topical antibiotic should be selective (thus, minimizing cross-resistance), have weak sensitization potential, penetrate the skin efficiently, reach adequate local doses at the site of infection, and finally be available in different formulations matching patients' preferences and needs. Fusidic acid (FA) is a selective antibiotic available in several topical formulations. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have shown that, contrary to other topical antibiotics such as gentamicin or mupirocin, FA reaches high antimicrobial concentration at deep skin layers after topical application either on intact or damaged epidermis. Several randomized controlled trials demonstrated that FA, in its various topical formulations, is very effective in treating skin infections, given its high bactericidal activity against S. aureus (including strains resistant to penicillin, methicillin, ampicillin, cloxacillin), S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Corinebatteria, Clostridia. Additionally, FA presents a low risk of resistance even in methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, a common pathogen implied in the etiology of skin infections and infected atopic eczema. Such feature makes FA particularly useful in the management of these medical conditions. Finally, possibly due to its large steric effect, FA has proved a very low risk of contact sensitization. Overall, data on FA efficacy, safety, sensitization potential, resistance profile and spectrum selectivity make it a first-choice option in the treatment of primary and secondary skin infection. "
"BACKGROUND: We characterize a novel nanocomposite that acts as an efficient anticancer agent. METHODS: This nanocomposite consists of zinc layered hydroxide intercalated with protocatechuate (an anionic form of protocatechuic acid), that has been synthesized using a direct method with zinc oxide and protocatechuic acid as precursors. RESULTS: The resulting protocatechuic acid nanocomposite (PAN) showed a basal spacing of 12.7 Å, indicating that protocatechuate was intercalated in a monolayer arrangement, with an angle of 54° from the Z-axis between the interlayers of the zinc layered hydroxide, and an estimated drug loading of about 35.7%. PAN exhibited the properties of a mesoporous type material, with greatly enhanced thermal stability of protocatechuate as compared to its free counterpart. The presence of protocatechuate in the interlayers of the zinc layered hydroxide was further supported by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Protocatechuate was released from PAN in a slow and sustained manner. This mechanism of release was well represented by a pseudo-second order kinetics model. PAN has shown increased cytotoxicity compared to the free form of protocatechuic acid in all cancer cell lines tested. Tumor growth suppression was extensive, particularly in HepG2 and HT29 cell lines. CONCLUSION: PAN is suitable for use as a controlled release formulation, and our in vitro evidence indicates that PAN is an effective anticancer agent. PAN may have potential as a chemotherapeutic drug for human cancer. "
"Abstract: The aim of this work was to study the effect of the sex and the smoking status on the pharmacokinetics and the bioequivalence assessment of a branded and a generic cyclosporine A microemulsion formulation in soft-gelatin capsule. Sixteen healthy volunteers (eight women and eight men) participated in a CyA bioequivalence study, with nine of the volunteers being smokers. Sandimmun Neoral® (brand formulation; Reference) and Sigmasporin Microral® (generic formulation; Test) were administered under fasting conditions. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated through non compartmental analysis. Bioequivalence was declared based on the 90% confidence intervals (90% CI) for the T/R ratio of the geometric means for each parameter. In vitro determination of the capsules opening time was performed in simulated gastric fluid without enzyme with USP Apparatus 2. The extent of absorption was similar between both products for all subjects or each sex-group. The absorption rate was similar for both products when considering all subjects, whereas a significant difference in the TMAX between the two products was observed for the male subjects only, which relates to its slower capsule opening time observed in vitro (12.4 versus 6.0 min). No differences were observed in women that could relate to their slower gastric emptying. Differences in drug exposure were observed between smokers and non-smokers. Sex- and smoke-related differences in the gastrointestinal transit should be considered when the on-set time would be determinant for the treatment success of a drug. "
"Abstract: Zinc oxide nano-particles (ZnO NPs), with their unique physico-chemical properties conferred by various size formulations, are extensively used in consumer products. The enormous usage coupled with their release to the environment demands risk assessment of ZnO NPs on health and the environment. Toxicity of ZnO NPs is well understood in comparison to the bulk ZnO. However, toxicity in relation to the NP size is poorly understood. In this context, we examined the adverse effects of different sizes (35 nm, 50 nm and 100 nm) of ZnO NPs in soil nematode C. elegans along with bulk ZnO and ZnCl2. Here, we show that growth, reproduction and behavior of worms were adversely affected by ZnO NPs in a size dependent manner. Further, exposure to ZnO NPs caused modulation of expression/function of genes associated with Insulin/IGF-like signaling pathway and/or stress response pathway in a size dependent manner in exposed worms. The expression of pro-apoptotic gene and suppression of anti-apoptotic genes, together with increased numbers of cell corpses in the germ line, indicated that apoptosis was also dependent on the size of the ZnO NP. Taken together, our study provides evidence that exposure to ZnO NPs disrupts various physiological processes and causes apoptosis in the germ-line even at very low concentration in a size dependent manner. Our finding suggests the inclusion of size as an additional measure for the cautious monitoring of ZnO NP disposal into the environment. "
"Abstract: Tuberculosis is a lethal epidemic, difficult to control disease, claiming thousands of lives every year. We have developed a nanodelivery formulation based on para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) and zinc layered hydroxide using zinc nitrate salt as a precursor. The developed formulation has a fourfold higher efficacy of PAS against mycobacterium tuberculosis with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) found to be at 1.40 μg/mL compared to the free drug PAS with a MIC of 5.0 μg/mL. The newly developed formulation was also found active against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and Candida albicans. The formulation was also found to be biocompatible with human normal lung cells MRC-5 and mouse fibroblast cells-3T3. The in vitro release of PAS from the formulation was found to be sustained in a human body simulated phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution at pH values of 7.4 and 4.8. Most importantly the nanocomposite prepared using zinc nitrate salt was advantageous in terms of yield and free from toxic zinc oxide contamination and had higher biocompatibility compared to one prepared using a zinc oxide precursor. In summary, these promising in vitro results are highly encouraging for the continued investigation of para-aminosalicylic acid and zinc layered hydroxide nanocomposites in vivo and eventual preclinical studies.

"Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is regarded as a treatment option for basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of methylene blue (MB)-based PDT in patients suffering from nodular or ulcerative BCCs. This study is a prospective clinical trial with a 6-months follow-up. The study setting is at the Dermatology Clinic at NILES, Cairo University, Egypt. Seventeen patients complaining of nodular BCC (nBCC) and three patients complaining of ulcerative BCC (uBCC) were taken as samples. Methylene blue, the photosensitizer, was prepared in two different formulas: liposomal-loaded MB (LMB) was prepared and formulated in hydrogel (MB 0.2%) to be used topically alone for treating BCCs <2 cm in diameter or to be combined with intralesional injection (ILI) of free MB 2% aqueous solution for treating BCCs ≥2 cm in diameter. A session was performed every 2 weeks until complete response (CR) of the lesion or for a maximum of six sessions. Clinical assessments of clinical improvement, dermatological photography, monthly follow-up visits for 6 months, and skin biopsy after 3 months of follow-up to confirm the response, recurrence, or both in cases in which the clinical evaluation was ambiguous. Seventeen patients of the 20 completed the study, 11 patients achieved CR with very good cosmetic outcome, photosensitizer tolerance, and minimal reported side effects. MB is a cheap promising alternative photosensitizer for PDT of nBCC. "
"Abstract: Salient features such as controlled release, target ability, potential of penetration, improved physical stability, low cost compared to phospholipids, and ease of scaling-up makes solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) a viable alternative to liposomes for effective drug delivery. Adapalene (ADA) is a second generation retinoid effective in treating various dermatologic disorders such as Acne vulgaris with a few noticeable dose-mediated side effects. The present study was aimed at developing and characterizing ADA loaded SLNs for effective topical delivery. The formulated SLN system was characterized for particle size, poly dispersity index, entrapment efficiency and drug release properties. The resultant formulation (ADA loaded SLNs incorporated into carbopol hydrogel) was evaluated for in vitro drug release, skin permeation and bio-distribution, rheological behaviour, and texture profile analysis. The SLNs based ADA gel has shown its potential in targeting skin epidermal layer, and reducing systemic penetration. The developed system can avoid systemic uptake of ADA in skin layers, and can localize drug in skin epidermis as confirmed by rat skin model. Our results advocate potential of SLNs as a novel carrier for topical delivery of ADA in topical therapeutic approaches. This study open new avenues for drug delivery which better meets the need of anti-acne research. "
"Abstract: Topical corticosteroids (TCSs) are a major part of the foundation of treatment for a wide variety of eczematous and inflammatory skin disorders in both adults and children. Mid-potency TCSs represent an important category as they are often used to treat eczematous dermatoses, such as atopic dermatitis. The TCS product must effectively release the active ingredient and promote cutaneous penetration so that therapeutic activity can occur. As many topical products eventually become available as generic formulations, it is important to recognize that although the active ingredient and its concentration are the same, the vehicle excipients may differ significantly, occasionally leading to potential differences in irritancy, in allergenicity, in effects on epidermal permeability barrier function, and, possibly, in efficacy. Clocortolone pivalate 0.1% cream is a mid-potency TCS formulated in an emollient formulation that has been shown to be effective and well-tolerated in the management of several corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. This article outlines the pharmacologic and clinical data achieved with the original brand formulation of clocortolone pivalate 0.1% cream, and discusses the establishment of an authorized generic formulation that is identical in formulation to the original brand.

"AIMS: The examination of cough reflex sensitivity through inhalational challenge can be utilized to demonstrate pharmacological end points. Here we compare the effect of butamirate, dextromethorphan and placebo on capsaicin-induced cough in healthy volunteers. METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, six way crossover study the effect of dextromethrophan 30 mg, four doses of butamirate and placebo was evaluated on incremental capsaicin challenges performed at baseline and 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h following dosing. The primary end point was the area under the curve (AUC(0,12h)) of log10 C5 from pre-dose to 12 h after dosing. Plasma butamirate metabolites were analyzed to evaluate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships. RESULTS: Thirty-four subjects (13 males, median age 25 years) completed the study. Cough sensitivity decreased from baseline in all arms of the study. Dextromethorphan was superior to placebo (P = 0.01) but butamirate failed to show significant activity with maximum attenuation at the 45 mg dose. There was no apparent relationship between pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters for butamirate. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated for the first time that dextromethorphan attenuates capsaicin challenge confirming its broad activity on the cough reflex. The lack of efficacy of butamirate could be due to formulation issues at higher doses. "
"Abstract: Development of orally available phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitors as anti-inflammatory drugs has been going on for decades. However, only roflumilast has received FDA approval. One key challenge has been the low therapeutic window observed in the clinic for PDE4 inhibitors, primarily due to PDE4 mediated side effects. Here we describe our approach to circumvent this issue by applying a soft-drug concept in the design of a topically acting PDE4 inhibitor for treatment of dermatological diseases. We used a fast follower approach, starting from piclamilast. In particular, simultaneous introduction of 2'-alkoxy substituents and changing an amide to a keto linker proved to be beneficial when designing potential soft-drug candidates. This effort culminated in identification of LEO 29102 (20), a potent, selective, and soft-drug PDE4 inhibitor with properties suitable for patient-friendly formulations giving efficient drug delivery to the skin. Compound 20 has reached phase 2 and demonstrated clinically relevant efficacy in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. "
"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of inhaled GSK961081 and fluticasone propionate (FP) given alone, concurrently and as a combination blend formulation. METHODS: The study was double-blind, double-dummy, four-way crossover. Twenty-four healthy volunteers took single doses of the following in randomized order: (1) GSK961081 800 µg; (2) FP 500 µg; (3) GSK961081 800 µg and FP 500 µg as a blend formulation; and (4) GSK961081 800 µg and FP 500 µg concurrently via separate inhalers. The eLung breathing simulator was also used for the in vitro characterization of the formulations. RESULTS: There was no pharmacokinetic interaction when GSK961081 and FP were administered concurrently. Mean Cmax and AUC(0-t) of GSK961081 were lower (∼20%) and mean Cmax and AUC(0-t) of FP were higher (two fold) following GSK961081/FP blend formulation compared to concurrent or the individual components alone. There was an increase in the FP in vitro ex-throat dose for the GSK961081/FP blend from the eLung breathing simulator. Serum cortisol suppression was greater with GSK961081/FP blend, with lower (∼10%) cortisol levels than after GSK961081 + FP concurrent or FP alone. CONCLUSION: GSK961081/FP blend formulation was associated with an increase in FP systemic exposure and greater serum cortisol suppression. "
"Abstract: The oxidizing capacity and skin penetration of a commercial nanosized ZnO, Nanosun™ (Micronisers-Australia), were evaluated in vitro using porcine skin. Nanosun™ was initially characterized regarding its photo-reactivity and size distribution. An assay using methylene blue was performed to confirm the Nanosun™ photo-reactivity by exposing the labile molecule to UVA irradiation in the presence and absence of the nanosized ZnO. The nanosized ZnO was photo-reactive, reducing the methylene blue concentration to 7% while its concentration remained constant in the control formulation (without ZnO). The product label states that the average particle size is 30 nm. X-ray diffraction, nitrogen sorption and UV-spectrophotometry confirmed the presence of nanometric particles of approximately 30 nm. On the other hand, laser diffractometry showed micrometric particles in the size distribution profile. These analyses indicated that the nanoparticles are arranged as agglomerates and aggregates of micrometric proportions ranging from 0.6 to 60 μm. The skin lipid peroxidation was determined by the formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) and quantified by UV-spectrophotometry. When exposed to UVA radiation the nanosized ZnO applied porcine skin showed a lower production of TBARS (7.2 ± 1.5 nmol g(-1)) than the controls, the MCT applied porcine skin (18.4 ± 2.8 nmol g(-1)) and the blank porcine skin (14.0 ± 2.0 nmol g(-1)). The penetration of ZnO nanoparticles was studied by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The tested ZnO particles did not penetrate into viable layers of the intact porcine skin. The particles tend to accumulate on the skin folds and in these regions they may penetrate into the horny layer. "
"Abstract: Flavonoids, which are ubiquitously present in the plant kingdom, preserve food and beverages at the parts per million level with minor perturbation of sensory impressions. Additionally, they are safe and possibly contribute positive health effects. Flavonoids should be further exploited for the protection of food and beverages against light-induced quality deterioration through: (1) direct absorption of photons as inner filters protecting sensitive food components; (2) deactivation of (triplet-)excited states of sensitisers like chlorophyll and riboflavin; (3) quenching of singlet oxygen from type II photosensitisation; and (iv) scavenging of radicals formed as reaction intermediates in type I photosensitisation. For absorption of light, combinations of flavonoids, as found in natural co-pigmentation, facilitate dissipation of photon energy to heat thus averting photodegradation. For protection against singlet oxygen and triplet sensitisers, chemical quenching gradually decreases efficiency hence the pathway to physical quenching should be optimised through product formulation. The feasibility of these protection strategies is further supported by kinetic data that are becoming available, allowing for calculation of threshold levels of flavonoids to prevent beer and dairy products from going off. On the other hand, increasing understanding of the interplay between light and matrix physicochemistry, for example the effect of aprotic microenvironments on phototautomerisation of compounds like quercetin, opens up for engineering better light-to-heat converting channels in processed food to eventually prevent quality loss.

"Abstract: Neurogenic pain and pruritus are the common chief complaints at dermatology office visits. Unfortunately, they are also notoriously difficult conditions to treat. Topical capsaicin used as a single therapy or as an adjuvant offers a low-risk option for patients who do not achieve control on other therapies. This chapter presents the evidence behind topical capsaicin use in dermatologic conditions characterized by neurogenic pain or pruritus, including postherpetic neuralgia, notalgia paresthetica, brachioradial pruritus, lichen simplex chronicus, prurigo nodularis, pruritus ani, pruritus of hemodialysis, aquagenic pruritus, apocrine chromhidrosis, lipodermatosclerosis, alopecia areata, and psoriasis. It presents the most common capsaicin formulations, dosages, and durations of treatment for each condition. Additionally, the chapter addresses various adverse effects and limitations in the use of topical capsaicin in dermatology. "
"UNLABELLED: Capsaicin appears to be effective for osteoarthritis pain but it is uncertain whether the effect has a dose response, is consistent across joints, or changes over time. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials of topical capsaicin use in OA were identified from PubMed, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Knowledge. Effect on pain scores, patient global evaluation of treatment effectiveness and application site burning were assessed by standardised mean differences (SMD), using RevMan. RESULTS: Five double-blind randomized controlled trials and one case-crossover trial of topical capsaicin use were identified. Formulations ranged from 0.025 to 0.075%, and trial durations from 4 to 12 weeks. Trials assessed OA of the knee (n = 3), hand (n = 1), and a mix of joints (n = 2). Capsaicin treatment efficacy (vs. placebo) for change in VAS pain score was moderate, at 0.44 (95% CI 0.25-0.62) over 4 weeks of treatment. There was no heterogeneity between studies, indicating no between-study differences, including effect of OA site or treatment concentration. Two studies reported treatment beyond 4 weeks, with divergent results. One study reported an effect size of -9 mm after 12 weeks, and maximal between-group differences at 4 weeks. A second study reported that between-group differences increased over time, up to 20 weeks. Capsaicin was reported as being safe and well-tolerated, with no systemic toxicity. Mild application site burning affected 35-100% of capsaicin-treated patients with a risk ratio of 4.22 (95% CI 3.25-5.48, n = 5 trials); incidence peaked in week 1, with incidence rates declining over time. CONCLUSIONS: Topical capsaicin treatment four times daily is moderately effective in reducing pain intensity up to 20 weeks regardless of site of application and dose in patients with at least moderate pain and clinical or radiologically defined OA, and is well tolerated.

"Abstract: This chapter reviews the scientific and clinical evidence supporting the use of topical formulations containing the pungent principle of chili peppers--capsaicin, for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. Given the limitations of current oral and parenteral therapies for the management of pain arising from various forms of nerve injury, alternate therapeutic approaches that are not associated with systemic adverse events that limit quality of life, impair function, or threaten respiratory depression are critically needed. Moreover, neuropathic conditions can be complicated by progressive changes in the central and peripheral nervous system, leading to persistent reorganization of pain pathways and chronic neuropathic pain. Recent advances in the use of high-dose topical capsaicin preparations hold promise in managing a wide range of painful conditions associated with peripheral neuropathies and may in fact help reduce suffering by reversing progressive changes in the nervous system associated with chronic neuropathic pain conditions.

"BACKGROUND: Isotretinoin-Lidose, the first new formulation of isotretinoin in 30 years, differs from previously approved isotretinoin formulations in that it is less dependent on the presence of fat in the gut for absorption. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the safety profiles of isotretinoin-Lidose and food-dependent generic isotretinoin in the largest clinical study with isotretinoin-925 randomized patients from 49 study sites. Determine if the efficacy of this new formulation is noninferior to an existing isotretinoin. METHODS: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, noninferiority trial. Study medication was taken with meals twice daily for 20 weeks. Patients were followed for 4 weeks after the last dose. Safety evaluations included recordings of adverse events, assessments for depression, anxiety, emergent psychotic symptoms, and suicidal ideation/behavior, as well as DEXA and X-ray evaluations and changes in bone age. Two co-primary efficacy outcomes were measured to assess noninferiority: a) change in total nodular facial and truncal lesion count at from baseline to week 20 and b) percentage of patients who experienced at least 90% reduction in nodular facial and truncal lesion count from baseline to week 20. LIMITATIONS: Although isotretinoin-Lidose can be taken without meals, it was given with food because the absorption of both formulations in the study had to be similar to detect noninferiority. RESULTS: The safety profile of the 2 formulations was comparable. Criteria for noninferiority for both co-primary efficacy outcomes were met based on predetermined margins. CONCLUSION: Safety and efficacy of isotretinoin-Lidose is similar and noninferior to food-dependent generic isotretinoin, respectively. "
"BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with intense pulsed light (IPL) was proven effective for photorejuvenation. Recently, a new formulation of 0.5% 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) liposomal spray has been available. We designed a randomized split face study to evaluate usefulness and safety of IPL-PDT using a liposomal spray for periorbital wrinkles in Asians. METHODS: Patients received three treatments every 3 weeks. The half of the face was treated with IPL-PDT and the other half with long pulsed Nd:YAG laser (LPNY). Skin fluorescence was measured using a spectrophotometer for the guidance of PDT treatment. Wrinkle score was marked by two-blinded independent dermatologists. RESULTS: One patient dropped out due to 3-d lasting erythema on PDT side. The difference of mean reduction in lower and lateral periorbital wrinkle score on PDT side between the first and the last visit was statistically significant (p = 0.008 and p = 0.001, respectively). Lateral periorbital wrinkles treated with PDT showed better results than LPNY-treated sides. Twenty-five percent of patients reported good to excellent outcomes. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that PDT with a liposomal spray provided modest wrinkle reduction without serious adverse effect and it might be a promising treatment modality for wrinkle treatment in Asians.

"Abstract: Hyaluronic acid (HA)-based injectable fillers three-dimensionally restore the natural contours of the lips and perioral area, thereby reducing some signs of aging lips. To evaluate the short-term aesthetic impact of treatment with the HA dermal filler Juvéderm(®) VOLBELLA(®) with Lidocaine, formulated utilizing VYCROSS(™) technology, for enhancement or correction of asymmetry of the lips, evaluated using a patient-centric approach. Sixty-two subjects were enrolled in this study, conducted at two sites in Germany. Primary endpoints were satisfaction with improvement, look and feel of the lips, assessed by subject and physician at first visit and 4 weeks post-treatment. Immediately after injection at first visit, 83.6% of subjects were Extremely Satisfied, Very Satisfied or Satisfied with improvement in the lips, which increased to 94.1% and 93.0% of subjects with/without top-up treatment at follow-up, respectively. After injection at first visit, 61.7% of subjects rated the look and feel of their lips as Extremely Natural or Very Natural, which increased to 75.0% and 93.0% of subjects with/without top-up treatment, respectively. The HA dermal filler was associated with minimal discomfort, bruising or swelling of the lips; almost two-thirds of subjects (62%) returned to social engagements on the same day. The high degree of subject satisfaction with aesthetic improvement in the lips, as well as the natural look and feel, indicates that this HA dermal filler represents an effective treatment option for patients requiring lip enhancement.

"Abstract: Three different ZnO-based antibacterial fillers having different morphologies in microscale region were prepared by the use of the microwave assisted synthesis protocol created in our laboratory with additional annealing in one case. Further, PVC composites containing 0.5-5 wt.% of ZnO based antibacterial fillers were prepared by melt mixing and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). Mechanical testing showed no adverse effect on the working of polymer composites due to either of the fillers used or the applied processing conditions in comparison with the neat medical grade PVC. The surface antibacterial activity of the compounded PVC composites was assessed against Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538P according to ISO 22196: 2007 (E). All materials at almost all filler loading levels were efficient against both species of bacteria. The material with the most expanding morphology assuring the largest contact between filler and matrix achieved an excellent level of more than 99.9999% reduction of viable cells of E. coli in comparison to untreated PVC and performed very well against S. aureus, too. A correlation between the morphology and efficacy of the filler was observed and, as a result, a general rule was formulated which links the proneness of the microparticles to perform well against bacteria to their shape and morphology.

"Abstract: Recent reports have indicated that psoriasis may be caused by malfunctioning dermal immune cells, and psoralen ultraviolet A (PUVA) is an effective treatment for this chronic disease. However, conventional topical formulations achieve poor drug delivery across patches of psoriasis to their target sites. The present study describes the development of a novel psoralen transdermal delivery system employing ethosomes, flexible vesicles that can penetrate the stratum corneum and target deep skin layers. An in vitro skin permeation study showed that the permeability of psoralen-loaded ethosomes was superior to that of liposomes. Using ethosomes, psoralen transdermal flux and skin deposition were 38.89±0.32 μg/cm(2)/h and 3.87±1.74 μg/cm(2), respectively, 3.50 and 2.15 times those achieved using liposomes, respectively. The ethosomes and liposomes were found to be safe following daily application to rat skin in vivo, for 7 days. The ethosomes showed better biocompatibility with human embryonic skin fibroblasts than did an equivalent ethanol solution, indicating that the phosphatidylcholine present in ethosome vesicles improved their biocompatibility. These findings indicated that ethosomes could potentially improve the dermal and transdermal delivery of psoralen and possibly of other drugs requiring deep skin delivery. "
"BACKGROUND: Use of hormone therapy for menopausal complaints is a subject of controversy and increased uncertainty and concerns. This non-interventional study aimed to investigate a marketed oral formulation containing 1 mg estradiol and 0.04 mg levonorgestrel for continuous treatment of menopausal symptoms for approximately 6 months in women visiting gynecological practices in Germany. METHODS: Changes in the menopause rating scale (MRS) total and sub-domain scores after three and six 28-d cycles served as primary endpoint. Skin- and hair-related complaints, quality of sexual life and subjective satisfaction with the treatment were assessed. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs), adverse events (AEs) and vaginal bleeding were evaluated. RESULTS: MRS scores improved significantly above 5 points of clinical relevance as compared to baseline (n = 736, p < 0.0001). Skin- and hair-related symptoms abated; quality of sexual life improved. AEs were registered in 9.9% of the participants. No unexpected ADRs were reported. Bleeding episodes consistently decreased; >75% of the subjects were amenorrheic throughout the study. Medication's effectiveness and tolerability was rated very good/good by >80% of the participants, who also continued treatment. CONCLUSION: This estradiol/low-dose levonorgestrel formulation safely alleviates menopausal symptoms in peri- and postmenopausal women with add-on benefits regarding dermatological and sexual life complaints.

"Abstract: Mustard gas is a simple molecule with a deadly past. First used as a chemical weapon in World War I, its simple formulation has raised concerns over its use by terrorist organizations and unstable governments. Mustard gas is a powerful vesicant and alkylating agent that causes painful blisters on epithelial surfaces and increases the incidence of cancer in those exposed. The mechanism of mustard gas toxicity and tumorigenesis is not well understood but is thought to be mediated by its ability to induce oxidative stress and DNA damage. Interestingly, several proteins that have been shown to either be targets of mustard gas or mediate mustard gas toxicity have also been shown to regulate centrosome duplication. Centrosomes are small nonmembrane-bound organelles that direct the segregation of chromosomes during mitosis through the formation of the bipolar mitotic spindle. Cells with more or less than two centrosomes during mitosis can segregate their chromosomes unequally, resulting in chromosome instability, a common phenotype of cancer cells. In our studies, we show that subtoxic levels of 2-chloroethyl ethylsulfide (2-CEES), a mustard gas analog, induce centrosome amplification and chromosome instability in cells, which may hasten the mutation rate necessary for tumorigenesis. These data may explain why those exposed to mustard gas exhibit higher incidences of cancer than unexposed individuals of the same cohort. "
"Abstract: Mometasone furoate as a nasal spray is an effective treatment for seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). An aqueous mometasone nasal spray containing the same active substance and excipients as the originator product (reference mometasone) has been developed. This study was designed to establish therapeutic equivalence of test mometasone to reference mometasone and superiority over placebo for the treatment of SAR in adults. In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, fixed-dose study, patients aged ≥18 years with SAR were randomized 2:2:1 to reference mometasone, test mometasone, or placebo for 28 days. Patients recorded nasal and ocular symptoms daily. The primary end point was change from baseline in the pooled 24-hour reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS). Safety and tolerability included evaluation by adverse events (AEs), physical (including nasal) examinations, vital signs assessments, laboratory evaluations, and change in concomitant medications. Four hundred two patients received reference mometasone (n = 156), test mometasone (n = 163), or placebo (n = 83). The intent-to-treat population (ITT) comprised 399 patients, and the per-protocol (PP) population comprised 327 patients. The 95% confidence intervals for the treatment difference (reference minus test mometasone) in change from baseline in pooled 24-hour rTNSS were within prespecified equivalence limits for the PP and ITT populations. Both active treatments showed superiority over placebo (p = 0.0019-0.0087). No significant difference was seen between test mometasone and reference mometasone for any secondary efficacy variables. Treatment-emergent AE incidence was low. No deaths or serious AEs were reported. The test mometasone is efficacious in the treatment of SAR in adults and shows a favorable safety profile. The results indicate that the test mometasone is therapeutically equivalent to the reference mometasone. "
"BACKGROUND: Cyclosporin is a calcineurin inhibitor widely used in renal transplant patients to prevent organ rejection. Several position papers have been published but no reports on the practical experience in pediatric patients undergoing conversion between cyclosporin innovator and generic products are available. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety as part of therapeutic monitoring of cyclosporin in renal transplant pediatric patients who switch from the innovator to the generic formulation in Argentina. SETTING: Hospital de Pediatría JP Garrahan, Buenos Aires, Argentina. METHODS: Stable pediatric renal transplant patients (6 months post-transplant) switched from the innovator to the generic formulation of cyclosporin microemulsion capsule. Cyclosporin pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained while taking the innovator and after starting with the generic formulation. Blood samples were drawn before and 1, 2, and 3 h after drug administration and subsequently quantified. Pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained by means of a Bayesian approach. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURE: Cyclosporin pharmacokinetic parameters (area under the curve, AUC; Blood concentration after 2 h, C2), adverse events and graft rejection. RESULTS: A total of 12 patients were included. Median (range) age and time post-transplant were 10.7 years (6.5-17.7) and 8.3 years (3.4-14.0), respectively. Two patients or their parents did not consent to the switch. Median (range) dose normalized cyclosporin AUC and C2 were 1.15 (mg*h/L)/mg/kg (0.72-3.0) and 265.5 (ng/ml)/mg/kg (120.8-725.7), respectively, on the innovator therapy and 1.05 (mg*h/L)/mg/kg (0.54-2.22) and 317.1 (ng/ml)/mg/kg (116.7-564.7) for the generic drug after the switch. The median (range) percentage of change in the AUC and C2 when switching between formulations were 16.7 % (0.7-56.7) and 13.1 % (3.7-68.6), respectively. No significant changes in serum creatinine levels were registered when comparing before and after substitution of products. Adverse events (number of events) recorded 5 months before and after the switch included hirsutism (2), hypertension (2), and gingival hyperplasia (1). CONCLUSION: Conversion of cyclosporin from innovator brand to generic in pediatric renal transplant patients needs to be closely monitored. "
"BACKGROUND: Treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) with pegylated interferon-alpha/ribavirin is associated with well-characterized dermatological adverse events (AEs), which can lead to premature discontinuation of treatment. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and spectrum of dermatological AEs during CHC treatment with interferon-alpha plus ribavirin and analyzed factors predisposing patients to such reactions. STUDY DESIGN: Between January 2008 and December 2012, 152 CHC patients who had received interferon/pegylated interferon plus ribavirin therapy were enrolled in this retrospective study. To determine which factors were associated with dermatological AE development, a Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: Thirty dermatological AEs were recorded in 28 (18.4%) patients. These reactions included 14 (9.2%) patients with eczematous reactions, four (2.6%) patients with xerosis, three (2.0%) patients with new-onset or exacerbation of psoriasis, two (1.3%) patients with lichenoid eruption, two (1.3%) patients with diffuse folliculitis and one patient with lichen planus, alopecia areata, hypermelanosis, and necrosis of the skin and toenails. Application of the Cox proportional-hazards model revealed that age older than 60 years (HR=1.070; 95% CI: 1.043-1.096), pre-existing anaphylaxis/skin disease (HR=2.612; 95% CI: 1.593-3.324), cirrhosis (HR=1.863; 95% CI: 1.047-3.013), and treatment with pegylated interferon formulations (HR=1.930; 95% CI: 1.052-3.687) were associated with occurrence of dermatologic AEs. Twenty-seven (90%) skin conditions were classified as mild to moderate, while one case (3.3%) warranted premature discontinuation of treatment. CONCLUSION: Dermatological AEs resulting from interferon-alpha/ribavirin treatment of CHC contribute to a wide spectrum involve the skin, mucous membrane, hair, and nails. These dermatological AEs correlated with older age, previous skin condition, cirrhosis, and use of pegylated interferon formulations. "
"Abstract: Accumulating evidence has shown that the Toll-like receptor 7 agonist imiquimod (IMQ) induces psoriasiform skin inflammation in mice and that this inflammation is dependent on the IL-23/IL-17 axis. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the main source of IL-17 is not Th17 but is dermal gamma delta (γδ) T cells in mouse psoriasiform skin. Recent advances in the understanding of immunopathogenesis of psoriasis led to an alteration in the treatment paradigm to the use of highly efficacious biologics. However, their high cost impedes the extensive use of these agents. Thus, inexpensive and safe medications are still considered valuable. In this study, we introduce the therapeutic efficacy of a newly formulated methotrexate (MTX), a chemical conjugate of MTX with cell permeable peptide, for the treatment of psoriasis. Topically applied skin-penetrating (SP)-MTX reduced the psoriasiform skin phenomenon, epidermal thickness and infiltrating immune cells into the dermis. IL-17A-producing dermal γδ T cells in the cellular infiltrate that contribute IL-23/IL-17 axis were well abrogated by SP-MTX. Furthermore, SP-MTX had no toxic effects on liver, kidney or myeloid cells, unlike systemic administration of MTX. In conclusion, topically applied SP-MTX ameliorated psoriasiform skin inflammation in mice with the criteria of clinical phenomenon, histopathology and immunology, without inducing systemic toxic effects. "
"Abstract: Our previous studies and other published reports on the chemical warfare agent sulfur mustard (SM) and its analog 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES) have indicated a role of oxidative stress in skin injuries caused by these vesicating agents. We examined the effects of the catalytic antioxidant AEOL 10150 in the attenuation of CEES-induced toxicity using our established skin injury models (skin epidermal cells and SKH-1 hairless mice) to validate the role of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of mustard vesicating agents. Treatment of mouse epidermal JB6 and human HaCaT cells with AEOL 10150 (50μM) 1h post-CEES exposure resulted in significant (p < 0.05) reversal of CEES-induced decreases in both cell viability and DNA synthesis. Similarly, AEOL 10150 treatment 1h after CEES exposure attenuated CEES-induced DNA damage in these cells. Similar AEOL 10150 treatments also caused significant (p < 0.05) reversal of CEES-induced decreases in cell viability in normal human epidermal keratinocytes. Cytoplasmic and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species measurements showed that AEOL 10150 treatment drastically ameliorated the CEES-induced oxidative stress in both JB6 and HaCaT cells. Based on AEOL 10150 pharmacokinetic studies in SKH-1 mouse skin, mice were treated with a topical formulation plus subcutaneous injection (5mg/kg) of AEOL 10150 1h after CEES (4mg/mouse) exposure and every 4h thereafter for 12h. This AEOL 10150 treatment regimen resulted in over 50% (p < 0.05) reversal of CEES-induced skin bi-fold and epidermal thickness, myeloperoxidase activity, and DNA oxidation in mouse skin. Results from this study demonstrate the potential therapeutic efficacy of AEOL 10150 against CEES-mediated cutaneous lesions, supporting AEOL 10150 as a medical countermeasure against SM-induced skin injuries.

"Abstract: In the present study, terpene composited lipid nanoparticles and lipid nanoparticles were developed and evaluated for dermal delivery of all-trans-retinoic acids (ATRA). Terpene composited lipid nanoparticles and lipid nanoparticles were investigated for size, size distribution, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, photostability, and cytotoxicity. In vitro skin permeation of ATRA lipid formulations were also evaluated. To explore the ability of lipid nanocarriers to target the skin, the distribution of rhodamine B base in the skin was investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The results indicated that the physicochemical characteristics of terpene composited lipid nanoparticles influenced skin permeability. All lipid nanocarriers significantly protected ATRA from photodegradation and were non-toxic to normal human foreskin ﬁbroblast cells in vitro. Solid lipid nanoparticles containing 10% limonene (10% L-SLN) had the highest ATRA skin permeability. Terpene composited SLN and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) showed higher epidermal permeation of rhodamine B across the skin based on CLSM image analysis. Our study suggests that terpene composited SLN and NLC can be potentially used as dermal drug delivery carriers for ATRA. "
"Abstract: Mefenamic acid (MA) is a BCS II class NSAID drug. It is available only in the form of tablets, capsules, and pediatric suspensions. Oral administration of MA is associated with severe gastrointestinal side effects. The aim of this study was to develop a convenient and low-cost transdermal drug delivery system for MA using proniosome as a novel carrier without the addition of penetration enhancers. The formulation factors, such as the presence of cholesterol, types of lecithin, and surfactants were investigated for their influence on the entrapment efficiency, rate of hydration, vesicle size, and zeta potential, in vitro drug release and skin permeation in order to optimize the proniosomal formulations with the minimum dose of the drug. Furthermore, the in vivo anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated on a formalin-induced rat paw edema model. The results showed that the type of surfactants had higher impact on the entrapment efficiency than the type of lecithins, with the highest in Span 80 (82.84%). The release of MA from Span 80 proniosomal gel was significantly affected by the type of lecithin used. The addition of cholesterol significantly increased both the drug release and the skin permeation flux of MA. Zeta potential showed a stable A4 noisomal suspension. DSC revealed the molecular dispersion of MA into the loaded proniosomes. In vivo study of the treatment group with MA proniosome gel showed a significant inhibition of rat paw edema compared with the same gel without the drug (control). The results of this study suggest that proniosomes are promising nano vesicular carriers and safe alternatives to enhance the transdermal delivery of MA. "
"Abstract: Capsaicin (CP), a recent FDA-approved drug for the topical treatment of neuropathic pain, is associated with several side effects like irritation, burning sensation, and erythema, resulting in poor patient compliance. The present study is an attempt to study the effect of CP encasement in nano-lipoidal carriers (NLCs) on skin-transport characteristics, in vivo pharmacological performance, skin compliance, and stability of the finished product. The study also compares two methods of NLC preparation, namely microemulsification and rotary-evaporation for various attributes. The results demonstrated that microemulsion technique produced smaller nanoparticles vis-à-vis the rotary-evaporation method. Out of the various studied solid lipids, NLCs from stearic acid offered smallest size and the highest negative zeta potential. The NLC-gel offered higher skin permeation and skin retention of CP across LACA mice skin as compared with the conventional cream. The analgesic effect was observed to be enhanced substantially than that of the conventional cream when tested on a radiant mouse tail-flick model. The most alarming problems of skin-irritation and redness were successfully taken care by NLC-gel while the mice group receiving conventional cream showed marked changes in the skin histopathology. Besides the enhanced efficacy and decreased skin-irritation, the developed CP-NLCs also found to be stable and rheologically accepted formulation for the treatment of pain-associated disorders. "
"PURPOSE: Solid-lipid microparticles loaded with high amounts of the sunscreen UV filter benzophenone-3 were prepared by spray congealing with the objective of decreasing its skin penetration and evaluate whether the sunscreen's photoprotection were impaired by the microencapsulation process. METHODS: The microparticles were produced using the natural lipids carnauba wax or bees wax and three different concentrations of benzophenone-3 (30, 50 and 70%) using spray congealing technique. RESULTS: The microparticles presented properties suitable for topical application, such as spherical morphology, high encapsulation efficiency (95.53-102.2%), average particle sizes between 28.5 and 60.0 µm with polydispersivities from 1.2 to 2.5. In studies of in vitro skin penetration and preliminary stability, formulations of gel cream containing carnauba wax solid lipid microparticles and 70% benzophenone-3 when compared to the formulation added of bees wax solid-lipid microparticles containing 70% benzophenone-3, was stable considering the several parameters evaluated and were able to decrease the penetration of the UV filter into pig skin. Moreover, the formulations containing solid lipid microparticles with 70% benzophenone-3 increased the photoprotective capacity of benzophenone-3 under UV irradiation. CONCLUSION: The results show that spray-congealed microparticles are interesting solid forms to decrease the penetration solar filters in the skin without compromising their photoprotection. "
"Abstract: Despite recent advances in chemotherapy against acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), the disease still has high mortality, particularly for patients who tolerate extensive chemotherapy poorly. Nano-formulations have potential to minimise the adverse effects of chemotherapy. We present here a liposomal formulation encapsulating both the anthracycline daunorubicin (DNR) and emetine (Eme) for enhanced cytotoxic effect against AML cells. Eme could be loaded into the PEGylated liposomes together with DNR by the acid precipitation principle, with a loading efficiency of Eme at about 50% of that of DNR. The liposome surface was modified with folate to enhance drug loading into cells, giving higher cytotoxic activity. Both intracellular drug loading and cytotoxic activity could be further increased by anti-folate treatment of AML cells with methotrexate (MTX). The combination of DNR and Eme also increased drug loading in MTX-treated cells compared to DNR alone. Liposomes with both DNR and Eme were particularly efficient against AMLs with deficient p53. In conclusion, we have produced a multi-functional liposomal anti-leukaemic drug formulation designed to overcome some of the problems in anthracycline chemotherapy: (1) Combination of DNR and Eme to diminish drug resistance. (2) Using PEGylated stealth liposomes to minimise adverse side-effects. (3) Molecules on the liposomal surface target proteins on AML-cells ensure selectivity, which was enhanced by priming the leukaemia cells with MTX. "
"Abstract: The use of sunscreen is embedded in a hierarchy of sun protection strategies consisting primarily of sun avoidance by seeking shade and covering up with clothing. Sunscreens are, however, important means of protection; thus, understanding how they work and knowing their limitations are crucial. This review explains the role of ultraviolet (UV) filters, emollients, emulsifier systems and other components in a sunscreen, as well as trends in formulations in Europe, North America, Latin America, and Asia Pacific. Furthermore, it explains how sunscreen performance in terms of sun protection factor, UVA protection, and other metrics can be simulated. The role of sensory characteristics in assessing and improving compliance is also discussed.In the final chapter, Facts and Fiction, five of the most common myths about sun exposure and sun protection by sunscreen are debunked.

"OBJECTIVE: To compare the relative bioavailability, safety and tolerability of oral methotrexate (MTX) and subcutaneous (SC) MTX administered via an auto-injector (MTXAI) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: In this randomised, multicenter, open-label, three-way crossover study, patients ≥18 years with adult RA undergoing treatment with MTX for ≥3 months were assigned to receive MTX 10, 15, 20 and 25 mg weekly in a random sequence of three treatments: oral, SC into the abdomen and SC into the thigh. For 24 h after administration of each treatment, blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis and injection sites were assessed. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients completed the study. Systemic exposure of oral MTX plateaued at doses ≥15 mg/week. In contrast, SC MTX demonstrated a linear increase in systemic exposure that was greater than oral MTX at each dose. No unexpected AEs were noted for either formulation. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike oral MTX, the systemic exposure of SC MTX did not plateau over the doses studied, particularly at doses ≥15 mg/week. In this study, higher systemic MTX exposure was not associated with increases in AEs. Patients with an inadequate clinical response to oral MTX may benefit from higher drug exposure by switching to SC MTX. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01618968. "
"Abstract: Surface-active agents (surfactants) form the foundation of an effective detergent formulation. As such, surfactants are a major component of laundry detergents. Depending on multiple factors, the amount of residual detergent surfactants in clothing after washing varies but may be sufficient to elicit skin irritation in susceptible individuals and in patients with existing dermatologic disorders. The goal of this review is to examine the relationship between surfactants commonly used in laundry detergent formulations and their potential for skin irritancy. In this context, the role of surfactants in achieving broad-spectrum cleaning performance in laundry is discussed, and currently available methodologies to evaluate and measure the effect of surfactant exposure on the skin are reviewed.

"Abstract: Topical tretinoin has been a standard treatment for acne vulgaris for more than 4 decades. While tretinoin has demonstrated proven efficacy in the treatment of acne lesions, it also is associated with the potential for skin irritation. Newer formulations have been designed to optimize both the drug concentration and the delivery vehicle with the aim to enable clinicians to provide increasingly effective acne treatment that minimizes irritation. These therapies include formulations with varying concentrations of tretinoin and vehicles that utilize a microsponge delivery system, hydrogels and micronized tretinoin, or propolymers. The purpose of this review is to evaluate different formulations and combinations of tretinoin in the treatment of acne vulgaris. While these advanced formulations were designed for controlled release of active ingredient, and have the potential to reduce cutaneous irritation relative to standard tretinoin cream and gel formulations, there is a need for comparative studies to evaluate the relative benefits of each of these advanced tretinoin formulations in optimizing acne treatment.

"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) abatacept and background methotrexate (MTX) in Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inadequate response to MTX (MTX-IR). METHODS: Double-dummy, double-blind study (NCT01001832); 118 adults with ≥ 10 swollen joints, ≥ 12 tender joints and C-reactive protein (CRP) ≥ 0.8 mg/dL randomized 1:1 to SC abatacept (125 mg weekly) with IV loading (∼10 mg/kg on Day 1), or IV abatacept (∼10 mg/kg monthly) for 169 days, both also receiving MTX (6-8 mg/week). Primary endpoint was Day 169 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20 response; other efficacy endpoints, safety and immunogenicity were assessed. RESULTS: Similar proportions of patients achieved ACR20 responses at Day 169 with SC (91.5% [95% CI 81.3, 97.2]) and IV abatacept (83.1% [71.0, 91.6]). ACR50/70 responses, adjusted mean changes from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index scores and remission rates (28-joint Disease Activity Score [CRP] < 2.6) were also comparable between groups. Serious adverse event frequencies (5.1% vs. 3.4%) were similar with both formulations. One patient per group tested seropositive for immunogenicity. Weekly SC abatacept dosing achieved mean serum concentrations > 10 μg/mL (minimum therapeutic target). CONCLUSIONS: SC abatacept demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety to IV abatacept, with low immunogenicity rates, in MTX-IR Japanese patients with RA. "
"BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/tretinoin 0.025% (Clin-RA) were evaluated in three 12-week randomised studies. OBJECTIVES: To perform a pooled analysis of data from these studies to evaluate Clin-RA's efficacy and safety in a larger overall population, in subgroups of adolescents and according to acne severity. MATERIALS & METHODS: 4550 patients were randomised to Clin-RA, clindamycin, tretinoin and vehicle. Evaluations included percentage change in lesions, treatment success rate, proportions of patients with ≥50% or ≥80% continuous reduction in lesions, adverse events and cutaneous tolerability. RESULTS: In the overall population, the percentage reduction in inflammatory, non-inflammatory and total lesions and the treatment success rate were significantly greater with Clin-RA compared with clindamycin, tretinoin and vehicle alone (all p<0.01). The percentage reduction in all types of lesions was also significantly greater with Clin-RA in the adolescent subgroup (2915 patients, p<0.002) and in patients with mild/moderate acne (3662 patients, p<0.02) versus comparators. In patients with severe acne (n = 880), the percentage reduction in all lesion types was significantly greater with Clin-RA versus vehicle (p<0.0001). A greater proportion of Clin-RA treated patients had a ≥50% or ≥80% continuous reduction in all types of lesions at week 12 compared with clindamycin, tretinoin and vehicle. Adverse event frequencies in the active and vehicle groups were similar. Baseline-adjusted mean tolerability scores over time were <1 (mild) and similar in all groups. CONCLUSION: Clin-RA is safe, has superior efficacy to its component monotherapies and should be considered as one of the first-line therapies for mild-to-moderate facial acne. "
"Abstract: Approximately 95% of the population suffers at some point in their lifetime from acne vulgaris. Acne is a multifactorial disease of the pilosebaceous unit. This inflammatory skin disorder is most common in adolescents but also affects neonates, prepubescent children, and adults. Topical conventional systems are associated with various side effects. Novel drug delivery systems have been used to reduce the side effect of drugs commonly used in the topical treatment of acne. Topical treatment of acne with active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) makes direct contact with the target site before entering the systemic circulation which reduces the systemic side effect of the parenteral or oral administration of drug. The objective of the present review is to discuss the conventional delivery systems available for acne, their drawbacks, and limitations. The advantages, disadvantages, and outcome of using various carrier-based delivery systems like liposomes, niosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and so forth, are explained. This paper emphasizes approaches to overcome the drawbacks and limitations associated with the conventional system and the advances and application that are poised to further enhance the efficacy of topical acne formulations, offering the possibility of simplified dosing regimen that may improve treatment outcomes using novel delivery system.

"Abstract: Our increased knowledge of normal skin physiology has ushered in a subtle revolution in cosmetic science. Originally designed as preparations to enhance personal appearance by direct application on to the skin, cosmetics have now taken on a new role in dermatology, through the support of the management of many skin disorders. This evolving role of cosmetics in skin care is primarily due to scientific and technological advancements that have changed our understanding of normal skin physiology and how cosmetics modify its appearance both physically and biologically. The vast array of techniques currently available to investigate skin responsivity to multiple stimuli has brought about a new era in cosmetic and dermocosmetic development based on a robust understanding of skin physiology and its varied responses to commonly encountered environmental insults. Most cosmetic research is undertaken on reconstructed skin models crucial in dermatological research, given the strict ban imposed by the European Union on animal testing. In addition, the design and conduct of trials evaluating cosmetics now follow rules comparable to those used in the development and evaluation of pharmaceutical products. Cosmetic research should now aim to ensure all trials adhere to strictly reproducible and scientifically sound methodologies. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the multidisciplinary scientific approach used in formulating dermocosmetics, and to examine the major advances in dermocosmetic development and assessment, the safety and regulatory guidelines governing their production and the exciting future outlook for these dermocosmetic processes following good practice rules.

"Abstract: Tretinoin (TRT) is a widely used retinoid for the topical treatment of acne, photo-aged skin, psoriasis and skin cancer which makes it a good candidate for topical formulation. Yet side effects, like redness, swelling, peeling, blistering and, erythema, in addition to its high lipophilicity make this challenging. Therefore, the aim of this study was the development of TRT-loaded proniosomes to improve the drug efficacy and to increase user acceptability and compliance by reducing its side effects. Nine formulae were prepared according to 3(2) factorial design and were evaluated for their morphology, vesicle size, entrapment efficiency (EE %), and% of drug released after 5 h. Hydrogel of the candidate formula, N8G (proniosomes prepared with 0.025% TRT, and Span60: cholesterol molar ratio of 3:1 and incorporated in 1% carbopol gel) was developed and evaluated for skin irritation test and clinical study in acne patients compared to marketed product. Candidate formula showed higher efficacy and very low irritation potential when compared to marketed product in human volunteers. "
"Abstract: One of the current concerns with the application of nanoparticles in sunscreens, and in particular nano-TiO2 and ZnO, is their potential to photogenerate free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) when they absorb ultraviolet wavelengths from sunlight. Free radicals and ROS are known to be associated with UV-induced skin damage and oxidative stress, from which sunscreens are expected to offer significant protection. Here we describe a simple method, based on chemiluminescence emission, for detecting free radicals generated in commercial sunscreens alone, and when applied to various substrates, following exposure to UVA (320-400nm) radiation. This photo-induced chemiluminescence (PICL) technique could be used to optimise sunscreen formulations so as to minimise free radical photogeneration during exposure to sunlight. "
"Abstract: Alopecia is a dermatological disorder, commonly known as hair loss, which affects up to half of the Caucasian male population by middle age, and almost all (95%) Caucasian men by old age. Considering that alopecia affects so many people and that there is currently no scientifically proven treatment with few side effects, new drug-delivery systems able to improve alopecia therapy are urgently required. With this purpose in mind, the present study aimed to develop lipid nanoparticles (nanostructured lipid carriers) with the ability to incorporate and deliver anti-alopecia active compounds (minoxidil and finasteride) into the dermis and hair follicles. Lipid nanoparticles, prepared by ultrasonication method, showed mean particle sizes around 200 nm, which is sufficient for reaching the dermis and hair follicles, and zeta potential values around -30 mV, which indicates good physical stability. Over 28 days of storage, no significant variations in these parameters were observed, which indicates that all nanoformulations are stable in storage over that period. Cryo-scanning electron microscope measurements showed that all the lipid nanoparticles exhibited a spherical shape and a smooth surface regardless of their composition. Differential scanning calorimetry studies allowed the determination of phase transition temperatures and confirmed the recrystallization of the lipid nanoparticles (recrystallization index between 11% and 86%). A high loading efficiency was achieved for finasteride (between 70% and 90%), while less than 30% was achieved for minoxidil nanoparticles, over 28 days. Controlled release assays in physiological conditions demonstrated that nanoparticles loaded with minoxidil yielded a prolonged release, as desired. Penetration assays through pig ear skin demonstrated that nanoparticles loaded with minoxidil and finasteride had low levels of penetration. These results suggest that the proposed novel formulation presents several good characteristics indicating their suitability for dermal delivery of anti-alopecia active compounds. "
"BACKGROUND: 5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a natural heme precursor metabolized into protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). PpIX preferentially accumulates in tumor cells resulting in the formation of singlet oxygen upon exposure to visible light. Doxil(®), an active agent against breast and ovarian cancer, is a nano-formulation of doxorubicin. This study aimed to investigate in vitro synergistic cytotoxic effect of low doses of combined chemotherapy and ALA/PDT to human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7) compared to high doses of each individual therapy. METHODS: MCF-7 cells were pretreated with Doxil(®) (48 h) followed by ALA/PDT (4h). The cell viability was evaluated by trypan blue assay and PpIX production was measured spectrofluorometrically. Alkaline phosphatase was determined as a marker for cellular differentiation. Apoptosis and necrosis were evaluated by fluorescence stains. The apoptosis cell death pathways were investigated: detection of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and percent of DNA fragmentation, malondialdehyde, histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, caspase-3 and death receptors (DR4 and DR5). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was determined by ELISA, as an angiogenic mediator. RESULTS: There was a higher reduction in cell viability in Doxil(®)+ALA/PDT-treated cells compared with their individual effect. The combined therapy showed enhanced apoptosis with a significant increase in the loss of ΔΨm, DNA fragmentation %, caspase-3, DR4, DR5 and lipid peroxides and inhibited HDAC. Pretreatment with Doxil(®) resulted in a twofold increase in the intracellular PpIX, by increasing the PDT killing of MCF-7 cells. CONCLUSION: The combined therapy using 50% of IC50 of ALA/PDT and Doxil(®) possessed a synergistic apoptotic effect on MCF-7 cells compared to 100% of IC50 of each therapy through enhancing both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways, thus may minimize side effects of Doxil(®) and ALA.

"BACKGROUND: Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are anti-inflammatory drugs that have proven benefits for people with worsening symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and repeated exacerbations. They are commonly used as combination inhalers with long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) to reduce exacerbation rates and all-cause mortality, and to improve lung function and quality of life. The most common combinations of ICS and LABA used in combination inhalers are fluticasone and salmeterol, budesonide and formoterol and a new formulation of fluticasone in combination with vilanterol, which is now available. ICS have been associated with increased risk of pneumonia, but the magnitude of risk and how this compares with different ICS remain unclear. Recent reviews conducted to address their safety have not compared the relative safety of these two drugs when used alone or in combination with LABA. OBJECTIVES: To assess the risk of pneumonia associated with the use of fluticasone and budesonide for COPD. SEARCH METHODS: We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR), clinicaltrials.gov, reference lists of existing systematic reviews and manufacturer websites. The most recent searches were conducted in September 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included parallel-group randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 12 weeks' duration. Studies were included if they compared the ICS budesonide or fluticasone versus placebo, or either ICS in combination with a LABA versus the same LABA as monotherapy for people with COPD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted study characteristics, numerical data and risk of bias information for each included study.We looked at direct comparisons of ICS versus placebo separately from comparisons of ICS/LABA versus LABA for all outcomes, and we combined these with subgroups when no important heterogeneity was noted. After assessing for transitivity, we conducted an indirect comparison to compare budesonide versus fluticasone monotherapy, but we could not do the same for the combination therapies because of systematic differences between the budesonide and fluticasone combination data sets.When appropriate, we explored the effects of ICS dose, duration of ICS therapy and baseline severity on the primary outcome. Findings of all outcomes are presented in 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADEPro. MAIN RESULTS: We found 43 studies that met the inclusion criteria, and more evidence was provided for fluticasone (26 studies; n = 21,247) than for budesonide (17 studies; n = 10,150). Evidence from the budesonide studies was more inconsistent and less precise, and the studies were shorter. The populations within studies were more often male with a mean age of around 63, mean pack-years smoked over 40 and mean predicted forced expiratory volume of one second (FEV1) less than 50%.High or uneven dropout was considered a high risk of bias in almost 40% of the trials, but conclusions for the primary outcome did not change when the trials at high risk of bias were removed in a sensitivity analysis.Fluticasone increased non-fatal serious adverse pneumonia events (requiring hospital admission) (odds ratio (OR) 1.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.50 to 2.12; 18 more per 1000 treated over 18 months; high quality), and no evidence suggested that this outcome was reduced by delivering it in combination with salmeterol or vilanterol (subgroup differences: I(2) = 0%, P value 0.51), or that different doses, trial duration or baseline severity significantly affected the estimate. Budesonide also increased non-fatal serious adverse pneumonia events compared with placebo, but the effect was less precise and was based on shorter trials (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.62; six more per 1000 treated over nine months; moderate quality). Some of the variation in the budesonide data could be explained by a significant difference between the two commonly used doses: 640 mcg was associated with a larger effect than 320 mcg relative to placebo (subgroup differences: I(2) = 74%, P value 0.05).An indirect comparison of budesonide versus fluticasone monotherapy revealed no significant differences with respect to serious adverse events (pneumonia-related or all-cause) or mortality. The risk of any pneumonia event (i.e. less serious cases treated in the community) was higher with fluticasone than with budesonide (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.34); this was the only significant difference reported between the two drugs. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution because of possible differences in the assignment of pneumonia diagnosis, and because no trials directly compared the two drugs.No significant difference in overall mortality rates was observed between either of the inhaled steroids and the control interventions (both high-quality evidence), and pneumonia-related deaths were too rare to permit conclusions to be drawn. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide and fluticasone, delivered alone or in combination with a LABA, are associated with increased risk of serious adverse pneumonia events, but neither significantly affected mortality compared with controls. The safety concerns highlighted in this review should be balanced with recent cohort data and established randomised evidence of efficacy regarding exacerbations and quality of life. Comparison of the two drugs revealed no statistically significant difference in serious pneumonias, mortality or serious adverse events. Fluticasone was associated with higher risk of any pneumonia when compared with budesonide (i.e. less serious cases dealt with in the community), but variation in the definitions used by the respective manufacturers is a potential confounding factor in their comparison.Primary research should accurately measure pneumonia outcomes and should clarify both the definition and the method of diagnosis used, especially for new formulations such as fluticasone furoate, for which little evidence of the associated pneumonia risk is currently available. Similarly, systematic reviews and cohorts should address the reliability of assigning 'pneumonia' as an adverse event or cause of death and should determine how this affects the applicability of findings.

"BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is currently considered the drug of choice, among the disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) because of its favorable risk/benefit ratio, good safety profile, and low costs. Despite MTX's widespread use and large experience accumulated over the many years since its introduction into clinical practice, specific guidelines have not been published. OBJECTIVE: We report here the available research regarding the optimal dosage and route of MTX administration. METHODS: MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched for articles published between 1990 and 2013, using terms related to RA and MTX. The search was conducted by using both MeSH terms and free text. The references of the retrieved studies were also screened manually for additional articles. RESULTS: For the treatment of rheumatic diseases, the antimetabolite drug MTX can be administered weekly by different routes: oral, subcutaneous, or intramuscular. One of the goals of treatment is to minimize acute and chronic toxicity. A starting dose of 15 mg/week orally, escalating to 25 to 30 mg/week or the highest tolerable dose (with a subsequent switch to parenteral administration in cases of insufficient response), seems to be the optimal evidence-based strategy for MTX treatment of RA. Oral MTX is widely preferred because of its low costs and patient preferences; the bioavailability of parenteral MTX is higher, however. This is supported by data from observational studies, in which patients switching from parenteral to oral MTX at an equal dose had disease exacerbations. In several trials, the subcutaneous formulation of MTX was considered, by both physicians and patients, to be more advantageous in terms of discomfort and compliance. In addition, a significant proportion of patients reported that this formulation led to greater independence, with a resulting improvement in quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Although MTX treatment can be initiated by using the oral administration route, parenteral administration of MTX is indicated in those patients with poor compliance toward the oral form. The subcutaneous route seems to be more effective than the oral route for MTX administration based on the results of several studies, and this route may be preferred because of better usability and absence of pain at the infusion site.

"Abstract: Capsaicin, a topical analgesic used in the treatment of chronic pain, has irritant properties that frequently interrupt its use. In this work, the effect of nanoencapsulation of the main capsaicinoids (capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin) on skin irritation was tested in humans. Skin tolerance of a novel vehicle composed of chitosan hydrogel containing nonloaded nanocapsules (CH-NC) was also evaluated. The chitosan hydrogel containing nanoencapsulated capsaicinoids (CH-NC-CP) did not cause skin irritation, as measured by an erythema probe and on a visual scale, while a formulation containing free capsaicinoids (chitosan gel with hydroalcoholic solution [CH-ET-CP]) and a commercially available capsaicinoids formulation caused skin irritation. Thirty-one percent of volunteers reported slight irritation one hour after application of CH-NC-CP, while moderate (46% [CH-ET-CP] and 23% [commercial product]) and severe (8% [CH-ET-CP] and 69% [commercial product]) irritation were described for the formulations containing free capsaicinoids. When CH-NC was applied to the skin, erythema was not observed and only 8% of volunteers felt slight irritation, which demonstrates the utility of the novel vehicle. A complementary in vitro skin permeation study showed that permeation of capsaicinoids through an epidermal human membrane was reduced but not prevented by nanoencapsulation. "
"Abstract: Self-assembled polymeric nanocapsules (NCs) that incorporate dendrimer porphyrin (DP) in the shells and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) in the cores are fabricated to create a theragnostic platform for the application in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). SPIONs-embedded polystyrene NPs (SPIONs@PS) are used as a template to build up multilayered NCs. The formation of PAH/DP multilayer on the SPIONs@PS is monitored by zeta-pential and fluorescence emission measurement, because the porphyrin unit in the core of DP has strong red fluorescence emission. NCs have strong enough magnetic property (>20 emu/g) for MRI application with typical superparamagnetic behavior, where the linear correlation of R2 and Fe concentration at diluted conditions led to corresponding T2 relaxivity coefficient (r2) value of 93.5 mM(-1) s(-1). Cell viability study upon light irradiation reveals that NCs can successfully work in photosensitizer formulation for PDT. "
"BACKGROUND: Sensory attributes of intranasal corticosteroids, such as rundown to the back of the throat, may influence patient treatment preferences. This study compares the nasal deposition and nasal retention of a radiolabeled solution of ciclesonide nasal aerosol (CIC-hydrofluoroalkane [HFA]) with a radiolabeled suspension of mometasone furoate monohydrate aqueous nasal spray (MFNS) in subjects with either perennial allergic rhinitis (AR) or seasonal AR. METHODS: In this open-label, single-dose, randomized, crossover scintigraphy study, 14 subjects with symptomatic AR received a single dose of radiolabeled 74-μg CIC-HFA (37 μg/spray, 1 spray/each nostril) via a nasal metered-dose inhaler or a single dose of radiolabeled 200-μg MFNS (50 μg/spray, 2 sprays/each nostril), with a minimum 5-day washout period between treatments. Initial deposition (2 minutes postdose) of radiolabeled CIC-HFA and MFNS in the nasal cavity, nasopharynx, and on nasal wipes, and retention of radioactivity in the nasal cavity and nasal run-out on nasal wipes at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 minutes postdose were quantified with scintigraphy. RESULTS: At 2 and 10 minutes postdose, deposition of radiolabeled CIC-HFA was significantly higher in the nasal cavity versus radiolabeled MFNS (99.42% versus 86.50% at 2 minutes, p = 0.0046; and 81.10% versus 54.31% at 10 minutes, p < 0.0001, respectively; p values unadjusted for multiplicity). Deposition of radioactivity on nasal wipes was significantly higher with MFNS versus CIC-HFA at all five time points, and posterior losses of radiolabeled formulation were significantly higher with MFNS at 6, 8, and 10 minutes postdose. CONCLUSION: In this scintigraphic study, significantly higher nasal deposition and retention of radiolabeled aerosol CIC-HFA were observed versus radiolabeled aqueous MFNS in subjects with AR. "
"Abstract: The aim of this research was to develop advanced lipid nanocarriers based on renewable vegetable resources (rice bran oil and raspberry seed oil) that possess self-antioxidative properties, having advantages in terms of minimal side effects and exhibiting the ability to simultaneously co-encapsulate and co-release two active compounds. The focus has been oriented towards developing safe cosmetic formulations with broad-spectrum photoprotection based on these new lipid nanocarriers that contain large amounts of vegetable oils and low concentrations of synthetic UVA and UVB filters (butyl-methoxydibenzoylmethane - BMDBM and octocrylene - OCT). The lipid nanocarriers have a spherical shape and show good physical stability, with a zeta potential in the range of -25.5 to -32.4 mV. Both vegetable oils play a key role in the preparation of efficient nanocarriers, leading to a less ordered arrangement of the lipid core that offers many spaces for the entrapment of large amounts of BMDBM (79%) and OCT (90%), as wells as improved antioxidant activity and UV absorption properties, particularly for the lipid nanocarriers prepared from rice bran oil. By formulating the lipid nanocarriers into creams containing only 3.5% of the UV filters and 10.5% of the vegetable oils, the resulting sunscreens exhibited improved photoprotection, reflecting up to 91% and 93% of UVA and UVB rays, respectively. A new direction of research achieved by this study is the multiple release strategy of both UV filters from the same lipid nanocarrier. After 24 hours, a slow release of BMDBM (less than 4%) and OCT (17.5%) was obtained through a Fick diffusion process. This study demonstrates a significant advance in the areas of both nanotechnology and cosmetics, developing safer cosmetic formulations that possess broad antioxidant, photoprotective and co-release effectiveness due to the existence of a high content of nanostructured vegetable oils combined with a low amount of synthetic UV filters in the same carrier system.

"Abstract: A novel nanoscale-dispersed eye ointment (NDEO) for the treatment of severe evaporative dry eye has been successfully developed. The excipients used as semisolid lipids were petrolatum and lanolin, as used in conventional eye ointment, which were coupled with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) as a liquid lipid; both phases were then dispersed in polyvinyl pyrrolidone solution to form a nanodispersion. Single-factor experiments were conducted to optimize the formulations. A transmission electron micrograph showed that the ointment matrix was entrapped in the nanoemulsion of MCT, with a mean particle size of about 100 nm. The optimized formulation of NDEO was stable when stored for six months at 4 °C, and demonstrated no cytotoxicity to human corneal epithelial cells when compared with commercial polymer-based artificial tears (Tears Natural Forte). The therapeutic effects of NDEO were evaluated on a mouse model with 'dry eye'. Both the tear break-up time and fluorescein staining demonstrated therapeutic improvement, displaying a trend of positive correlation with higher concentrations of ointment matrix in the NDEO formulations compared to a marketed product. Histological evaluation demonstrated that the NDEO restored the normal corneal and conjunctival morphology and is safe for ophthalmic application. "
"Abstract: Over the years, research has focused on strategies to increase benefit/risk ratio of corticoids. However, vehicles intended for topical glucocorticoids delivery with an improved benefit/risk ratio are still on demand. The aim of this work was the in vitro and in vivo characterization of cold processed oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions intended for mometasone furoate (MF) delivery to induce drug targeting to upper skin strata, decreasing adverse effects. Two o/w emulsions, containing 0.1% of MF, were developed differing in the glycol used (2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol - PT and ethoxydiglycol - TC emulsions). In vitro permeation studies revealed that these emulsions are suitable vehicles for the delivery of MF containing ingredients which are responsible for a drastically increased on the permeability coefficients of MF from a theoretical value of 1.18 × 10(-4 )cm/h to 5.20 × 10(-4) ± 2.05 × 10(-4 )cm/h and 6.30 × 10(-4) ± 2.94 × 10(-4 )cm/h, for PT and TC, respectively. The tape stripping results showed that the amount of drug that reached the viable skin layers was very low (1.99 %) and the amount that remained in the stratum corneum (SC) was 10.61%. The in vivo studies showed that the developed formulations decreased the edema and erythema in mice skin in more that 90%, assuring, at least, the same anti-inflammatory effect compared with the commercial cream. PT placebo demonstrated to contribute to restore the skin barrier by increasing the amount of lipids within the human skin. "
"Abstract: Chronic pain, whether localized or generalized, is a widespread, often debilitating condition affecting > 25% of adults in the United States. Oral agents are the cornerstone of chronic pain treatment, but their use may be limited in certain patients, particularly the elderly. Topical therapies offer advantages over systemically administered medications, including the requirement of a lower total systemic daily dose for patients to achieve pain relief, site-specific drug delivery, and avoidance of first-pass metabolism, major drug interactions, infections, and systemic side effects. Several types of topical agents have been shown to be useful in the treatment of patients with chronic pain. Both capsaicin and topical diclofenac have been shown to be effective in the treatment of patients with chronic soft-tissue pain. In patients with hand and knee osteoarthritis (OA), the American College of Rheumatology generally recommends oral treatments (acetaminophen, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], tramadol, and intra-articular corticosteroids) and topical NSAIDs equally, favoring topical agents only for patients who have pre-existing gastrointestinal risk or are aged ≥ 75 years. Topical NSAIDs have been shown to provide relief superior to that of placebo and comparable to that of oral ibuprofen. Similarly, ketoprofen gel has been shown to be superior to placebo and similar to oral celecoxib in reducing pain in patients with knee OA. Different formulations of topical diclofenac (including the diclofenac hydroxyethyl pyrrolidine patch, diclofenac sodium gel, and diclofenac sodium topical solution 1.5% w/w with dimethyl sulfoxide USP) have been shown to be superior to placebo and comparable to oral diclofenac in the treatment of patients with pain due to knee OA, with a lower incidence of gastrointestinal complaints than with the oral formulation. In patients with neuropathic pain, topical forms of both capsaicin and lidocaine have been shown to be useful in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. Lidocaine has also demonstrated efficacy in relieving patient pain due to complex regional pain syndrome and may be useful in the treatment of patients with neuropathic pain who have cancer, although clinical trial results have not been consistent. Data suggest that topical therapies may offer a safe, well-tolerated, and effective alternative to systemic therapies in the treatment of patients with chronic, localized musculoskeletal and neuropathic pain.

"Abstract: Pain management of patients continues to pose challenges to clinicians. Given the multiple dimensions of pain--whether acute or chronic, mild, moderate, or severe, nociceptive or neuropathic--a multimodal approach may be needed. Fortunately, clinicians have an array of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment choices; however, each modality must be chosen carefully, because some often used oral agents are associated with safety and tolerability issues that restrict their use in certain patients. In particular, orally administered nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, opioids, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants are known to cause systemic adverse effects in some patients. To address this problem, a number of topical therapies in various therapeutic classes have been developed to reduce systemic exposure and minimize the risks of patients developing adverse events. For example, topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug formulations produce a site-specific effect (ie, cyclo-oxygenase inhibition) while decreasing the systemic exposure that may lead to undesired effects in patients. Similarly, derivatives of acetylsalicylic acid (ie, salicylates) are used in topical analgesic formulations that do not significantly enter the patient's systemic circulation. Salicylates, along with capsaicin, menthol, and camphor, compose the counterirritant class of topical analgesics, which produce analgesia by activating and then desensitizing epidermal nociceptors. Additionally, patches and creams that contain the local anesthetic lidocaine, alone or co-formulated with other local anesthetics, are also used to manage patients with select acute and chronic pain states. Perhaps the most common topical analgesic modality is the cautious application of cutaneous cold and heat. Such treatments may decrease pain not by reaching the target tissue through systemic distribution, but by acting more directly on the affected tissue. Despite the tolerability benefits associated with avoiding systemic circulation, topically applied analgesics are associated with application-site reactions in patients, such as dryness, erythema, burning, and discoloration. Furthermore, some adverse events that have been observed in patients may be suggestive of some degree of systemic exposure. This article reviews the mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, and tolerability of topical treatments for the management of patient pain. "
"Abstract: Immunologic responses in the skin can be modulated by such neurotransmitters of sensory nerve fibers as substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The first-generation receptor antagonists were peptides with large molecules and had to be injected intracutaneously. The aim of this study was to examine the topical effects of non-peptide antagonists to substance P (aprepitant) and CGRP (telcagepant), respectively, on delayed and immediate reactions in the skin and on associated pruritus. A lipophilic formulation of aprepitant 5% and a hydrophilic formulation of telcagepant 1% were developed. Their effect on the skin barrier was measured in terms of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) while permeation was calculated using permeation coefficients. Patch tests in patients allergic to nickel and prick test reactions to histamine were used as models. None of the treatments increased TEWL, suggesting there to be no impairment of the skin barrier. Permeation coefficients indicated moderate permeation. Histamine prick tests induced a flare with a mean area of 662 + 275 mm(2) and a weal with a mean volume of 49 + 11 mm(3). These reactions as well as histamine-induced pruritus were not affected significantly by any of the treatments. Treatment with aprepitant and its vehicle alone resulted in a potentiating of the infiltration of nickel reactions compared with test reactions obtained after no treatment (1147 + 423 mm(3) and 1427 + 566 mm(3) vs 683 +202 mm(3)) (p = 0.03). Telcagepant induced vasoconstriction in the skin but did not change the infiltration of nickel reactions. None of the treatments influenced the nickel patch test induced pruritus. The data suggest that the topical application of non-peptide antagonists penetrates the skin but does not inhibit contact dermatitis or pruritus. "
"BACKGROUND: In a phase III, open-label, comparative, noninferiority study, 638 subjects receiving de novo kidney transplants were randomized to one of three treatment arms: tacrolimus extended-release (Astagraf XL) qd, tacrolimus (Prograf) bid, or cyclosporine (CsA) bid. All subjects received basiliximab induction, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids. Safety and efficacy follow-up data through 4 years are reported. METHODS: Evaluations included patient and graft survival, study drug discontinuations, laboratory values including renal function and development of new-onset diabetes after transplantation, concomitant medications, and adverse events. RESULTS: At study termination, 129 Astagraf XL, 113 Prograf, and 79 CsA patients had continued follow-up. Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar in all arms. Four-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of patient survival in the Astagraf XL, Prograf, and CsA groups were 93.2, 91.2, and 91.7%, respectively, while graft survival was 84.7, 82.7, and 83.9%, respectively. At least one serious adverse event was reported in the majority of patients in each group during the study (65.9% Astagraf XL, 69.8% Prograf, and 65.6% CsA). Renal function was not significantly different between Astagraf XL and Prograf. HgbA1c levels were collected every 6 months; the 4-year Kaplan-Meier estimate for incidence of HgbA1c levels ≥ 6.5% was significantly higher for both tacrolimus formulations compared to CsA; 41.1% (Astagraf XL), 33.6% (Prograf), and 21.3% (CsA). CONCLUSIONS: In this 4-year follow-up report, patients receiving Astagraf XL and Prograf showed comparable efficacy and safety profiles, with a higher incidence of new-onset diabetes after transplantation but superior renal function compared to patients receiving CsA.

"BACKGROUND: Hyaluronic acid (HA) formulations are used for aesthetic applications. Different cross-linking technologies result in HA dermal fillers with specific characteristic visco-elastic properties. OBJECTIVE: Bio-integration of three CE-marked HA dermal fillers, a cohesive (monophasic) polydensified, a cohesive (monophasic) monodensified and a non-cohesive (biphasic) filler, was analysed with a follow-up of 114 days after injection. Our aim was to study the tolerability and inflammatory response of these fillers, their patterns of distribution in the dermis, and influence on tissue integrity. METHODS: Three HA formulations were injected intradermally into the iliac crest region in 15 subjects. Tissue samples were analysed after 8 and 114 days by histology and immunohistochemistry, and visualized using optical and transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Histological results demonstrated that the tested HA fillers showed specific characteristic bio-integration patterns in the reticular dermis. Observations under the optical and electron microscopes revealed morphological conservation of cutaneous structures. Immunohistochemical results confirmed absence of inflammation, immune response and granuloma. CONCLUSION: The three tested dermal fillers show an excellent tolerability and preservation of the dermal cells and matrix components. Their tissue integration was dependent on their visco-elastic properties. The cohesive polydensified filler showed the most homogeneous integration with an optimal spreading within the reticular dermis, which is achieved by filling even the smallest spaces between collagen bundles and elastin fibrils, while preserving the structural integrity of the latter. Absence of adverse reactions confirms safety of the tested HA dermal fillers. "
"SIGNIFICANCE: Male and female pattern hair loss are common, chronic dermatologic disorders with limited therapeutic options. In recent years, a number of commercial devices using low-level laser therapy have been promoted, but there have been little peer-reviewed data on their efficacy. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatment with a low-level laser device, the US FDA-cleared HairMax Lasercomb®, increases terminal hair density in both men and women with pattern hair loss. METHODS: Randomized, sham device-controlled, double-blind clinical trials were conducted at multiple institutional and private practices. A total of 146 male and 188 female subjects with pattern hair loss were screened. A total of 128 male and 141 female subjects were randomized to receive either a lasercomb (one of three models) or a sham device in concealed sealed packets, and were treated on the whole scalp three times a week for 26 weeks. Terminal hair density of the target area was evaluated at baseline and at 16- and 26-week follow-ups, and analyzed to determine whether the hypothesis formulated prior to data collection, that lasercomb treatment would increase terminal hair density, was correct. The site investigators and the subjects remained blinded to the type of device they dispensed/received throughout the study. The evaluator of masked digital photographs was blinded to which trial arm the subject belonged. RESULTS: Seventy-eight, 63, 49, and 79 subjects were randomized in four trials of 9-beam lasercomb treatment in female subjects, 12-beam lasercomb treatment in female subjects, 7-beam lasercomb treatment in male subjects, and 9- and 12-beam lasercomb treatment in male subjects, compared with the sham device, respectively. Nineteen female and 25 male subjects were lost to follow-up. Among the remaining 122 female and 103 male subjects in the efficacy analysis, the mean terminal hair count at 26 weeks increased from baseline by 20.2, 20.6, 18.4, 20.9, and 25.7 per cm2 in 9-beam lasercomb-treated female subjects, 12-beam lasercomb-treated female subjects, 7-beam lasercomb-treated male subjects, and 9- and 12-beam lasercomb-treated male subjects, respectively, compared with 2.8 (p<0.0001), 3.0 (p<0.0001), 1.6 (p=0.0017), 9.4 (p=0.0249), and 9.4 (p=0.0028) in sham-treated subjects (95% confidence interval). The increase in terminal hair density was independent of the age and sex of the subject and the lasercomb model. Additionally, a higher percentage of lasercomb-treated subjects reported overall improvement of hair loss condition and thickness and fullness of hair in self-assessment, compared with sham-treated subjects. No serious adverse events were reported in any subject receiving the lasercomb in any of the four trials. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We observed a statistically significant difference in the increase in terminal hair density between lasercomb- and sham-treated subjects. No serious adverse events were reported. Our results suggest that low-level laser treatment may be an effective option to treat pattern hair loss in both men and women. Additional studies should be considered to determine the long-term effects of low-level laser treatment on hair growth and maintenance, and to optimize laser modality. "
"Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) possess advantages over the conventional therapies with additional treatment selectivity achieved with local laser irradiation. Comparing to PTT that ablates target tissue via thermal necrosis, PDT induces target cell death via singlet oxygen without damaging the underling connective tissue, thus preserving its biological function. Activatable photosensitizers provide an additional level of treatment selectivity via the disease-associated activation mechanism. In this study, folate-conjugated porphysomes are introduced as targeting-triggered activatable nano-sized beacons for PDT. Porphysomes are reported previously as the most stable and efficient delivery system of porphyrin, but their nanostructure converts the singlet oxygen generation mechanism to thermal ablation mechanism. By folate-receptor-mediated endocytosis, folate-porphysomes are internalized into cells rapidly and resulted in efficient disruption of nanostructures, thus switching back on the photodynamic activity of the densely packed porphyrins for effective PDT. In both in vitro and in vivo studies, folate-porphysomes can achieve folate receptor-selective PDT efficacy, which proves the robustness of targeting-triggered PDT activation of porphysome nanostructure for highly selective tumor ablation. The formulation of porphysomes can be modified with other targeting ligands as activatable photosensitizers for personalized treatment in future. "
"Abstract: Photostability or photo-instability of sunscreen products is most often discussed in undesirable terms with respect to human safety. The health risks, specifically associated with sunscreens, photostable or photo-unstable, include phototoxic/photoirritation or photoallergic responses and, longer-term, an increased risk of skin cancers or photoageing. The aims of this paper are to define photostability/photo-instability and objectively assess the acute and chronic toxicological consequences from the human exposure to UV filter/sunscreens and any probable photo-degradation products. The reported prevalence of photoirritation and photoallergic responses to sunscreens is rare compared with adverse events, for example, skin irritation or sensitization, produced by cosmetics or topically applied drugs and do not directly implicate potential photo-degradation products of UV filters. Moreover, for at least one photo-unstable combination, octyl methoxycinnamate and avobenzone, the long-term benefits to humans, i.e., reduction in skin cancers, seem to outweigh any potential adverse consequences attributed to photo-degradation. Sunscreen products are formulated to achieve maximum efficacy which, by necessity and design, incorporate measures to support and promote photostability since all organic UV filters have the potential to photo-degrade. Current performance measures, in vivo SPF and in vitro UVA, conducted under standardized conditions, in part account for photostability. The concerns expressed when considering human exposure to potential photo-unstable UV filters or sunscreen products may not manifest as health risks under conditions of use. Still, improvement in sunscreen product photostability continues to be a key strategic objective for manufacturers. "
"Abstract: The popularity of TiO2 nanoparticles (nano-TiO2) lies in their wide range of nanotechnological applications, together with low toxicity. Meanwhile, recent studies have shown that the photocatalytic properties of this material can result in alterations in their behavior in the environment, causing effects that have not yet been fully elucidated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of two formulations of nano-TiO2 under different illumination conditions, using an experimental model coherent with the principle of the three Rs of alternative animal experimentation (reduction, refinement, and replacement). Embryos of the fish Danio rerio were exposed for 96h to different concentrations of nano-TiO2 in the form of anatase (TA) or an anatase/rutile mixture (TM), under either visible light or a combination of visible and ultraviolet light (UV). The acute toxicity and sublethal parameters evaluated included survival rates, malformation, hatching, equilibrium, and overall length of the larvae, together with biochemical biomarkers (specific activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and acid phosphatase (AP)). Both TA and TM caused accelerated hatching of the larvae. Under UV irradiation, there was greater mortality of the larvae of the groups exposed to TM, compared to those exposed to TA. Exposure to TM under UV irradiation altered the equilibrium of the larvae. Alterations in the activities of CAT and GST were indicative of oxidative stress, although no clear dose-response relationship was observed. The effects of nano-TiO2 appeared to depend on both the type of formulation and the illumination condition. The findings contribute to elucidation of the factors involved in the toxicity of these nanoparticles, as well as to the establishment of protocols for risk assessments of nanotechnology. "
"Abstract: Rosacea is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease that primarily affects facial skin. Its etiology is unknown, and currently there is no cure. Rosacea can be associated with severe symptoms, including transient erythema (flushing), nontransient erythema, papules, pustules, and telangiectases, leading to substantial discomfort and an unattractive appearance. This randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group study conducted over 12 weeks with a 4-week follow-up period evaluated the efficacy and safety of a new formulation of azelaic acid (AzA) foam in a 15% concentration compared to vehicle alone in patients with papulopustular rosacea (PPR). Primary efficacy variables assessed were investigator global assessment (IGA) dichotomized into success and failure, and nominal change in inflammatory lesion count from baseline to end of treatment. Results indicated that the new foam formulation of AzA is effective and well-tolerated in a population of patients with PPR. Although no single formulation is appropriate for all patients, the development of a new foam formulation in addition to other available vehicles provides patients with options and allows health care providers to match the needs as well as preferences of individual patients and skin types with appropriate delivery modalities.

"Abstract: Sulfur mustard (SM)-induced dermatotoxicity can be prevented by an immediate use of decontamination agents. However, practically due to the time lapse between decontamination and exposure, there is always a possibility of wound formation. In view of this, a hydrophilic decontamination formulation of CC-2 (DRDE/WH-03) was fortified with Aloe vera gel and betaine (DRDE/WH-01) for improving its wound healing ability. Swiss albino mice were exposed to SM percutaneously (5 mg/kg) once, and after 24 hours, DRDE/WH-01, DRDE/WH-03, framycetin, and aloe gel were applied topically, daily for 7 days. Skin sections were subjected to histopathology, histomorphologic grading, tissue leukocytosis, and immunohistochemistry of inflammatory-reparative biomarkers on 3 and 7 days, respectively. DRDE/WH-01, framycetin, and aloe gel showed better reepithelialization, angiogenesis, and fibroplasia compared with DRDE/WH-03 and SM control. On the basis of histomorphologic scale, DRDE/WH-01, framycetin, and aloe gel were found to be equally efficacious. Up-regulation of interleukin-6 and infiltrating leukocytes, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and angiogenesis, fibroblast growth factor, and transforming growth factor-alpha with fibroplasia and reepithelialization were well correlated at various stages of the healing process. DRDE/WH-01 was equally effective as framycetin and has shown improved wound healing efficacy compared with DRDE/WH-03. Thus, DRDE/WH-01 can be recommended as a universal decontaminant and wound healant against vesicant-induced skin injury. "
Abstract: Quantitative estimation of resorcinol from marketed pharmaceutical formulation has been reported in this study. Resorcinol as a pharmaceutical ingredient has a broad spectrum of application but its application is limited due to its toxic side effects. Method for the accurate estimation of resorcinol is therefore essential. In the current study we have developed a chromatographic technique for its estimation from a marketed hair tonic meant for the treatment of several dermatological diseases of the scalp. A stainless steel column 25 cm in length and 4 mm internal diameter packed with octadecylsilane (5 µm) was used for this purpose. The mobile phase was a mixture of phosphate buffer of pH 2.8 and acetonitrile. The flow rate was 0.6 mL·min(-1) and the detection wavelength was 280 nm. The method was found to be linear between concentration range 10.28 µg·mL(-1) to 71.96 µg·mL(-1) with r (2) value 0.999. The accuracy of the method and the intraday and interday precession study presents the applicability of the method for the estimation of resorcinol from any pharmaceutical and cosmetic product containing resorcinol. 
"Abstract: Intravenous (i.v.) formulations with various amounts of organic solvents [PEG400 , propylene glycol (PG), cremophor EL (CrEL)] were used to deliver a fluorinated sulfonamide bacteriochlorin to mice, rats, and minipigs. Biodistribution studies in mice showed that a low-content CrEL formulation combines high bioavailability with high tumor-to-muscle and tumor-to-skin ratios. This formulation was also the most successful in the photodynamic therapy of mice with subcutaneously implanted CT26 murine colon adenocarcinoma tumors. Pharmacokinetic studies in mice and minipigs revealed that with the same low CrEL formulation, the half-life of the photosensitizer in the central compartment was longer in minipigs. Differences in biodistribution with the various formulations, and in pharmacokinetics between the two animal species with the same formulation, are attributed to the interaction of the formulations with low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). Skin photosensitivity studies in rats showed that 30 min exposure of the skin to a solar simulator 7 days after i.v. administration of the fluorinated sulfonamide bacteriochlorin at 1 mg kg(-1) did not elicit significant skin reactions.

"AIMS: Topical ciclosporin A (CsA) is a therapeutic option for dry eye disease (DED) to control ocular surface inflammation and improve tear function. The aim of this study is to systematically review data from randomised clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating efficacy and safety of topical CsA treatment for DED. METHODS: Articles published up to December 2012 were identified from Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. A total of 18 RCTs that evaluated the efficacy and safety of different topical CsA formulations for the treatment of DED were selected according to the set criteria. The Jadad score was calculated to assess RCT quality. RESULTS: The mean Jadad score of the included RCTs was 2.8±0.6. All CsA formulations proved safe for the treatment of DED. Symptoms improved in 100% (9/9) RCTs, tear function improved in 72% (13/18) RCTs and ocular surface damage was ameliorated in 53% (9/17) RCTs in patients with DED. No improvements with CsA treatment versus control were observed in DED resulting from surgical procedures, contact lens use and thyroid orbitopathy. Statistical comparison of CsA efficacy through a meta-analysis of data was not possible due to a lack of standardised criteria and comparable outcomes among studies. CONCLUSIONS: Although topical CsA appears to be a safe treatment for DED, evidence emerging from RCTs is limited, and this affects the strength of recommendations to healthcare providers and policymakers for optimal management. Standardised diagnostic criteria to assess the efficacy of topical CsA are recommended to improve the design of future RCTs in DED. "
"BACKGROUND: The increasing incidence of cancer and the search for more effective therapies with minimal collateral effects have prompted studies to find alternative new treatments. Among these, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been proposed as a very promising new modality in cancer treatment with the lowest rates of side effects, revealing itself to be particularly successful when the photosensitizer is associated with nanoscaled carriers. This study aimed to design and develop a new formulation based on albumin nanospheres containing zinc-phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate (ZnPcS4-AN) for use in the PDT protocol and to investigate its antitumor activity in Swiss albino mice using the Ehrlich solid tumor as an experimental model for breast cancer. METHODS: Ehrlich tumor's volume, histopathology and morphometry were used to assess the efficacy of intratumoral injection of ZnPcS4-AN in containing tumor aggressiveness and promoting its regression, while the toxicity of possible treatments was assessed by animal weight, morphological analysis of the liver and kidneys, hemogram, and serum levels of total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, creatinine and urea. In order to evaluate the efficacy of PDT, groups of animals treated with intratumoral injection of doxorubicin (Dox) were also investigated. RESULTS: Intratumoral injection of ZnPcS4-AN was found to be efficient in mediating PDT to refrain tumor aggressiveness and to induce its regression. Although tumor volume reduction was not significant, PDT induced a remarkable increase in the necrosis area seen in the tumor's central region, as in other experimental groups, including tumor and Dox treated groups, but also in the tumor's peripheral region. Further, PDT showed minimal adverse effects. Indeed, the use of ZnPcS4-AN in mediating PDT revealed anti-neoplastic activity similar to that obtained while using intratumoral Dox therapy. CONCLUSIONS: PDT mediated by the new formulation ZnPcS4-AN enhanced the inhibition of tumor growth while producing practically no adverse effects and thus emerges as a very promising nanotechnology-based strategy for solid cancer treatment.

"BACKGROUND: Photoaging of the hands is common due to frequent exposure to environmental factors. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a topically applied cream formulated with an alpha-hydroxy acid, depigmenting agents, and antioxidants to improve the appearance of characteristics associated with photodamaged hands. METHODS: This was a single-site, open-label study of a proprietary topical treatment (Vivité Vibrance Décolleté, Allergan, Inc.) in adult female subjects with moderate-to-severe photoaging of the hands. The treatment was administered to the hands twice daily over an 8-week period. Treatment efficacy was assessed at baseline and weeks 4 and 8 using the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score based on the percentage coverage and color depth of photodamaged areas. The severity of age spots, freckles, and hand skin discoloration were also assessed; digital and ultraviolet photography of the hands was performed. Subject-reported assessments of treatment efficacy were evaluated using a questionnaire administered at week 8. Statistical significance was defined with an α set at P≤.05. RESULTS: Thirty-five subjects were enrolled with a mean age of 55.6 years; 33 subjects completed the study. The IGA of the appearance of hand photodamage improved from a mean (standard deviation) score of 5.0 (0.8) at baseline to 3.1 (1.5) and 2.6 (1.3) at weeks 4 and 8, respectively (1=mild; 9=severe). Based on expert-grader evaluation, subjects demonstrated statistically significant improvements from baseline in IGA at weeks 4 and 8 in age spots and freckling at weeks 4 and 8, (P<.0003) and in skin discolorations at week 8 (P<.05). The majority of subjects reported that they perceived improvements in each of the 9 parameters associated with skin appearance. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The appearance of age-related hand pigmentation characteristics were significantly improved at 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Subjects reported post-treatment improvements in other characteristics associated with healthy skin. "
"Abstract: Two Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled parallel studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of desoximetasone spray 0.25%, a super-potent topical corticosteroid, twice daily vs vehicle spray twice daily for 28 days in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. At baseline and throughout the study, the severity of disease for the psoriatic lesions was assessed using the Physician Global Assessment (PGA) score and a target lesion was assessed using the Total Lesion Severity Score (TLSS). A designated psoriatic plaque lesion was selected as the target lesion upon enrollment and evaluated throughout the study to determine the TLSS. To qualify for study entry, the subject needed to exhibit a PGA score of 3 (moderate) or 4 (severe) for overall disease severity, and a target lesion with an area of at least 5 cm(2) that achieved a combined score TLSS of >=7, with a plaque elevation score of >=3 (at least moderate). The mean % BSA affected by psoriasis ranged from 13%-17% at baseline. In both Phase 3 studies, a statistically significantly greater percentage of subjects in the desoximetasone spray 0.25% compared to vehicle group achieved both Clinical Success and Treatment Success at Day 28. These results, which were the primary efficacy variables, demonstrated superior efficacy in the active study group for both overall improvement of plaque psoriasis (by PGA) and in the individual psoriasis lesion (by TLSS) designated at baseline as the most severely involved plaque (target lesion). Assessment of secondary efficacy variables in both Phase 3 studies showed that subjects receiving desoximetasone Spray 0.25% twice daily exhibited statistically significantly mean changes from Baseline to Day 28 in PGA, TLSS, and % BSA affected when compared to subjects receiving vehicle spray twice daily. Tolerability and safety were assessed at all study visits. No statistically significant differences were observed between study arms and no major safety signals related to AEs were noted. No stinging and burning were reported with the spray formulation. This Class I topical corticosteroid has shown to be safe and efficacious in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. "
"Abstract: Rising neurodegenerative and depressive disease prevalence combined with the lack of effective pharmaceutical treatments and dangerous side effects, has created an urgent need for the development of effective therapies. Considering that these disorders are multifactorial in origin, treatments designed to interfere at different mechanistic levels may be more effective than the traditional single-targeted pharmacological concepts. To that end, an experimental diet composed of zinc, melatonin, curcumin, piperine, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5, n-3), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6, n-3), uridine, and choline was formulated. This diet was tested on the olfactory bulbectomized rat (OBX), an established animal model of depression and cognitive decline. The ingredients of the diet have been individually shown to attenuate glutamate excitoxicity, exert potent anti-oxidant/anti-inflammatory properties, and improve synaptogenesis; processes that all have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and in the cognitive deficits following OBX in rodents. Dietary treatment started 2 weeks before OBX surgery, continuing for 6 weeks in total. The diet attenuated OBX-induced cognitive and behavioral deficits, except long-term spatial memory. Ameliorating effects of the diet extended to the control animals. Furthermore, the experimental diet reduced hippocampal atrophy and decreased the peripheral immune activation in the OBX rats. The ameliorating effects of the diet on the OBX-induced changes were comparable to those of the NMDA receptor antagonist, memantine, a drug used for the management of Alzheimer's disease. This proof-of-concept study suggests that a diet, which simultaneously targets multiple disease etiologies, can prevent/impede the development of a neurodegenerative and depressive disorders and the concomitant cognitive deficits.

"INTRODUCTION: Psoriasis is an immune-mediated chronic inflammatory skin disease which classically presents as erythematous, scaly plaques affecting extensor surfaces of the limbs, scalp and trunk. Approximately 80% of patients have a mild-to-moderate form routinely treated with topical medications, whereas phototherapy, systemic and biological therapies are typically reserved for treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. AREAS COVERED: The major advances in psoriasis therapy in the past 15 years have been in new immunomodulatory and biological molecules, with a significant unmet need to have new, efficient and safe topical treatment options for the large percentage of patients for whom systemic therapy is not indicated. The available topical therapies (corticosteroids and vitamin D3 analogs) have remained relatively unchanged over the past several decades. This article reviews emerging topical drugs and formulations currently under evaluation in clinical trials. EXPERT OPINION: The time is right for a revolution in our topical therapy armamentarium. It has lagged significantly behind the systemic biological evolution of new drug development. Our large psoriasis population with mild-to-moderate psoriasis certainly deserves potent but safe and innovative topical agents with a new mode of action as well as with long-lasting clinical efficacy.

The Panel reviewed available animal and clinical data in making its determination of safety. "
"Abstract: Pimecrolimus 1% cream is an effective, non-corticosteroid, topical anti-inflammatory treatment for atopic dermatitis (AD). The aim of this article was to review published clinical data that have examined how pimecrolimus can address the medical needs of AD patients. Clinical studies have demonstrated that early treatment with pimecrolimus decreases the progression to disease flares, rapidly improves pruritus and significantly enhances quality of life. Patients find the formulation easy to apply, which may result in improved adherence with the treatment regimen. Pimecrolimus, in contrast to topical corticosteroids (TCSs), does not induce skin atrophy or epidermal barrier dysfunction and is highly effective for the treatment of AD in sensitive skin areas. Furthermore, pimecrolimus reduces the incidence of skin infections compared with TCSs and is not associated with other TCS-related side effects such as striae, telangiectasia and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression. An additional benefit of pimecrolimus is its substantial steroid sparing effect. On the basis of these data, a new treatment algorithm for patients with mild-to-moderate AD is proposed in which pimecrolimus is recommended as a first line therapy for patients with established mild AD at the first signs and symptoms of disease. Pimecrolimus is also recommended for mild-to-moderate AD after initial treatment with a TCS. After resolution of lesions, maintenance treatment with pimecrolimus may effectively prevent subsequent disease flares. In conclusion, the clinical profile of pimecrolimus suggests that it may be considered the drug of choice for the treatment of mild-to-moderate AD in children as well as adults and particularly in sensitive skin areas.

"BACKGROUND: Modified-release tacrolimus (TAC) is a new, once-daily oral formulation of the established immunosuppressive agent TAC. This study evaluated long-term patient adherence, as well as safety and efficacy, in stable patients after heart transplantation (HTx) who switched from a conventional twice daily calcineurin inhibitor-based regimen (TAC or cyclosporine A [CsA]) to a once-daily modified-release TAC regimen. METHODS: Stable patients were switched from conventional TAC or CsA (twice-daily dosing) to modified-release TAC (once-daily dosing) according to manufacturer's recommendations using a pre-experimental design. Self-reported adherence was assessed at baseline and 8 months after the switch with the Basel Assessment of Adherence with Immunosuppressive Medication Scale (BAASIS). Additionally, routine laboratory values were analyzed 8 months after switch. RESULTS: Of 76 patients (58 male, 18 female) initially included, 72 were available for statistical analysis, as modified-release TAC was discontinued due to diarrhea in one patient and gastrointestinal discomfort in three patients. Overall nonadherence at baseline for any of the four BAASIS items was 75.0% versus 40.3% after 8 months (P<0.0001). After 8 months, adherence was improved in 41 patients (56.9%), unchanged in 27 (37.5%), and reduced in four patients (5.6%). The BAASIS visual analog scale score improved significantly from 87.0% ± 13.5% to 97.5% ± 5.7% (P<0.0001). No significant changes were observed for hematological, renal, or liver function parameters after 8 months (all P=not significant). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study in stable patients after HTx to demonstrate a significant improvement in long-term (ie, 8-month) patient adherence after the switch to modified-release TAC. Modified-release TAC was generally well tolerated. Further studies are currently underway to investigate long-term safety after HTx of various calcineurin inhibitors for prevention of rejection and occurrence of side effects. "
"PURPOSE: SAR245408 is a pan-class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. This phase I study determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of two dosing schedules [first 21 days of a 28-day period (21/7) and continuous once-daily dosing (CDD)], pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, and preliminary efficacy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with refractory advanced solid malignancies were treated with SAR245408 using a 3 + 3 design. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined after single and repeated doses. Pharmacodynamic effects were evaluated in plasma, hair sheath cells, and skin and tumor biopsies. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were enrolled. The MTD of both schedules was 600 mg; dose-limiting toxicities were maculopapular rash and hypersensitivity reaction. The most frequent drug-related adverse events included dermatologic toxicities, diarrhea, nausea, and decreased appetite. Plasma pharmacokinetics showed a median time to maximum concentration of 8 to 22 hours, mean terminal elimination half-life of 70 to 88 hours, and 5- to 13-fold accumulation after daily dosing (first cycle). Steady-state concentration was reached between days 15 and 21, and exposure was dose-proportional with doses up to 400 mg. SAR245408 inhibited the PI3K pathway (∼40%-80% reduction in phosphorylation of AKT, PRAS40, 4EBP1, and S6 in tumor and surrogate tissues) and, unexpectedly, also inhibited the MEK/ERK pathway. A partial response was seen in one patient with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Eight patients were progression-free at 6 months. Pharmacodynamic and clinical activity were observed irrespective of tumor PI3K pathway molecular alterations. CONCLUSIONS: SAR245408 was tolerable at doses associated with PI3K pathway inhibition. The recommended phase II dose of the capsule formulation is 600 mg administered orally with CDD. "
"Abstract: The increased awareness of protection against UV radiation damages has led to a rise in the use of topically applied chemical sunscreen agents and to an increased need of innovative carriers designed to achieve the highest protective effect and reduce the toxicological risk resulting from the percutaneous absorption of these substances. In this paper, nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) and nanoemulsions (NE) were formulated to optimize the topical application of different and widespread UVA or UVB sun filters (ethyl hexyltriazone (EHT), diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate (DHHB), bemotrizinol (Tinosorb S), octylmethoxycinnamate (OMC) and avobenzone (AVO)). The preparation and stability parameters of these nanocarriers have been investigated concerning particle size and zeta potential. The release pattern of the sunscreens from NLC and NE was evaluated in vitro, determining their percutaneous absorption through excised human skin. Additional in vitro studies were performed in order to evaluate, after UVA radiation treatment, the spectral stability of the sunfilters once formulated in NLC or NE. From the results obtained, when incorporated in NLC, the skin permeation abilities of the sun filter were drastically reduced, remaining mainly on the surface of the skin. The photostability studies showed that EHT, DHHB and Tinosorb S still retain their photostability when incorporated in these carriers, while OMC and AVO were not photostable as expected. However, no significant differences in terms of photoprotective efficacy between the two carriers were observed. "
"Abstract: Traditional antibiotic therapy to control medical device-based infections typically fails to clear biofilm infections and may even promote the evolution of antibiotic resistant species. We report here the development of two novel antibiofilm agents; gallium (Ga) or zinc (Zn) complexed with protoporphyrin IX (PP) or mesoprotoporphyrin IX (MP) that are both highly effective in negating suspended bacterial growth and biofilm formation. These chelated gallium or zinc complexes act as iron siderophore analogs, supplanting the natural iron uptake of most bacteria. Poly (ether urethane) (PEU; Biospan®) polymer films were fabricated for the controlled sustained release of the Ga- or Zn-complexes, using an incorporated pore-forming agent, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). An optimum formulation containing 8% PEG (MW=1450) in the PEU polymer effectively sustained drug release for at least 3months. All drug-loaded PEU films exhibited in vitro ≥ 90% reduction of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria in both suspended and biofilm culture versus the negative control PEU films releasing nothing. Cytotoxicity and endotoxin evaluation demonstrated no adverse responses to the Ga- or Zn-complex releasing PEU films. Finally, in vivo studies further substantiate the anti-biofilm efficacy of the PEU films releasing Ga- or Zn- complexes. "
"Abstract: Cyclosporine was proven efficacious in the treatment of feline hypersensitivity dermatitis. This target animal study was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of ATOPICA for Cats® (cyclosporine oral solution, USP) MODIFIED following 6-month daily dosing in cats. Forty healthy cats (four cats/sex/group) received 0, 8 (1×), 16 (2×), 24 (3×), or 40 (5×) mg/kg cyclosporine once daily for 6 months (183 days). Body weight, food consumption, ophthalmoscopic, physical examinations including neurological assessments, blood pressure, electrocardiography, clinical pathology (hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, urinalysis), organ weights, and macroscopic and microscopic examinations were performed and assessed. In addition, blood concentrations of cyclosporine were measured at the pretreatment trough on Days 1, 2, 7, 14, 31, 91, 154, and 182, and post-treatment on Days 1, 31, and 182. Adverse effects possibly related to treatment included prolonged APTT and one report each of bone marrow hypocellularity and lymphoma; all occurred in cats treated with doses more than 16 mg/kg. There was no significant accumulation of cyclosporine beyond the first week of treatment. Results confirm that ATOPICA for Cats is safe and well tolerated in cats without unexpected accumulation beyond the first week of treatment when administered as directed. "
"Abstract: Aconitine (AC) is a highly toxic alkaloid from bioactive plants of the genus Aconitum, some of which have been widely used as medicinal herbs for thousands of years. In this study, we systematically evaluated the potential role of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the mechanisms underlying the low and variable bioavailability of oral AC. First, the bidirectional transport of AC across Caco-2 and MDCKII-MDR1 cells was investigated. The efflux of AC across monolayers of these two cell lines was greater than its influx. Additionally, the P-gp inhibitors, verapamil and cyclosporin A, significantly decreased the efflux of AC. An in situ intestinal perfusion study in rats showed that verapamil co-perfusion caused a significant increase in the intestinal permeability of AC, from 0.22×10(-5) to 2.85×10(-5) cm/s. Then, the pharmacokinetic profile of orally administered AC with or without pre-treatment with verapamil was determined in rats. With pre-treatment of verapamil, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of AC increased sharply, from 39.43 to 1490.7 ng/ml. Accordingly, a 6.7-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-12h) of AC was observed when co-administered with verapamil. In silico docking analyses suggested that AC and verapamil possess similar P-gp recognition mechanisms. This work demonstrated that P-gp is involved in limiting the intestinal absorption of AC and attenuating its toxicity to humans. Our data indicate that potential P-gp-mediated drug-drug interactions should be considered carefully in the clinical application of aconite and formulations containing AC. "
"Abstract: Pruritus is a common symptom encountered by many different specialties. One must clinically differentiate between pruritus associated with skin disease or inflammation and pruritus with normal skin. Searching for possible underlying diseases is indispensable, because pruritus can be very chronic and has multiple pathogenetic mechanisms. Therapy – especially topical therapy – is difficult and often not successful. Very often systemic treatment has to be combined with topical approaches, considering both the active ingredients and appropriate vehicles. There are still open therapeutic gaps in the pharmaceutical product market, which can partially be resolved by using standard prescriptions for formulations. Due to the new pharmacy practice order, standardized compounded formulations should be given preference, since individual formulations often do not pass the plausibility check of the compounding pharmacist. Also the use of cosmetic ingredients (by example, commercial cold creams) is no longer permitted, since only ingredients with pharmaceutical quality can be used in compounding. We will show – based on practical cases – different therapeutic options for treatment with standardized magistral formulations from the NRF (New German Pharmacopoeia for compounded medications). "
"BACKGROUND: Hyaluronic acid (HA) gels are commonly used to correct age-related midface volume deficit (MVD), yet the Food and Drug Administration has not specifically approved them for this purpose. OBJECTIVE: To study the safety and effectiveness of a new 20-mg/mL HA gel (VYC-20L) specifically formulated and optimized for mid-face volumizing. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A multicenter, single-blind, controlled study randomized 235 subjects aged 35 to 65 with MVD to a treatment group and 47 to a no-treatment control group. Responders were defined as subjects who achieved improvement of 1 point or more on the validated 6-point Mid-Face Volume Deficit Scale (MFVDS) at 6 months as rated live by two blinded independent evaluators. The primary endpoint required a 70% or greater treatment group response and a statistically significant difference (p < .001) between the treatment and control group responder rates. RESULTS: The primary endpoint was met, with 85.6% of the treatment group improving by 1 point or more on the MFVDS at month 6 and a statistically significant difference (p < .001) between the treatment and control group responder rates. Subjects tolerated VYC-20L well, with no unanticipated adverse device effects. Nearly half of subjects maintained correction for 24 months. CONCLUSION: VYC-20L is safe and effective for age-related MVD, with correction lasting up to 2 years. "
"Abstract: For nearly a decade, thermoresponsive ophthalmic in situ gels have been recognized as an interesting and promising ocular topical delivery vehicle for lipophilic drugs. In this study, a series of thermosensitive copolymers, hyaluronic acid-g-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (HA-g-PNIPAAm), was synthesized, by coupling carboxylic end-capped PNIPAAm to aminated hyaluronic acid through amide bond linkages, and was used as a potential carrier for the topical ocular administration of cyclosporine A (CyA). The lower critical solution temperature of HA-g-PNIPAAm59 in aqueous solutions was measured as 32.7°C, which was not significantly affected by the polymer concentration. Moreover, HA-g-PNIPAAm59 microgels showed a high drug loading efficiency (73.92%) and a controlled release profile that are necessary for biomedical application. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) observations showed that HA-g-PNIPAAm microgels were spherical in shape with homogeneous size. Based on the result of the eye irritation test, the HA-g-PNIPAAm microgels formulation was shown to be safe and nonirritant for rabbit eyes. In addition, HA-g-PNIPAAm microgels achieved significantly higher CyA concentration levels in rabbit corneas (1455.8 ng/g of tissue) than both castor oil formulation and commercial CyA eye drops. Therefore, these newly described thermoresponsive HA-g-PNIPAAm microgels demonstrated attractive properties to serve as pharmaceutical delivery vehicles for a variety of ophthalmic applications. "
"Abstract: Paclitaxel (PCT) is a cytotoxic agent with a broad antineoplastic activity. IV formulation of PCT causes hypersensitivity reactions in some patients and oral administration is an alternative to decrease the side effects. PCT is not orally available because of low solubility, lack of intestinal permeability, and efflux by pumps in intestinal wall. PCT solution in cremophor EL: ethanol (100 mg/kg) was administered orally to rats after pre-treatment by mefenamic acid, ibuprofen, verapamil, cyclosporine, and verapamil+ibuprofen in individual groups. Ibuprofen presented positive effect on intestinal permeation of PCT. C(max) and area under the serum concentration versus time curve (AUC) after pre-treatment by ibuprofen was decreased when the oral dose of PCT was decreased to 50 and 25 mg/kg, while dose-blood concentration relationship was nonlinear. Rise in oral bioavailability of PCT after pre-treatment by cyclosporine was lower than ibuprofen. It seems that by using ibuprofen in concomitant with potent P-gp inhibitors before PCT solution, oral delivery of PCT could be promising. "
"Abstract: Pimecrolimus cream 1% is approved for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in children older than two years of age and adults. Tacrolimus ointment 0.03% is approved for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in the patient population between two to seventeen years of age and Tacrolimus 0.1% ointment for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in patients 18 years of age and older. However, beyond safety and efficacy, the delivery system or vehicle used in topical treatment formulations is equally important in affecting patient satisfaction, tolerability, and subsequent treatment compliance and hence clinical resolution of active disease.

"Abstract: Psoriasis is an autoimmune, chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by epidermal hyperplasia, proliferation of blood vessels, and infiltration of leukocytes in dermis and epidermis. Several immunosuppressants such as methotrexate (MXT) and cyclosporine are used but they are associated with adverse effects due to down regulation of immune system. Numerous approaches have been explored to overcome the problems of conventional topical system such as high frequency of application, impermeability to skin barrier, and limited efficacy. Photodynamic therapy is another non-invasive technique currently used for skin diseases. The combination of two drugs is also commonly observed to achieve more effective therapy. In the present study, antipsoriatic activity of niosomal formulations for the treatment of psoriasis in combination with narrow and broad band UV radiation had been explored in experimental animal model.

"Abstract: Dimethyl fumarate is an orally available treatment option for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) in a new formulation with improved gastroenteric coating. The mode of action comprises immunomodulatory effects and an activation of nuclear (erythroid-derived 2) related factor mediated antioxidative response pathways leading to additional cytoprotective effects. In two pivotal phase III trials, dimethyl fumarate, 240 mg twice daily, reduced relapse rates by about 50 % as compared with placebo. In the DEFINE trial, progression of disability was also significantly reduced. Both trials demonstrated a significant reduction of gadolinium-enhanced lesions as well as T2 lesions on cranial MRI. The studies revealed a beneficial safety profile of dimethyl fumarate. The most prevalent side effects were transient flushing and gastrointestinal tract irritation. Dimethyl fumarate has recently been approved in the USA for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. The compound is a welcome addition to the immunomodulatory treatment armamentarium for MS patients and physicians alike. "
"Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disorder. Allopathic treatments for RA have various side-effects and limitations. Majoon Suranjan (MS) is a polyherbal Unani formulation used to treat RA. Although it is widely used, evidence-based toxicity and efficacy data are not available. The present study was designed to assess the safety and therapeutic efficacy of MS in experimental animals. Acute (14 days) and long-term (90 days) toxicity studies were carried out at three doses of MS, i.e. 440, 880 and 1760 mg/kg body weight in male and female Wistar rats. Arthritis was induced in male rats by immunization with bovine collagen type II and they were treated with vehicle, methotrexate (0.25 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal once weekly) and MS (880 mg/kg body weight, orally, daily) for 20 days. Serum rheumatoid factor, anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, antinuclear antibody and C-reactive protein (CRP) were estimated. None of the rats exhibited overt toxicity or mortality and MS was found to be safe at the tested doses. No abnormal findings were observed in haematological and biochemical parameters, necropsy and histopathology at therapeutic effective dose. MS significantly inhibited the footpad swelling in arthritic rats while serum autoantibodies and CRP levels were significantly decreased. The present study demonstrates that at therapeutic doses, the Unani medicine, MS is relatively safe. Furthermore, MS was found to be effective in decreasing the biomarkers of RA, thus providing scientific evidence in support of its traditional use in the treatment of RA. "
"Abstract: Although zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) have been widely formulated in sunscreens, the relationship between reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation induced by these particles, zinc ions, and cytotoxicity is not clearly understood. This study explores whether these factors can be accurately quantified and related. The study demonstrates a strong correlation between ZnO NP-induced cytotoxicity and free intracellular zinc concentration (R (2) = .945) in human immune cells, indicating a requirement for NP dissolution to precede cytotoxicity. In addition, although direct exposure to ZnO NPs was found to induce cytotoxicity at relatively high concentrations, indirect exposure (via dialysis) was not cytotoxic, even at extremely high concentrations, highlighting a requirement for NP-to-cell contact. Elevated levels of ROS present in NP-exposed cells also correlated to both cytotoxicity and intracellular free zinc. Although the addition of antioxidant was able to reduce ROS, cytotoxicity to ZnO NPs was unaffected, suggesting ROS may be, in part, a result of cytotoxicity rather than a causal factor. This study highlights both the requirement and role of intracellular dissolution of zinc nanomaterials to elicit a cytotoxic response. This response is only partially ROS dependent, and therefore, modification of NP uptake and their intracellular solubility are key components in modulating the bioactivity of ZnO NPs. "
"Abstract: Adequate sun protection is often neglected during occupational outdoor work. To investigate the acceptance and usability of sunscreens during outdoor work a single-blind, randomized-controlled, cross-over trial was performed in 40 subjects. Two sunscreen formulations were used daily on working days for 4 weeks at a time, with a wash-out phase before crossover. The primary outcome was overall acceptance of the products with daily application. More than 80% of the outdoor workers were fully satisfied with the cosmetic properties, sweat resistance, performance and usability of both products under outdoor working conditions. With respect to overall performance, the milk was rated slightly better than the gel. In terms of ease of application, the milk was preferred (p<0.05). Sunscreens for those working outdoors must contain very high, broad-spectrum, photostable filters for both UVB and UVA, they must be easy to apply and sweat resistant, and should not irritate the eyes. "
"CONTEXT: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder. Habb-e-Asgand (HEA) is a polyherbal, Unani formulation widely used in the treatment of RA. Traditional systems of medicine or plant-based drugs are an attractive alternative treatment because of their professed efficacy in curing the disease. Medicinal herbs and herbal formulations are generally considered to be safer than the conventional drugs for RA. Unani drugs are known not to produce toxic effects and are presumed to be nontoxic. However, no objective, verifiable data exists to support the claims of nontoxicity and efficacy. OBJECTIVES: The present study was designed to evaluate the safety and therapeutic efficacy of HEA in Wistar rats. SETTING: The study took place at the University College of Medical Sciences and GTB Hospital, University of Delhi, Dilshad Garden, Delhi, India. DESIGN: Oral toxicity studies--one acute (14 d) and one long-term (90 d)--were carried out using three doses of HEA--57.5, 115, and 230 mg/kg body weight (BWT)--in both male and female rats. The research team also carried out a study on antirheumatic activity. The team induced arthritis in three groups of male rats using collagen type II (CII), and for 20 d, one group was treated once weekly with saline; a second group was treated once weekly with methotrexate (MTX) at 0.25 mg/kg BWT IP; and a third group was treated daily with HEA at 115 mg/kg BWT orally. A control group received saline but was not induced with RA. OUTCOME MEASURES: Rheumatoid factor (RF); anticyclic citrullinated peptide (a-CCP) antibody; antinuclear antibody (ANA); and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. RESULTS: The acute and long-term, oral toxicity studies showed that HEA administration did not produce any overt toxicity or mortality and that it was safe at all dose levels tested. No major alterations were observed in hematology, serum biochemistry, necropsy, and histopathology at the therapeutic equivalent dose (ie, 115 mg/kg BWT). HEA administration for 20 d in arthritis-induced rats significantly reduced the levels of autoantibodies and CRP, and the results were comparable with those of MTX, the standard, disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). CONCLUSION: The study's results provided evidence that HEA is not toxic at the therapeutic dose. The antiarthritic activity of HEA may be due to its disease-modifying activities, thus supporting the traditional use of this formulation for treatment of RA. "
"Abstract: Immunosuppressive therapy (IST) with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine A is the standard treatment for aplastic anemia (AA). The ATG formulation in Japan was changed from horse ATG [Lymphoglobulin(®) (LG)] to rabbit ATG [Thymoglobulin(®) (TG)] in 2009. Since then, 12 patients with AA have been treated with TG. Here, we summarize the effectiveness and safety of TG in comparison with data from 14 AA patients treated with LG before April 2009. One subject treated with LG but none treated with TG terminated the treatment due to a grade III adverse effect. The overall 6-month response rate after IST was similar for LG and TG (67 and 75 %). Infection was noted in five (38 %) and four (33 %) subjects treated with LG and TG, respectively. The initial response rate was significantly higher in the early-treatment group treated within a year of diagnosis than in the late-treatment group, who were treated more than a year after diagnosis (85 vs. 29 %, respectively), as reported previously, without apparent differences between the LG and TG groups. We conclude that TG at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day for 5 days is effective and safe in Japanese patients with AA. "
"Abstract: Radiation dermatitis (RD) results from radiotherapy and often occurs within the first 4 weeks of treatment, although late effects also occur. While RD may resolve over time, it can have a profound effect on patients' quality of life and lead to dose modifications. A study group of international, interdisciplinary experts convened to develop RD prevention and treatment guidelines based on evidence from randomized, controlled trials. Evidence-based recommendations were developed after an extensive literature review. Randomized, controlled trials with standardized measurement of outcomes were considered the best evidence, and a majority of the recommendations were formulated from this literature. The adoption of washing with water, with or without a mild soap, and allowing the use of antiperspirants is supported by randomized trials. Use of topical prophylactic corticosteroids (mometasone) is recommended to reduce discomfort and itching. There is some evidence that silver sulfadiazine cream can reduce dermatitis score. There is insufficient evidence to support, and therefore the panel recommends against the use of trolamine, topical sulcrate, hyaluronic acid, ascorbic acid, silver leaf dressing, light-emitting diode lasers, Theta cream, dexpanthenol, calendula, proteolytic enzymes, sulcralfate, oral zinc, and pentoxifylline. Moreover, there is no evidence to support the superiority for any specific intervention in a reactive fashion. For patients with established radiation-induced telangiectasia and fibrosis, the panel suggests the use of pulse dye laser for visual appearance, and the use of pentoxifylline and vitamin E for the reduction of fibrosis.

"Abstract: Fungal plant pathogens such as Fusarium graminearum cause severe global economic losses in cereals crops, and current control measures are limited. This work addresses the potential for ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) and biocontrol bacteria to be used in plant fungal control strategies. Growth of F. graminearum was significantly (p = 0.05) inhibited by inclusion of the NPs in a mung bean broth agar and in sand. Suspension in mung bean broth medium modified the surface charge, dissolution, and aggregation state of the ZnO NPs, in comparison to processes occurring in water suspension. The ZnO NPs were significantly more inhibitory to fungal growth than micro-sized particles of ZnO, although both types of particles released similar levels of soluble Zn, indicating size-dependent toxicity of the particles. Zn ions produced dose-dependent inhibition, noticeable at the level of soluble Zn released from NPs after seven-day suspension in medium; inhibitory levels caused acidification of the growth medium. Transfer of fungal inoculum after exposure to the ZnO NPs to fresh medium did not indicate adaptation to the stress because growth was still inhibited by the NPs. The ZnO NPs did not prevent metabolites from a biocontrol bacterium, Pseudomonas chlororaphis O6, from inhibiting Fusarium growth: no synergism was observed in the mung bean agar. Because other studies find that soil amendment with ZnO NPs required high doses for inhibition of plant growth, the findings of pathogen growth control reported in this paper open the possibility of using ZnO NP-based formulations to complement existing strategies for improving crop health in field settings.

"Abstract: The most challenging and wanted development in photodynamic therapy is the control of photosensitizer (PS) cytolocalization and the mechanism of cell death. 5,10,15-triphenyl-20-(3-N-methylpyridinium-yl)porphyrin (3MMe) administered to HeLa cells as DMSO solution accumulates in the cytoplasmic membrane (CM) where it causes severe photodamage and cell necrosis. In contrast, when incorporated in marine atelocollagen/xantham gum polymeric nanocapsules, the PS is shuttled through CM allowing its gradual release and accumulation in mitochondria and lysosomes. Little photodamage was caused to cells in this case, but compelling evidences are presented showing that encapsulation changes the cytolocalization and shifts the cell death mechanism from necrosis to apoptosis. In conclusion, both of those challenges can be overcome by encapsulation of typical PSs such as 3MMe by using the new concept of photodynamic treatment with minimal cell damage by targeting specifically some key organelles. We are confident that these findings are important for the development of more efficient photosensitizers tailored to induce apoptosis while minimizing undesirable side effects such as over-inflammation.

"Abstract: Burns, chronic wounds, osteoarthritis, and uveitis are examples of conditions characterized by local, intense inflammatory responses that can impede healing or even further tissue degradation. The most powerful anti-inflammatory drugs available are often administered systemically, but these carry significant side effects and are not compatible for patients that have underlying complications associated with their condition. Conjugation of monoclonal antibodies that neutralize pro-inflammatory cytokines to high molecular weight hydrophilic polymers has been shown to be an effective strategy for local control of inflammation. Lead formulations are based on antibody inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor-α conjugated to hyaluronic acid having molecular weight greater than 1 MDa. This review will discuss fundamental aspects of medical conditions that could be treated with these conjugates and design principles for preparing these cytokine-neutralizing polymer conjugates. Results demonstrating that infliximab, an approved inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor-α, can be incorporated into the conjugates using a broad range of water-soluble polymers are also presented, along with a prospectus for clinical translation.

"Abstract: The work investigates the eco-cytoxicity of submicron and nano TiO₂ and ZnO, arising from the unique interactions of freshwater microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to soluble and undissolved components of the metal oxides. In a freshwater medium, submicron and nano TiO₂ exist as suspended aggregates with no-observable leaching. Submicron and nano ZnO undergo comparable concentration-dependent fractional leaching, and exist as dissolved zinc and aggregates of undissolved ZnO. Cellular internalisation of solid TiO₂ stimulates cellular ROS generation as an early stress response. The cellular redox imbalance was observed for both submicron and nano TiO₂ exposure, despite exhibiting benign effects on the alga proliferation (8-day EC50>100 mg TiO₂/L). Parallel exposure of C. reinhardtii to submicron and nano ZnO saw cellular uptake of both the leached zinc and solid ZnO and resulting in inhibition of the alga growth (8-day EC50≥0.01 mg ZnO/L). Despite the sensitivity, no zinc-induced cellular ROS generation was detected, even at 100 mg ZnO/L exposure. Taken together, the observations confront the generally accepted paradigm of cellular oxidative stress-mediated cytotoxicity of particles. The knowledge of speciation of particles and the corresponding stimulation of unique cellular responses and cytotoxicity is vital for assessment of the environmental implications of these materials.

"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Many topical formulations include antioxidants to improve the antioxidant capability of the skin. This study evaluated the ability of a unique combination of antioxidants including resveratrol, green tea polyphenols, and caffeine to reduce facial redness. METHODS: Subjects (n=16) presenting with facial redness applied the resveratrol-enriched product twice daily to the entire face. Reduction in redness was evaluated by trained staff members and dermatology house staff officers. Evaluators compared clinical photographs and spectrally enhanced images taken before treatment and at 2-week intervals for up to 12 weeks. RESULTS: 16 of 16 clinical images showed improvement and 13 of 16 spectrally enhanced images were improved. Reduction in facial redness continued to evolve over the duration of the study period but was generally detectable by 6 weeks of treatment. Adverse effects were not observed in any subject. CONCLUSION: The skin product combination of resveratrol, green tea polyphenols, and caffeine safely reduces facial redness in most patients by 6 weeks of continuous treatment and may provide further improvement with additional treatment.

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although glucocorticosteroids are considered the first-line treatment in sarcoidosis, refractory cases require alternatives, such as methotrexate (MTX). The aim of this study was to develop, on behalf of the World Association of Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous Disorders (WASOG), multinational evidence-based recommendations for the use of MTX in sarcoidosis for routine clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS: A systematic literature search was conducted and combined with the opinions of sarcoidosis experts worldwide to formulate the recommendations. An online survey concerning 10 clinical questions was sent through the WASOG newsletter to sarcoidosis experts. Agreement about the recommendations amongst the world's leading sarcoidologists was evaluated. A total of 237 articles were identified, 43 of which were included. Randomized controlled trial evidence supporting the use of MTX in sarcoidosis was limited. Forty-five per cent (113 of 250) of the sarcoidosis experts contacted completed the survey (Europe 55%, North America 26% and Asia 12%). Ten recommendations were formulated concerning the indications for use, starting dose, folic acid, work-up, contraindications, monitoring, administration options in case of adverse gastrointestinal effects, hepatotoxicity, long-term safety and use during pregnancy and breast feeding. SUMMARY: Ten multinational evidence-based recommendations for the use of MTX in sarcoidosis were developed, which are supported by the world's foremost sarcoidosis experts. "
"Abstract: Topical tretinoin has been approved for use in dermatology for 40 years and is currently approved for the treatment of acne vulgaris and photodamage. During this time, topical tretinoin has accumulated significant efficacy and safety data in the treatment of acne and photodamaged skin and demonstrated clinical potential for treating a range of other dermatologic conditions. The diverse effects may be due to complex underlying mechanisms of action associated with tretinoin, including keratolytic activity, collagenesis, and other mechanisms associated with the activation of nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARα, RARβ, and RARγ). In this article, we review the history of topical tretinoin use to date and outline emerging research suggesting that topical tretinoin may have potential clinical use for treating a multitude of other dermatological conditions when used either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. We also describe newer formulations of topical tretinoin that have been designed to reduce irritation potential. In light of the substantial history of safety and efficacy of topical tretinoin in acne and photodamage, we speculate that it holds promise in treating many additional dermatological conditions, which may be explored in future research.

"CONTEXT: Essential requirements for the efficacy of sunscreen agents are optimal UV absorption, high photostability and resistance against water removal. OBJECTIVE: Aim of this study was to investigate the effect of encapsulation in lipid microparticles (LMs) on the overall performance of the two most commonly used sunscreen agents, octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC) and butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (BMDBM). METHODS: LMs loaded with OMC and BMDBM were prepared by melt emulsification and characterized by optical microscopy, UV filter content and release studies. The LMs incorporating OMC and BMDBM or the nonencapsulated sunscreen agents were introduced into a model cream (oil-in-water emulsion). RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between the sun protection factor (SPF) of the formulations containing the free (SPF, 9.4 ± 1.9) or microencapsulated (SPF, 9.6 ± 1.3) UV filters. Irradiation of the creams with a solar simulator demonstrated that the photodecomposition of OMC and BMDBM was significantly decreased by encapsulation in LMs from 55.7 ± 5.3% to 46.1 ± 5.1% and 36.3 ± 3.9% to 20.1 ± 4.7%, respectively. However, in vitro water-resistance studies showed that entrapment in the LMs significantly enhanced the sunscreen agent removal caused by watering (the losses for OMC and BMDBM were 45.1 ± 6.3% and 49.2 ± 8.4%, respectively), as compared to the formulation with the nonencapsulated sunscreen agents (the losses for OMC and BMDBM were 26.7 ± 6.1% and 28.0 ± 6.7%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Incorporation in LMs can have controversial effects on UV filter efficacy. In particular, the water-resistance properties of sun-care formulations containing sunscreens loaded in LMs should be verified to assure that the photoprotective activity is maintained during usage.

"Abstract: Understanding mechanisms of neuropathic orofacial pain, targets of treatment, and basic pharmacology and working with informed compounding pharmacists may result in significant benefit for patients. The clinical significance of topical medications is improvement of quality of life for patients by providing a unique medication delivery system for neuropathic orofacial pain and other dental and extraoral conditions. The use of this route of administration has decreased or minimized side effects compared with other methods and is especially useful in medically compromised and elderly patients. These innovations, supported and improved by ongoing research, will augment the armamentarium of the clinician treating orofacial pain disorders. "
"Abstract: Quercetin (QT) was formulated into a novel self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS) to improve its oral bioavailability and antioxidant potential compared to free drug. Capmul MCM was selected as the oily phase on the basis of optimum solubility of QT in oil. Tween 20 and ethanol were selected as surfactant and cosurfactant from a large pool of excipients, depending upon their spontaneous self-emulsifying ability with the selected oily phase. Pseudoternary-phase diagrams were constructed to identify the efficient self-emulsification regions in various dilution media, viz., water, pH 1.2, and pH 6.8. The ratio of 40:40:20 w/w, Capmul MCM:QT (19:1)/Tween 20/ethanol was optimized based on its ability to form a spontaneous submicrometer emulsion in simulated gastrointestinal fluids. DPPH scavenging assay showed comparable antioxidant activity of QT-SEDDS to free QT. QT-SEDDS was robust in terms of stability against short-term excursion of freeze/thaw cycles and accelerated stability for 6 months as per International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines. A fluorescent dye-loaded SEDDS formulation showed rapid internalization within 1h of incubation with Caco-2 cells as evident by confocal laser scanning microscopy. QT-SEDDS showed a significant increase in cellular uptake by 23.75-fold in comparison with free QT cultured with Caco-2 cells. The SEDDS demonstrated ~5-fold enhancement in oral bioavailability compared to free QT suspension. The in vitro-in vivo relation between in vitro Caco-2 cell uptake and in vivo pharmacokinetics of QT-SEDDS showed a correlation coefficient of ~0.9961, as evident from a Levy plot. Finally, QT-SEDDS showed a significantly higher in vivo antioxidant potential compared to free QT when evaluated as a function of ability to combat doxorubicin- and cyclosporin A-induced cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, respectively.

"BACKGROUND: The common cold is one of the most widespread illnesses and is a leading cause of visits to the doctor and absenteeism from school and work. Trials conducted in high-income countries since 1984 investigating the role of zinc for the common cold symptoms have had mixed results. Inadequate treatment masking and reduced bioavailability of zinc from some formulations have been cited as influencing results. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether zinc (irrespective of the zinc salt or formulation used) is efficacious in reducing the incidence, severity and duration of common cold symptoms. In addition, we aimed to identify potential sources of heterogeneity in results obtained and to assess their clinical significance. SEARCH METHODS: In this updated review, we searched CENTRAL (2012, Issue 12), MEDLINE (1966 to January week 2, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to January 2013), CINAHL (1981 to January 2013), Web of Science (1985 to January 2013), LILACS (1982 to January 2013), WHO ICTRP and clinicaltrials.gov. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials using zinc for at least five consecutive days to treat, or for at least five months to prevent the common cold. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. MAIN RESULTS: Five trials were identified in the updated searches in January 2013 and two of them did not meet our inclusion criteria. We included 16 therapeutic trials (1387 participants) and two preventive trials (394 participants). Intake of zinc was associated with a significant reduction in the duration (days) (mean difference (MD) -1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.72 to -0.34) (P = 0.003) (I(2) statistic = 89%) but not the severity of common cold symptoms (MD -1.06, 95% CI -2.36 to 0.23) (P = 0.11) (I(2) statistic = 84%). The proportion of participants who were symptomatic after seven days of treatment was significantly smaller (odds ratio (OR) 0.45, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.00) (P = 0.05) than those in the control, (I(2 )statistic = 75%). The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of developing a cold (IRR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.88) (P = 0.006) (I(2) statistic = 88%), school absence (P = 0.0003) and prescription of antibiotics (P < 0.00001) was lower in the zinc group. Overall adverse events (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.09) (P = 0.002), bad taste (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.71 to 3.11) (P < 0.00001) and nausea (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.44 to 3.23) (P = 0.002) were higher in the zinc group. The very high heterogeneity means that the averaged estimates must be viewed with caution. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Zinc administered within 24 hours of onset of symptoms reduces the duration of common cold symptoms in healthy people but some caution is needed due to the heterogeneity of the data. As the zinc lozenges formulation has been widely studied and there is a significant reduction in the duration of cold at a dose of ≥ 75 mg/day, for those considering using zinc it would be best to use it at this dose throughout the cold. Regarding prophylactic zinc supplementation, currently no firm recommendation can be made because of insufficient data. When using zinc lozenges (not as syrup or tablets) the likely benefit has to be balanced against side effects, notably a bad taste and nausea. "
"AIMS: To develop a semi-high-throughput ex vivo mucosal model for determining efficacy and toxicity of antiseptics. METHODS AND RESULTS: Explants (5 mm) from freshly excised, porcine vaginal mucosa were infected with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (1 × 10(6)  CFU) at the epithelial surface for 2 h. Haematoxylin and eosin staining revealed healthy uninfected tissue and only minor disruptions in tissue infected with methicillin susceptible Staph. aureus (MSSA), which remained in outer epithelial cell layers. After 2 h infection, 10 μl of chlorhexidine digluconate (CHG, 3%), povidone-iodine (PI, 7·5%), octenidine dihydrochloride (OCT, 0·1%) or polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB, 0·1%) was applied. Antiseptics significantly reduced MSSA (1-4 log10  CFU/explants) after 0·25 h to 4 h. CHG, PHMB and OCT exhibited persistence at 24 h. In broth culture, CHG 0·012% and PI 0·625% achieved >6 log10 reductions at 2 h. PI-based formulations were more efficacious than unformulated PI. PI-based formulations exhibited no significant cytotoxicity on explants using an MTT assay. CONCLUSIONS: All antiseptics tested in the mucosal MSSA infection model reduced MSSA. CHG and PI were more potent in broth culture. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: We developed a semi-high-throughput mucosal model that can identify compounds or formulations with promising antimicrobial and limited cytotoxic properties. "
"Abstract: Ondansetron, selective serotonin (5-HT3) receptor blocker, is used in treating chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting in cancer patients. Mouth dissolving films containing ondansetron were developed to have better onset and patient compliances. The drug content of prepared films was within 85%-115%. The films were found to be stable for 4 months when stored at 40 %°C and 75% RH. In-vitro dissolution studies suggested a rapid disintegration, in which most of ondansetron was released (91.5±3.4%) within 90 sec. Subsequently, Sprague-Dawley rats were used to compare pharmacokinetic parameters of the formulated films with oral administration of pure drug solution. Pharmacokinetic parameters were similar between the two groups in which AUC0-t (ng h/ml), AUC0-∞ (ng h/ml), Cmax (ng/ml), Tmax (min), Kel (h(-1)) and t1/2 (h) of reference was 109.091±15.73, 130.32±18.56, 28.5±4.053, 60, 0.1860±0.0226, and 3.771±0.498 respectively; and for formulated film 113.663±16.64, 151.79±16.54, 30±3.51, 60, 0.1521±0.0310 and 4.755±0.653 respectively. These results suggest that the fast dissolving film containing ondansetron is likely to become one of the choices to treat chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting. "
"Abstract: Robust and flexible free-standing polymer films for unidirectional drug delivery are fabricated by sandwiching drug-containing polyelectrolyte multilayer films between poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) barrier and capping layers. The drug-containing films are fabricated by layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of chemically cross-linked poly(allylamine hydrochloride)-dextran (PAH-D) microgel and hyaluronic acid (HA), which can load negatively charged cancer-inhibiting drug, methotrexate (MTX). Because the PLGA barrier layer effectively blocks MTX release, MTX can be predominantly released from the PLGA capping layer of the free-standing film. This increases the efficacy of released MTX to cancer cells while minimizing its side effects on the normal tissues. We believe that the unidirectional drug delivery free-standing films can open a new avenue to design of highly efficient drug delivery systems for biomedical application. "
"BACKGROUND: Current pharmacotherapy for allergic rhinitis (AR) does not totally ameliorate all symptoms for all patients. Residual symptoms could be due to nasal neuronal hyperresponsiveness caused by stimulation of the ion channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1). SB-705498 is a TRPV1 antagonist that has been developed in an intranasal formulation for treatment of AR. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, 3-way incomplete block crossover study evaluated the effects of 8 days treatment with SB-705498 12 mg alone, SB-705498 12 mg plus fluticasone propionate 200 μg (FP), FP 200 μg alone or placebo on allergen-induced symptoms in 70 patients with AR. The primary endpoint was total nasal symptom score (TNSS), expressed as mean over 4 hours or maximum TNSS during allergen challenge in the Vienna Challenge Chamber on 8th day of treatment. RESULTS: At the end of treatment, there were no differences in allergen-induced mean TNSS between SB-705498 alone and placebo or between SB-705498 plus FP and FP alone. Treatment with FP and SB-705498 plus FP resulted in a significant decrease in TNSS vs. placebo. Mean (90% CI) treatment differences in TNSS over 0 - 4 hours were: SB-705498 - placebo: -0.2 (-0.9, 0.4); SB-705498 plus FP - FP: 0.7 (0.2, 1.2); FP - placebo: -2.9 (-3.4, -2.5); SB-705498 plus FP - placebo: -2.3 (-2.8, -1.8). SB-705498 had no impact on diary card symptoms, nasal airflow or Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire scores. SB-705498 was well tolerated and pharmacokinetics exposure results supported the dosing regimen. CONCLUSION: SB-705498 12 mg for 8 days did not alleviate the allergen-induced symptoms of AR, or provide additional relief of symptoms when in combination with FP. Despite engagement of the TRPV1 receptor there was no translation to clinical efficacy, suggesting redundancy in symptom pathways. "
"Abstract: Overcoming the intractable challenge of imaging of label-free, drug encapsulated nanoparticles in tissues in vivo would directly address associated regulatory concerns over 'nanotoxicology'. Here we demonstrate the utility of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) for visualising label-free, drug encapsulated polyester particles of ∼280 nm distributed within tissues following their intravenous or peroral administration to rodents. A surprising phenomenon, in which the tissues' mechanical stiffness was directly measured (also by AFM) and related to the number of embedded nanoparticles, was utilised to generate quantitative data sets for nanoparticles localisation. By coupling the normal determination of a drug's pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics with post-sacrifice measurement of nanoparticle localisation and number, we present for the first time an experimental design in which a single in vivo study relates the PK/PD of a nanomedicine to its toxicokinetics.

"Abstract: During the last years, the EU market is flooded by illegal cosmetics via the Internet and a so-called ""black market"". Among these, skin-bleaching products represent an important group. They contain, according to the current European cosmetic legislation (Directive 76/768/EEC), a number of illegal active substances including hydroquinone, tretinoin and corticosteroids. These may provoke as well local as systemic toxic effects, being the reason for their banning from the EU market. To control this market there is a need for a fast screening method capable of detecting illegal ingredients in the wide variety of existing bleaching cosmetic formulations. In this paper the development and validation of an ultra high pressure liquid chromatographic (UHPLC) method is described. The proposed method makes use of a Waters Acquity BEH shield RP18 column with a gradient using 25 mM ammonium borate buffer (pH 10) and acetonitrile. This method is not only able to detect the major illegal (hydroquinone, tretinoin and six dermatologic active corticosteroids) and legal whitening agents, the latter having restrictions with respect to concentration and application (kojic acid, arbutin, nicotinamide and salicylic acid), but can also quantify these in a run time of 12 min. The method was successfully validated using the ""total error"" approach in accordance with the validation requirements of ISO-17025. During the validation a variety of cosmetic matrices including creams, lotions and soaps were taken into consideration. "
"INTRODUCTION: Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) has been used as fungicide, but oral DMF activates anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative pathways that are beneficial in the treatment of psoriasis. BG-12, a specific formulation of DMF, has been approved very recently for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), which is characterized by both autoimmune lymphocytes leading to inflammation and mitochondrial alterations associated with oxidative stress. AREAS COVERED: This review describes the pharmacokinetics and the mode of action of DMF, with a focus on molecular and cellular pathways, and discusses clinical results of DMF in RRMS treatment. To identify relevant publications, the author searched the PubMed database by using appropriate keywords and by searching for references cited within the obtained articles. EXPERT OPINION: DMF demonstrated efficacy in several RRMS outcome measures related to disease activity and severity, but results on disability progression have been inconsistent. The overall safety profile might qualify DMF for long-term use, the frequency of side effects such as gastrointestinal complaints and flushing might hamper treatment adherence of MS patients. Since DMF covalently binds to intracellular proteins, the fate of this molecule in the body might need thorough long-term observation during clinical use. "
"Abstract: Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy can have serious adverse effects on the quality of a woman's life, affecting her occupational, social, and domestic functioning, and her general well-being; therefore, it is very important to treat this condition appropriately and effectively. Evidence-based algorithms support the use of oral pyridoxine alone or combined with doxylamine as first-line treatment. Promethazine or dimenhydrinate, known as a second-line treatment, should be added to the first-line treatment or should be added only to pyridoxine according to different algorithms. In most of the world, there is a lack of approved medicines using this combination approach known as the first-line treatment. Therefore, compounding pharmacists should supply the demand by compounding 10-mg pyridoxine hydrochloride and 10-mg doxylamine succinate slow-release capsules. Since transdermal promethazine does not exist world wide, and, since this medicine has significant added values compared to the oral/rectal dosage forms, compounding pharmacists should offer physicians transdermal promethazine as a second-line therapy in nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. This review summarizes the nausea and vomiting in pregnancy problems and discusses the compounding opportunities that exist in this common and wide-spread pathology in order to improve a woman's quality of life.

"Abstract: Facial angiofibromas are dermatological manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex, a neurocutaneous disorder characterized by excess cell growth and proliferation. Oral rapamycin has been used to treat visceral tuberous sclerosis-related tumors; however, the side effect profile of this medicine precludes its routine use in patients lacking significant internal involvement. The authors formulated a novel rapamycin cream that is easy to compound and apply, does not cause local or systemic side effects, and results in a dramatic improvement of facial angiofibromas. "
"Abstract: Azelaic acid (AzA) is used in the treatment of acne. However, side effects and low compliance have been associated with several topical treatments with AzA. Nanotechnology presents a strategy that can overcome these problems. Polymeric nanoparticles can control drug release and targeting and reduce local drug toxicity. The aim of this study was to produce and evaluate an innovative topical treatment for acne with AzA-loaded poly-DL-lactide/glycolide copolymer nanoparticles. A soft white powder of nanoparticles was prepared. The mean size of loaded nanoparticles was < 400 nm and zeta potential was negative. Spherical nanoparticles were observed by scanning electron microscopy. Encapsulation efficiency was around 80% and a strong interaction between the polymer and the drug was confirmed by differential scanning calorimetric analysis. In vitro drug release studies suggested a controlled and pulsatile release profile. System efficacy tests suggested similar results between the loaded nanoparticles and the nonencapsulated drug against the most common bacteria associated with acne. Cytotoxicity of AzA-loaded nanoparticles was concentration dependent, although not pronounced. The occluded patch test seemed to indicate that the formulation excipients were safe and thus AzA-loaded nanoparticles appear to be an efficient and safe treatment for acne. "
"BACKGROUND: Hydrogen peroxide is a common household product. It is clear and odorless making it easy to confuse with water, especially when improperly stored. Concentrated formulations are also available for consumer purchase. OBJECTIVE: We report a case of hydrogen peroxide ingestion in a child and discuss the potential consequences and treatment of such an exposure. CASE REPORT: A 12-year-old boy accidentally ingested a sip of concentrated hydrogen peroxide. He rapidly developed hematemesis and presented to the Emergency Department. His initial work-up was unremarkable, and his symptoms resolved quickly. However, diffuse gas emboli were found within the portal system on abdominal computed tomography. The child was treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy and later found to have gastric irritation as well as an ulcer on endoscopy. He recovered fully from the incident. CONCLUSIONS: We present this case to increase awareness of the dangers of hydrogen peroxide ingestion in children. Fortunately, the child in this case recovered fully, but emergency physicians should be aware of the potential consequences and therapeutic options. "
"BACKGROUND: Photoaged skin is characterized by a variety of clinical, histologic, and biochemical features. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of a new topical formulation of 1% retinol and the effects of this same formulation using a 0.5% retinol concentration to minimize irritation. METHODS: Patients at 2 sites (n=6, n=5) with photodamaged skin applied a novel suspension of retinol (1%) daily to their faces for 8 to 12 weeks. Clinicians graded improvement in ultraviolet-induced features at 4 to 6 weeks and at 8 to 12 weeks. Positive results of the observational pilot study warranted a follow-up study on the low concentration. At a third site, females (n=30) with facial photodamage applied the same formulation with or without retinol (0.5%) daily for 8 weeks. Twenty-two subjects applied the test product and 8 applied vehicle according to a randomized, double-blinded, institutional review board-approved protocol. Improvements in photodamage features were graded at 4 and 8 weeks. RESULTS: In the observational pilot study, most participants showed improvement in overall photodamage, crow's feet, elasticity,wrinkles, brightness, and hyperpigmentation at 60 to 80 days. Improvements at 60 to 80 days were greater than at 30 to 46 days. In the low-concentration study with 0.5% retinol, improvements were modest, most likely due to the lower retinol concentration. Burning, pruritus, dryness, and erythema were minimal with the 0.5% retinol concentration. CONCLUSIONS: The topical formulation of 1% retinol improves photodamaged skin for at least 8 to 12 weeks. Although improvements with the 0.5% retinol were more modest, side effects such as burning, dryness, pruritus, and erythema during the 8-week study period were minimal. These encouraging results justify a longer-term study to determine whether topically applied 0.5% retinol can provide benefits comparable with those seen with topically applied 1% retinol. "
"BACKGROUND: Tazarotene 0.1% gel and cream are effective topical treatments for acne. Tazarotene foam, 0.1% was developed to provide an alternative, safe, and effective formulation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and tolerability of tazarotene foam, 0.1% in adults and adolescents with acne vulgaris. METHODS: Two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group studies were conducted at 39 centers in the United States and Canada. The first study involved 744 participants and the second 742, aged 12 to 45 years, who were randomized to receive treatment with either tazarotene foam, 0.1% or vehicle foam once daily for 12 weeks. Lesion counts, Investigator's Static Global Assessments (ISGA), and Subject's Global Assessments (SGA) were evaluated at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. Tolerability was monitored throughout the study. RESULTS: At week 12 in both studies, treatment with tazarotene foam led to greater decreases from baseline in mean absolute and percentage change in lesion counts (noninflammatory, inflammatory, and total), greater proportion of participants with ≥2-grade improvement in ISGA score, and greater proportion of participants with ISGA score of 0 or 1 than vehicle treatment (P<.001 for all). Only application-site skin irritation and dryness were reported by >5% of participants in active treatment groups in both studies. LIMITATIONS: The efficacy and tolerability of tazarotene foam were not compared directly with those of other formulations. CONCLUSION: Tazarotene foam, 0.1% significantly reduced the number and severity of acne lesions after 12 weeks and had a safe and acceptable tolerability profile. "
"Abstract: Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms in palliative care. Haloperidol is often used as an antiemetic in this context, although direct evidence supporting this practice is limited. To evaluate the efficacy and clinical use of haloperidol as an antiemetic in nonpalliative care contexts to inform practice, the authors conducted a rapid review of (i) published evidence to supplement existing systematic reviews, and (ii) practical aspects affecting the use of haloperidol including formulations and doses that are commonly available internationally. In nausea and vomiting related to cancer treatment, haloperidol was superior to control in two small studies. In postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), two randomized controlled trials found treatment with haloperidol comparable to ondansetron. In palliative care, an observational study found a complete response rate of 24% with haloperidol (one in four patients) which would be consistent with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 3 to 5 derived from PONV. There remains insufficient direct evidence to definitively support the use of haloperidol for the management of nausea and vomiting in palliative care. However, generalizing evidence from other clinical contexts may have some validity. "
"BACKGROUND: New-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) occurs commonly. Prior NODAT definitions have been inconsistent. Based on the American Diabetic Association criteria, we propose a new approach to defining NODAT. METHODS: Analysis of 1416 at-risk transplant recipients was performed. Data from three de novo Astellas registration transplant studies (two kidney and one liver) evaluated NODAT in 634 at-risk patients receiving tacrolimus, 630 at-risk patients receiving tacrolimus extended release, and 152 at-risk patients receiving cyclosporine. NODAT was defined as a composite endpoint consisting of first occurrence of one of four parameters: (i) two fasting plasma glucose levels ≥ 126 mg/dL (≥ 7.0 mmol/L) ≥ 30 days apart, (ii) oral hypoglycemic agent use for ≥ 30 consecutive days, (iii) insulin therapy for ≥ 30 consecutive days, and (iv) hemoglobin A1c ≥ 6.5%. We evaluated each of the above parameters, as well as the composite endpoint, in an attempt to establish an appropriate clinical approach to the diagnosis of NODAT. RESULTS: The composite definition results in a 1-year NODAT incidence of 30% to 37% in kidney and 44% to 45% in liver transplant recipients treated with tacrolimus. NODAT incidence was significantly higher with tacrolimus than cyclosporine; there was no difference between the two tacrolimus formulations. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these analyses, the proposed composite definition for NODAT, incorporating broader criteria, is recommended for clinical trials. Appropriate definitions of NODAT allow for a better understanding of the incidence of this complication and may result in earlier initiation of therapy with improved long-term outcomes. "

"Abstract: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of a sunscreen formulation on the skin of albino hairless mice subjected to simulated solar light (SSL) in terms of morphological changes. Young adult albino hairless mice HRS/J (n = 36) were used as an experimental model for determining skin photoaging changes. Mice were irradiated with SSL, and the sunscreen (estimated SPF 30, PF-UVA) was obtained from the Pharmacy College/UFRJ, Brazil. The animals were divided into four groups: non-treated (G1), radiation only (G2), sunscreen-treated (G3) and vehicle + radiation (G4). Animals from groups G2, G3 and G4 were irradiated weekly (5 weeks), with no immobilization. One week after the final exposure, the dorsal skin was observed using a dermatoscopic camera. Biopsies were analyzed in order to quantify neovascularization and to evaluate histological aspects of the skin. Neovascularization was also evaluated with immunohistochemical reactions for the Von Willebrand factor. Animals from G2 displayed classical morphological changes denoting skin photoaging: thickening of the epidermis, increased dermal cellularity, follicular keratosis, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, and angiogenesis. Animals from groups G3 and G1 displayed similar morphological profiles, without these changes. Animals from group G4 showed more morphological changes than group G2, emphasizing the relative importance of the putative photosensitizing components present in the vehicle formulation. The extent of the morphological skin changes suggested that the sunscreen formulation was effective against SSL, and showed the importance of assessing the phototoxicity of vehicle formulations. "
"OBJECTIVE: To describe the long-term effects (10 years) of the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) formulation of high-dose antioxidants and zinc supplement on progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, controlled, clinical trial followed by an epidemiologic follow-up study. PARTICIPANTS: We enrolled 4757 participants with varying severity of AMD in the clinical trial; 3549 surviving participants consented to the follow-up study. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to antioxidants C, E, and β-carotene and/or zinc versus placebo during the clinical trial. For participants with intermediate or advanced AMD in 1 eye, the AREDS formulation delayed the progression to advanced AMD. Participants were then enrolled in a follow-up study. Eye examinations were conducted with annual fundus photographs and best-corrected visual acuity assessments. Medical histories and mortality were obtained for safety monitoring. Repeated measures logistic regression was used in the primary analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Photographic assessment of progression to, or history of treatment for, advanced AMD (neovascular [NV] or central geographic atrophy [CGA]), and moderate visual acuity loss from baseline (≥15 letters). RESULTS: Comparison of the participants originally assigned to placebo in AREDS categories 3 and 4 at baseline with those originally assigned to AREDS formulation at 10 years demonstrated a significant (P<0.001) odds reduction in the risk of developing advanced AMD or the development of NV AMD (odds ratio [OR], 0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-0.83 and OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47-0. 78, respectively). No significant reduction (P = 0.93) was seen for the CGA (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.71-1.45). A significant reduction (P = 0.002) for the development of moderate vision loss was seen (OR 0.71; 95% CI, 0.57-0.88). No adverse effects were associated with the AREDS formulation. Mortality was reduced in participants assigned to zinc, especially death from circulatory diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Five years after the clinical trial ended, the beneficial effects of the AREDS formulation persisted for development of NV AMD but not for CGA. These results are consistent with the original recommendations that persons with intermediate or advanced AMD in 1 eye should consider taking the AREDS formulation. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): The authors have no proprietary or commercial interest in any of the materials discussed in this article. "
"Abstract: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory skin disease commonly affecting children and managed by pediatricians, primary care physicians, allergists, and dermatologists alike. For many years, the only available topical pharmacological treatment was topical corticosteroids. This changed in 2000-2001, when topical formulations of two calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and pimecrolimus) were approved for short-term or chronic intermittent treatment of AD in patients ≥ 2 years of age, in whom other treatments have been ineffective or contraindicated. These topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) quickly became a popular treatment option due at least in part to concerns over adverse events associated with prolonged topical corticosteroid use, especially in children. However, based on theoretical concerns about a possible risk of lymphoma associated with TCI use, a Boxed Warning was placed on both products in 2006. Since then, despite an extensive body of evidence, no causal relationship has been demonstrated between TCI use and an increased risk of lymphoma; however, the US FDA has concluded that a link cannot be ruled out. In fact, based on post-marketing surveillance of spontaneous, literature, and solicited reports, we report here that the lymphoma incidence in the topical pimecrolimus-exposed population is up to approximately 54-fold less than that seen in the general US population. This review summarizes the mechanism of action of TCIs, the factors that prompted the Boxed Warning, and recent TCI safety and efficacy data. Based on these data, both topical corticosteroids and TCIs should have defined roles in AD management, with TCIs favored for sensitive skin areas (e.g., face) and instances where topical corticosteroids have proven ineffective, thereby minimizing the risk of adverse effects with both drug classes. "
"Abstract: Since the first successful topical glucocorticosteroid, compound F, was applied to human skin to treat eczematous dermatitis approximately 60 years ago, several advances have been made in the development of topical corticosteroid (TC) compounds and vehicle formulations. The ability to apply a TC and improve skin disease revolutionized dermatologic therapy and has proven to be one of the biggest advances in the history of dermatology. The potency of a TC and their vehicle formulation can vary among brand and generic TC compounds, which can sometimes confound the clinical situation as one brand or generic formulation of a TC may be well tolerated while another generic formulation induced skin irritation or allergenicity in a patient who previously encountered no difficulties. "
"Abstract: Tazarotene is a synthetic retinoid that, depending on the concentration and vehicle, is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris (AV) and plaque psoriasis. Tazarotene is also used as adjunctive treatment for specified clinical manifestations of chronically photodamaged skin (facial fine wrinkling, mottled facial hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation, and benign facial lentigines), along with comprehensive skin care and photoprotection from sunlight. The gel formulation was released in the United States in 1997, with the cream formulation made available in 2000. Multiple studies are available supporting the effective and safe use of topical tazarotene for each of its indications. This article provides an overview of the pharmacology of topically applied tazarotene, discussing in particular up-to-date information on the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of topical tazarotene for AV, including monotherapy and combination therapy studies. Topical tazarotene 0.1% in both formulations is highly effective in reducing both inflammatory and noninflammatory acne lesions, and can be used in combination with other topical agents, including formulations containing benzoyl peroxide or dapsone 5% gel. Although many patients tolerate the use of topical tazarotene without significant issues or concerns, some patients experience application-site tolerability reactions, which can usually be managed with proper skin care and are less frequent with the cream formulation.

"Abstract: There are numerous common skin disorders involving hyperpigmentation, including solar lentigines, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, melasma, freckles, and dyschromia from photoaging. While these conditions are of an aesthetic nature, there is great interest in newer, safer, and more effective treatment modalities. Topical hydroquinone (HQ) has been the gold standard of skin lighteners for many years. However, regulatory authorities around the world are now questioning its safety. A randomized, double-blind, half-face study was conducted in females with moderate to severe facial hyperpigmentation to assess the efficacy and tolerability of 3 new skin brightener formulations containing SMA-432, a prostaglandin E2 inhibitor, compared with 4% HQ. Each subject was assigned 2 of the 4 test materials and was instructed to apply the product on the assigned side of the face twice daily for 12 weeks. Evaluation visits were conducted at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. At each visit, subjects were evaluated by a blinded investigator for clinical efficacy and tolerability using grading scales. Standardized digital photography and Chroma Meter assessments were also taken. Self-assessment questionnaires were completed at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Sixty-eight Caucasian subjects (136 half faces) completed the study. All test materials significantly reduced Overall Hyperpigmentation and improved the Investigator's Global Hyperpigmentation Improvement rating at weeks 4, 8, and 12 compared with baseline. SMA-432 exhibited a dose-dependent improvement in hyperpigmentation. There were no major tolerability issues with any of the test materials. Self-assessments were generally favorable for all test materials. At the completion of the trial, subjects rated one of the tested multimodality brightener compositions as the most favorable product and 4% HQ as the least favorable. This study demonstrated that the new non-HQ-containing skin brightener formulations were as effective and equally well tolerated as the gold standard, 4% HQ, in females with facial hyperpigmentation.

"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Skin lightening preparations are used by people all over the world for a diverse range of dermatologic indications. Hydroquinone (HQ) is the gold standard and remains the only prescription product available in the United States for the treatment of generalized facial hyperpigmentation. Irritation and the risk of exogenous ochronosis are the main adverse effects for concern. Therefore, there has been a constant search for new treatment alternatives. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in pigmentation has resulted in the development of a series of formulations that utilize a multimodal treatment approach. These proprietary formulas combine skin lightening agents that act via different mechanisms of action. The actives included 4-ethoxybenzaldehyde (anti-inflammatory and prostaglandin E2 suppressor), licorice extract (tyrosinase inhibitor), tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate (antioxidant), niacinamide (melanosome transport inhibitor), ethyl linoleate (tyrosinase inhibitor; enhances turnover of epidermis), hexylresorcinol (tyrosinase inhibitor), and retinol (tyrosinase transcription inhibitor; enhances turnover of epidermis). METHODS: Select formulations were tested in several studies using the MelanoDerm™ Skin Model (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA) to assess the ability of the product to reduce melanin production and distribution. A single-center, double-blind comparison clinical study of 18 subjects was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the product in reducing ultraviolet-induced hyperpigmentation. Test sites were irradiated with 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 minimal erythema doses. After 5 days, to allow for pigmentation development, the product or 4% HQ cream was applied to the respective test sites, once daily for 4 weeks. Chroma Meter measurements (L* brightness) and standardized digital photographs were taken of the test sites twice a week. RESULTS: The test product resulted in greater reduction in melanin as measured by melanin content and histological staining compared with the positive control in the MelanoDerm Skin Model. The product also demonstrated statistically significant reductions in pigmentation compared with baseline (all P ≤.0001) at the end of the clinical study, and produced greater increases in L*, compared with 4% HQ. Results from these studies indicate that a product designed to affect multiple pathways of melanogenesis and melanin distribution may provide an additional treatment option beyond HQ for hyperpigmentation.

"Abstract: While the clinical attributes of photoaging are well characterized in the literature, the pathogenic mechanisms that underlie these changes are incompletely elucidated. At the molecular level, p53 tumor-suppressor gene product mediated excision repair of ultraviolet (UV)-induced DNA damage is a critical effector in xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and potentially in conventional photoaging. We examined p53 activity and measured UV-induced DNA damage via cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) quantitatively in 20 volunteers before and after an 8-week, open-label prospective topical application of a proprietary DNA recovery serum (Celfix). There was a statistically significant decrease in immunohistochemically determined p53 and CPD levels. While these data are preliminary, the findings lend support to the theoretical possibility of a topical agent reversing the effects of photodamage at the molecular level and, potentially, an ameliorative outcome clinically.

"INTRODUCTION: Although the skin provides a natural physical barrier against particle penetration, there are opportunities to deliver therapeutic agents through this barrier. With rapid developments in materials science, pharmaceutics, and biotechnology, new systems have emerged for topical glucocorticoids (TG) delivery. Despite being a mature class of drugs, TG are still the most frequently prescribed drugs by dermatologists, explaining the interest on this field. AREAS COVERED: Over the years, research has focused on strategies to optimize the potency of steroids while minimizing adverse effects. Several attempts have been made to increase the safety of TG treatment, including new application schedules, special vehicles, and new synthesized agents. This paper gives an overview on the conventional and advanced vehicles used to deliver TG, including strategies to improve the delivery and accumulation of TG. The therapeutic advantages of TG delivery to the epidermis are discussed with a special focus on new drug-delivery systems for topical application. EXPERT OPINION: New technologies have been developed for TG delivery, and studies are currently underway in order to obtain improved benefit/risk ratio. A rationale development approach that integrates simple formulations would help to develop vehicles with these features. "
"Abstract: Lead poisoning is a global environmental disease that induces lifelong adverse health effects. The effect of a milk formula consisting of antioxidant of bamboo leaves (AOB), vitamin C (Vc), calcium lactate (CaLac), ferrous sulfate (FeSO₄) and zinc sulfate (ZnSO₄) on the reduction of lead and lead-induced oxidative damage in lead-exposed mice was studied. The lead-reducing effect of milk formula was investigated via a 7-week toxicokinetics study and a tissue distribution level examination. The ameliorating effect of milk formula on lead-induced oxidative damage was investigated. Results demonstrated current milk formula could effectively reduce blood lead levels (BLLs) and lead distribution levels of liver, kidneys, thighbones and brain in mice based on metal ion-mediated antagonism and chelation mechanisms. This milk formula could not only protect lead-susceptible tissues against lead poisoning, but also maintain normal absorption and distribution of essential elements in vivo. Meanwhile, current milk formula could prevent the reduction of δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (δ-ALAD) activity and enhancement of free erythrocyte protoporphyrins (FEP) levels in blood erythrocytes of mice. Also, this formula could indirectly protect blood cell membranes against lead-induced lipid peroxidation. We conclude that current optimized milk formula effectively reduces lead poisoning and lead-induced in vivo oxidative damage in lead-exposed mice. "
"BACKGROUND: Moisturizers are often used to overcome dry skin conditions. However, cosmetic moisturizers may lack in efficiency and may also deteriorate skin barrier function. The objective of this study was to generate data on a new humectant-rich formulation (15% alfahydroxy acids and 15% urea) in the treatment of normal skin as well as in dry feet with hyperkeratosis and cracked skin with fissures. Changes in permeability and effectiveness of the product after once- and twice-daily applications to the feet will be monitored. METHODS: The study was randomized, bilateral, controlled and evaluator-blind. The first part of the study included 12 healthy volunteers and the second part 50 patients with hyperkeratotic feet. The changes in the skin was evaluated by an expert, the patients and using non-invasive biophysical measurements of skin barrier function (transepidermal water loss, TEWL), erythema, thickness (ultrasound) and hydration (conductance). RESULTS: The humectant-rich formulation increased skin hydration, removed scales and reduced thickness of hyperkeratotic skin. Skin barrier function was improved in normal skin, but no changes in TEWL were noted in the feet. No difference between once and twice-daily applications was found. Some smarting and stinging was noted. CONCLUSION: The humectant-rich formulation efficiently relieved the xerosis on the feet without inducing any weakening of the skin barrier function. Instead the normal skin became more resistant to external insults by the treatment. "
"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate a formulation made of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles containing azelaic acid for potential acne treatment. METHODS: Azelaic acid-loaded PLGA nanoparticles were prepared by spontaneous emulsification processes using poloxamer 188 as stabilizer. Several manufacturing parameters such as stirring rate, concentration of stabilizer and different recovery methods were investigated. Nanoparticles were evaluated in terms of size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, release kinetics and permeation kinetics in vitro. Furthermore, in vitro toxicological studies were performed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae model. RESULTS: The results showed that by adjusting some formulation conditions it was possible to obtain nanoparticles with high loading and a controlled drug release. Freeze-dried recovery altered the nanoparticles structure by enhancing porous structures and mannitol was required to control the mean particle size. The centrifugation recovery was found to be the best approach to nanoparticles recovery. Similar toxicity profiles were observed for both drug-free and azelaic acid-loaded nanoparticles, with concentration-dependent decreases in cell viability. CONCLUSION: These results indicate a potential formulation for controlled release delivery of azelaic acid to the follicular unit. "
"Abstract: The aim of this double-blinded, vehicle-controlled study was to test the antipruritic efficacy of topical strontium to relieve a nonhistaminergic form of itch that would be clinically relevant for chronic pruritic diseases. Itch induced with cowhage is mediated by PAR2 receptors which are considered to play a major role in itch of atopic dermatitis and possibly other acute and chronic pruritic conditions. The topical strontium hydrogel formulation (TriCalm®) was tested in a head-to-head comparison with 2 common topical formulations marketed as antipruritics: hydrocortisone and diphenhydramine, for their ability to relieve cowhage-induced itch. Topically-applied strontium salts were previously found to be effective for reducing histamine-induced and IgE-mediated itch in humans. However, histamine is not considered the critical mediator in the majority of skin diseases presenting with chronic pruritus. The current study enrolled 32 healthy subjects in which itch was induced with cowhage before and after skin treatment with a gel containing 4% SrCl2, control vehicle, topical 1% hydrocortisone and topical 2% diphenhydramine. Strontium significantly reduced the peak intensity and duration of cowhage-induced itch when compared to the control itch curve, and was significantly superior to the other two over-the-counter antipruritic agents and its own vehicle in antipruritic effect. We hereby show that a 4% topical strontium formulation has a robust antipruritic effect, not only against histamine-mediated itch, but also for non-histaminergic pruritus induced via the PAR2 pathway, using cowhage.

"Abstract: Photofrin® (porfimer sodium) is a photosensitive reagent used for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of tumors and dysplasias. Because only photo-irradiated sites are damaged, PDT is less invasive than systemic treatments. However, a photosensitive reaction is a major side effect of systemically delivered Photofrin. To enhance localization of Photofrin to tumors, we have formulated Photofrin with the tumor-localizing graft copolymer poly(ethylene glycol)-grafted poly(l-lysine), PLL-g-PEG. We demonstrate that Photofrin preferentially interacts with PLL-g-PEG through both ionic and hydrophobic interactions. The serum competitive study showed that the highly PEG-grafted PLL is better for preventing serum binding to the Photofrin/PLL-g-PEG complex. In tumor-bearing mice, formulation of Photofrin with PLL-g-PEG enhanced tumor localization of Photofrin as twice as Photofrin alone and concomitantly suppressed the photosensitivity reaction drastically.

"BACKGROUND: Topical creams with capsaicin are used to treat peripheral neuropathic pain. Following application to the skin capsaicin causes enhanced sensitivity, followed by a period with reduced sensitivity and, after repeated applications, persistent desensitisation. High-concentration (8%) capsaicin patches were developed to increase the amount of capsaicin delivered; rapid delivery was thought to improve tolerability because cutaneous nociceptors are 'defunctionalised' quickly. The single application avoids noncompliance. Only the 8% patch formulation of capsaicin is available, with a capsaicin concentration about 100 times greater than conventional creams.High-concentration topical capsaicin is given as a single patch application to the affected part. It must be applied under highly controlled conditions, normally under local anaesthetic, due to the initial intense burning sensation it causes. The benefits are expected to last for about 12 weeks, when another application might be made. OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of topically applied, high-concentration (8%) capsaicin in chronic neuropathic pain in adults. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and clinicaltrials.gov to December 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of at least six weeks' duration, using topical capsaicin to treat neuropathic pain. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and validity, and extracted data on numbers of participants with pain relief (clinical improvement) after at least six weeks, and with local skin reactions. We calculated risk ratio and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) and harm (NNH). We sought details of definition of pain relief and specific adverse events.Efficacy outcomes reflecting long-duration pain relief after a single drug application were from the patient global impression of change (PGIC) at specific points, usually eight and 12 weeks. We regarded these outcomes as first-tier evidence. We regarded average pain scores over weeks 2 to 8 and 2 to 12 and the number and/or percentage of participants with pain intensity reduction of at least 30% or at least 50% over baseline as second-tier evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We included six studies, involving 2073 participants; they were of generally good reporting quality; the control was 0.04% topical capsaicin to help maintain blinding. Efficacy outcomes were inconsistently reported between studies, however, resulting in analyses for most outcomes being based on less than complete data.Four studies involved 1272 participants with postherpetic neuralgia. All efficacy outcomes were significantly better than control. At both eight and 12 weeks there was a significant benefit for high-concentration over low-concentration topical capsaicin for participants reporting themselves to be much or very much better, with point estimates of the NNTs of 8.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.3 to 26) and 7.0 (95% CI 4.6 to 15) respectively. More participants had average 2 to 8-week and 2 to 12-week pain intensity reductions over baseline of at least 30% and at least 50% with active treatment than control, with NNT values between 10 and 12.Two studies involved 801 participants with painful HIV-neuropathy. In a single study the NNT at 12 weeks for participants to be much or very much better was 5.8 (95% CI 3.8 to 12). Over both studies more participants had average 2 to 12-week pain intensity reductions over baseline of at least 30% with active treatment than control, with an NNT of 11.Local adverse events were common, but not consistently reported. Serious adverse events were no more common with active treatment (4.1%) than control (3.2%). Adverse event withdrawals did not differ between groups, but lack of efficacy withdrawals were somewhat more common with control than active treatment, based on small numbers of events. No deaths were judged to be related to study medication. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: High-concentration topical capsaicin used to treat postherpetic neuralgia and HIV-neuropathy generates more participants with high levels of pain relief than does control treatment using a much lower concentration of capsaicin. The additional proportion who benefit over control is not large, but for those who do obtain high levels of pain relief there are additional improvements in sleep, fatigue, depression and an improved quality of life. High-concentration topical capsaicin is therefore similar to other therapies for chronic pain. In this case, the high cost of single and repeated applications suggest that high-concentration topical capsaicin is likely to be used when other available therapies have failed, and that it should probably not be used repeatedly without substantial documented pain relief. Even when efficacy is established, there are unknown risks, especially on epidermal innervation, of repeated application of long periods. "
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Nasal sensory nerves play an important role in symptoms associated with rhinitis triggered by environmental stimuli. Here, we propose that TRPV1 is pivotal in nasal sensory nerve activation and assess the potential of SB-705498 as an intranasal therapy for rhinitis. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The inhibitory effect of SB-705498 on capsaicin-induced currents in guinea pig trigeminal ganglion cells innervating nasal mucosa was investigated using patch clamp electrophysiology. A guinea pig model of rhinitis was developed using intranasal challenge of capsaicin and hypertonic saline to elicit nasal secretory parasympathetic reflex responses, quantified using MRI. The inhibitory effect of SB-705498, duration of action and potency comparing oral versus intranasal route of administration were examined. KEY RESULTS: SB-705498 concentration-dependently inhibited capsaicin-induced currents in isolated trigeminal ganglion cells (pIC50 7.2). In vivo, capsaicin ipsilateral nasal challenge (0.03-1 mM) elicited concentration-dependent increases in contralateral intranasal fluid secretion. Ten per cent hypertonic saline initiated a similar response. Atropine inhibited responses to either challenge. SB-705498 inhibited capsaicin-induced responses by ∼50% at 10 mg·kg⁻¹ (oral), non-micronized 10 mg·mL⁻¹ or 1 mg·mL⁻¹ micronized SB-705498 (intranasal) suspension. Ten milligram per millilitre intranasal SB-705498, dosed 24 h prior to capsaicin challenge produced a 52% reduction in secretory response. SB-705498 (10 mg·mL⁻¹, intranasal) inhibited 10% hypertonic saline responses by 70%. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The paper reports the development of a guinea pig model of rhinitis. SB-705498 inhibits capsaicin-induced trigeminal currents and capsaicin-induced contralateral nasal secretions via oral and intranasal routes; efficacy was optimized using particle-reduced SB-705498. We propose that TRPV1 is pivotal in initiating symptoms of rhinitis. "
"Abstract: The feasibility of some mesoporous materials such as SBA-15 and MCM-41 silica, LDH (layered double hydroxide) (Mg3Al-NO3) and MC (mesoporous carbon) have been comparatively evaluated for oral drug delivery applications, in order to broaden the range of matrices and implicitly to develop the class of drug delivery systems based on diffusion mechanism. As well known, methotrexate (MTX) is used widely to treat various neoplastic diseases such as acute lymphoblast leukemia, lymphoma and solid cancers and autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. The commercially available formulations of this drug have disadvantages due to the traditional release process that occurs in the body. Thus, this work is focused on the long-term controlled MTX delivery because this one could eliminate over or underdosing, could maintain drug levels in desired range, could increase patient compliance and prevent the side effects. Therefore, the mesoporous materials are used and efficient MTX-delivery systems, based on above-mentioned mesoporous materials, are successfully prepared by intercalation. The obtained drug carriers were tested in the controlled MTX-drug release process and the influence of the pore morphology and geometry on MTX release profiles was extensively studied comparatively. The prepared MTX delivery systems were characterized by FTIR and UV-vis spectroscopy, N2 sorption measurements. Then, the data obtained from the in vitro release studies have been analyzed, and in order to evaluate the MTX-release mechanism and kinetics, the Korsmeyer-Peppas equation has been applied. "
"CONTEXT: The non-invasive ophthalmic therapy has a drawback: low residence time in the eye socket. Nanoparticles and contact lenses have been studied as promising ocular drug delivery systems. OBJECTIVE: To develop a nanoemulsion and evaluate its compatibility with a soft contact lens as a potential strategy for ocular delivery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The formulations were developed by spontaneous emulsification and fully characterized. Two drops of nanoemulsion were instilled on the surface of a commercial contact lens and its transparency was measured using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Before and after the instillation of the drops, the morphology (scanning electron microscopy - SEM) and ion permeability of the lenses were analyzed. RESULTS: The formulations had a mean particle size of 234 nm, polydispersity below 0.16, zeta potential of -8.56 ± 3.49 mV, slightly acid pH, viscosity ≈1.2 mPa s(-1) and spherical-shaped particles. Nanoemulsion was non-irritant (hen's egg test-chorioallantoic membrane), which was confirmed by the cytotoxicity studies in the SIRC cell cultures. After instillation, SEM analysis showed nanodroplets inside and on the surface of the lenses, although their transparency remained near 100%. No significant differences were found between lens ion permeability coefficients before and after instillation. CONCLUSIONS: Formulations presented appropriate physicochemical characteristics and suitability for ocular application. The contact lens remained transparent and ion-permeable after association with the formulation. "
"Abstract: The thermosensitive-mucoadhesive ondansetron liquid suppository (tmOLS) was developed to enhance patient compliance and bioavailability in high-risk patients receiving highly emetogenic therapy and having difficulty in swallowing, The thermosensitive-mucoadhesive liquid suppository bases were formulated using poloxamers (P407 and P188) and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC). The physicochemical properties of the liquid suppository bases were characterized by their gelation temperature, mucoadhesive force, rheological properties, and in vitro release. Rectal mucosal damage following rectal administration of tmOLS in rats was assessed using microscopy. Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed to compare tmOLS administered via the rectal route to ondansetron solution administered orally. The liquid suppository base of tmOLS contained P407, P188, and HPMC in the ratio 18:20:0.8, was in the liquid state at room temperature, underwent gelation at body temperature. Area under the curve and half-life (t1/2) of ondansetron were significantly higher in the tmOLS-treated group, indicating that the formulation bypassed the first-pass metabolism and that it was released slowly from the tmOLS because of the formation of mucoadhesive gel state. Furthermore, the t1/2 of tmOLS was two-fold that of the oral solution. Thus, tmOLS could be administered to patients who have difficulty in swallowing; however, adjustments in dosing interval may be needed. "
"Abstract: 1,2-Benzisothiazolin-3-one (BIT; CAS # 2634-33-5) is a preservative used in consumer products. Dermal exposure to BIT at sufficient dose and duration can produce skin sensitization and allergic contact dermatitis in animals and susceptible humans.The purpose of this study is to derive a maximal concentration of BIT in various consumer products that would result in exposures below the No Expected Sensitization Induction Level (NESIL), a dose below which skin sensitization should not occur. A screening level exposure estimate was performed for several product use scenarios with sunscreen, laundry detergent, dish soap, and spray cleaner. We calculated that BIT concentrations below the following concentrations of 0.0075%, 0.035%, 0.035%, 0.021% in sunscreen, laundry detergent, dish soap, and spray cleaner, respectively, are unlikely to induce skin sensitization. We completed a pilot study consisting of bulk sample analysis of one representative product from each category labelled as containing BIT, and found BIT concentrations of 0.0009% and 0.0027% for sunscreen and dish soap, respectively. BIT was not detected in the laundry detergent and spray cleaner products above the limit of detection of 0.0006%. Based on publically available data for product formulations and our results, we were able to establish that cleaning products and sunscreens likely contain BIT at concentrations similar to or less than our calculated maximal safe concentrations and that exposures are unlikely to induce skin sensitization in most users. "
"Abstract: The damaging effects of UVA radiation have been well-documented. UVA radiation is known to induce molecular, cellular, and clinical damage. Such harm may lead to photoaging, immune system depression, altered gene expression, or oncogene and tumor suppressor gene modulation, all of which are partly responsible for the development of skin cancer. In parallel to an increased understanding of the added damage caused by UVA radiation, progress has been made in sunscreen formulation. A variety of UVA filters are now available for formulators to combine with UVB filters to reach high-level photostable protection using a minimum concentration of active ingredients. The efficacy of products that contain these UV filter combinations usually is determined by noninvasive assessments, which cause either UVA-induced erythema or skin pigmentation. However, the biologic relevance of these end points for UVA radiation-induced skin damage is unknown. In our study, we confirm that the assessment of UVA radiation-induced gene expression in skin specimens obtained from UVA-irradiated human skin by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction is a sensitive, reliable, and robust method to prove the efficacy of 2 daily moisturizers containing broad-spectrum sunscreen. Specifically, we demonstrate in vivo that topical application of a daily moisturizer with broad-spectrum sunscreen prevents UVA radiation-induced transcriptional expression of genes that are directly linked to skin aging (ie, matrix metalloproteinase 1 [MMP-1]) and also reflect the skin's antioxidative stress defense response (ie, catalase [CAT], superoxide dismutase [SOD], glutathione peroxidase [GPx]). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the protection against UV-induced skin damage provided by products with different sun protection factor (SPF) but the same UVA protection factor (UVA-PF) is similar, which emphasizes the importance of high UVA protection to maintain unaltered essential biologic functions. These data indicate that the use of a daily moisturizer containing broad-spectrum sunscreen with a well-balanced SPF/UVA-PF ratio on a regular basis is beneficial for human skin. "
"Abstract: A novel approach for attaining reactive cotton/wool and viscose/wool prints with outstanding UV-protection functions was achieved via inclusion of certain UV-absorbers namely 4-hydroxybenzophenone and UV-SUN(®) or UV-blockers like ZnO-NPs and TiO(2)-NPs along with MCT-βCD, as a reactive additive, in the printing paste formulation using Na-alginate as a thickening agent. Experimental results reveal that the inorganic UV-blockers exhibit better UV-protection functions compared with the used UV-absorbers, and the improvement in the imparted UV-protection capacity follows the decreasing order: ZnO-NPs>TiO(2)-NPs>4-hyroxybenzopherone≥UV-SUN(®)>>none>untreated. The enhancement in UV-protection functionality is governed by the type of substrate, cotton/wool>viscose/wool, extent of modification and loading of the used nano-metal oxides or organic absorbers onto the fabric surface as well functionality and ability of the used reactive dyes to absorb the hazardous UV-B radiation. The obtained functional prints exhibited outstanding UV-protection efficiency even after 15 washing cycles. "
"BACKGROUND: Tofacitinib (CP-690,550) is a novel Janus kinase inhibitor in development as an oral formulation for the treatment of several inflammatory diseases including psoriasis. OBJECTIVES: This phase 2a study aimed to assess the efficacy, systemic safety, local tolerability and systemic pharmacokinetics of topical tofacitinib in mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis. METHODS: Two tofacitinib ointment formulations were evaluated in this multicentre, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial (NCT01246583). Seventy-one patients were randomized 2 : 1 : 2 : 1 to 2% tofacitinib ointment 1, vehicle 1, 2% tofacitinib ointment 2 and vehicle 2, each administered twice daily for 4 weeks to a single fixed 300 cm(2) treatment area containing a target plaque with or without one or more nontarget plaques and normal skin. RESULTS: The primary endpoint of percentage change from baseline in the Target Plaque Severity Score at week 4 demonstrated statistically significant improvement for ointment 1 [least squares mean (LSM) -54.4%] vs. vehicle 1 (LSM -41.5%), but not ointment 2 (LSM -24.2%) vs. vehicle 2 (LSM -17.2%). Secondary endpoints (target plaque area and Itch Severity Item) improved similarly for tofacitinib ointment vs. corresponding vehicle. Adverse event (AE) occurrence was similar across treatment groups. All AEs were mild or moderate and none were serious or led to subject discontinuation. One application-site AE (erythema) was reported. Tofacitinib mean systemic exposure was minimal and was greater for ointment 1 than for ointment 2. CONCLUSIONS: Tofacitinib ointment 1 was well tolerated and efficacious compared with vehicle for the treatment of plaque psoriasis. Further study of topical tofacitinib for psoriasis treatment is warranted. "
"Abstract: There are numerous common skin disorders involving hyperpigmentation, including solar lentigines, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, melasma, freckles, and dyschromia from photoaging. While these conditions are of an aesthetic nature, there is great interest in newer, safer, and more effective treatment modalities. Topical hydroquinone (HQ) has been the gold standard of skin lighteners for many years. However, regulatory authorities around the world are now questioning its safety. A randomized, double-blind, half-face study was conducted in females having moderate to severe facial hyperpigmentation to assess the efficacy and tolerability of 3 new skin brightener formulations containing SMA-432, a prostaglandin E2 inhibitor, compared with 4% HQ. Each subject was assigned 2 of the 4 test materials and was instructed to apply the product on the assigned side of the face twice daily for 12 weeks. Evaluation visits were conducted at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. At each visit, subjects were evaluated by a blinded investigator for clinical efficacy and tolerability using grading scales. Standardized digital photography and Chroma Meter assessments were also taken. Self-assessment questionnaires were completed at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Sixty-eight Caucasian subjects (136 half faces) completed the study. All test materials significantly reduced overall hyperpigmentation and improved the Investigator's Global Hyperpigmentation Improvement rating at weeks 4, 8, and 12 compared with baseline. SMA-432 exhibited a dose-dependent improvement in hyperpigmentation. There were no major tolerability issues with any of the test materials. Self-assessments were generally favorable for all test materials. At the completion of the trial, subjects rated one of the tested multimodality brightener compositions as the most favorable product and 4% HQ as the least favorable. This study demonstrated that the new non-HQ-containing skin brightener formulations were as effective and equally well tolerated as the gold standard, 4% HQ, in females with facial hyperpigmentation.

"Abstract: Skin aging is a multifaceted biological process characterized by the appearance of wrinkles, pigmentation irregularities, and loss of firmness. These symptoms cannot be fully addressed by any single skin care ingredient or noninvasive cosmetic procedure. A comprehensive treatment approach, including the use of clinically proven topical skin care formulations, provides optimal antiaging effects. A high-strength skin care regimen (NeoStrata® Skin Active; NeoStrata Company, Inc, Princeton, NJ) was developed to deliver a combination of more than 35% active benefit ingredients, including the. "
"BACKGROUND: The use of topical medications for acne vulgaris is often limited by their irritant properties. Newer combination preparations are available and offer convenience, but irritant potential may still be a hindrance, perhaps more so with the combination of 2 agents. Few studies have compared these formulations directly for tolerability. OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the tolerability of 2 combination topical acne products, clindamycin 1.2%-tretinoin 0.025% (CLIN/RA) gel and benzoyl peroxide 2.5%-adapalene 0.1% (BPO/ADA) gel. METHODS: CLIN/RA and BPO/ADA were applied daily to opposite sides of a subject's face for 21 days in a double-blinded fashion. Investigators' Global Assessments and study subject self-assessments of burning/stinging, itching, erythema, and dryness/scaling were collected. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was also measured as an objective measure of skin irritation. A mixed model analysis and repeated-measures analysis of variance were used to compare outcomes for both acne formulations. RESULTS: CLIN/RA produced significantly less burning/stinging than BPO/ADA (P<.001) as well as significantly less pruritus than BPO/ ADA (P<.001). BPO/ADA caused significantly more TEWL than CLIN/RA (P=.005). There was no significant difference in the amount of erythema or the amount of dryness/scaling caused by either formulation. CONCLUSION: CLIN/RA produced significantly less skin irritancy and TEWL than BPO/ADA. "
"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: A combination topical suspension/gel containing calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate has been developed as a safe and effective treatment for patients with psoriasis vulgaris of the scalp. This same preparation has the potential to be a convenient, effective, and cosmetically appealing formulation for psoriasis on the body. This trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of a topical suspension containing calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate compared with its constituent components and topical suspension vehicle in the treatment of mild to moderate psoriasis on the trunk and limbs. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, 4-arm trial in 1,152 subjects. The co-primary efficacy end points were the proportion of subjects achieving controlled disease based on the Investigators' Global Assessment of disease severity at weeks 4 and 8. Adverse events, vital signs, and clinical laboratory measurements were also assessed. RESULTS: At week 4, a greater proportion of subjects in the calcipotriene plus betamethasone group achieved controlled disease compared with subjects in the calcipotriene-only and vehicle-only treatment groups. At week 8, a statistically significantly (P<.01) greater proportion of subjects in the calcipotriene plus betamethasone group achieved controlled disease compared with subjects in the 3 other treatment groups. Adverse events and other safety assessments were similar between the groups. CONCLUSION: The topical suspension containing calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate traditionally used for scalp psoriasis is also a safe and effective once-daily treatment for psoriasis vulgaris on the body.

"Abstract: Hydroquinone (HQ) is the benchmark prescription agent for skin lightening. However, HQ use is recently banned in Europe and in parts of Asia because of potential long-term consequences, including carcinogenesis when orally consumed. This has resulted in development of alternative skin-lightening agents with comparable efficacy to HQ, but better safety profiles. This study examined the skin-lightening ability of a topical product containing 0.5% ellagic acid and 0.1% salicylic acid and compared its efficacy with that of a prescription generic 4% HQ product. Fifty-four multiethnic subjects were randomly assigned to use the topical test formulation or generic 4% HQ twice daily for 12 weeks to evaluate product tolerability and efficacy. Under the conditions of this double-blinded clinical study, the test product demonstrated comparable tolerance and efficacy to that of a benchmark product 4% HQ, as assessed by clinical grading, physical measurement of spot size using image analysis, and questionnaire response analysis. This study suggests that this new product provided comparable skin depigmentation benefit to the benchmark product. In addition, the product appears to have better esthetics (texture, pleasantness to use, skin feel) than the 4% HQ product. "
"Abstract: Methotrexate (MTX) has toxic effect to healthy tissues. Microencapsulation coats particles with a functional coat to optimize storage stability and to modulate release. In the present study, a new MTX encapsulated microcapsules were synthesized for controlling MTX release. Controlled drug release provides releasing of efficient dose and prevent drug side effect to tissues and also protects MTX from oxygen, pH and other interactions. MTX was encapsulated through biocompatible hyaluronic acid (HA) and sodium alginate (SA) with an encapsulation system to reduce its toxicity and for controlled release. The microcapsules prepared by vibrating nozzle were cross-linked with SA, HA and calcium chloride. Nozzle diameter and MTX concentration were changed according to loaded MTX and encapsulation efficiency were determined using HPLC. For the reliability of the data, validation studies of the HPLC method were performed. The precision of the method was demonstrated using intra- and inter-day assay relative standard deviation (RSD) values which are less than 2% in all instances. For the characterization of microcapsules, particle size, drug loading and in vitro drug release studies were performed. Diameters of MTX-loaded microcapsules were acquired approximately 160, 400 and 800 µm. Surface morphology of encapsulated microcapsules were displayed with light microscope. Eighty-nine percent MTX encapsulation efficiencies were achieved. Encapsulated MTX microcapsules showed controlled release when compared to pure MTX. While powder MTX dissolved completely in 10 min in the dissolution medium, MTX release from encapsulated MTX microcapsules became 40 h in 0.1 M PBS pH 7.4, including NaCl. MTX release from MTX-loaded microcapsules was reached to 79%. Moreover, drug efficiency was examined in vitro cell culture tests. Viability of 5RP7 cells were decreased to 88.5% for 96 h. When MTX was given directly to 5RP7 cells, viability of 5RP7 cells was decreased to 49.7% for 96 h. Flow cytometry studies also showed that, MTX microcapsules induced apoptosis. The goal of this study is to provide controlled release of MTX and to reduce the toxic effect of MTX. "
"Abstract: Isotretinoin (ITR) is a drug of choice in the treatment of all types of acne, including recalcitrant, severe and nodulocystic. The most widely employed route of its administration, i.e., oral intake, is reported to be associated with severe side-effects including teratogenecity, skin dryness and psychological disorders. Topical delivery, though advised for ITR, is marked with several hiccups like irritation, erythema and peeling of skin. The current studies, therefore, were embarked upon to develop ""optimized"" SLNs of ITR employing formulation by design (FbD) approach. The developed system was characterized and evaluated for skin compliance, skin transport characteristics and anti-acne potential against testosterone-induced acne in male Laca mice. The SLNs were able to transport the drug to various skin layers effectively while formed drug micro-reservoirs. The nano-colloidal systems showed marked anti-acne potential and tolerability on the mouse skin vis-à-vis the marketed product. The optimized SLNs exhibited drug entrapment of 89.49±4.1%, while the size was found to be in the nano-range (i.e., 75.3±2.4 nm). The ITR formulation was found to be stable too as per ICH guidelines. The results vouch immense promise of the optimized SLNs of ITR in reducing dermal irritation and increasing the therapeutic performance, thus resulting in an efficacious and patient-compliant formulation.

"Abstract: In this study, we propose a new solution for the nanoencapsulation of hydrophilic anticancer drug, doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX). The drug molecules are solubilized in the core of aqueous nanoreservoirs, so-called aqueous core nanocapsules (ACN) recently developed by our team, and dispersed in aqueous bulk media. Since it is well acknowledged that the nanoencapsulation of DOX has many advantages, like reducing the sides effects (e.g. cardiac toxicity), we propose through the present study a novel formulation solution for this purpose. After focusing on the formulation process for optimizing the drug encapsulation yield, the DOX-release profiles were followed up and analyzed. Different physicochemical and in vitro characterization were performed, and complement activation experiments. ACN were shown efficient to encapsulate DOX reaching yields as high as 80%, followed by a sustained release governed by a diffusion-controlled mechanism. The loaded nanocarriers showed low levels of complement activation, compatible with stealth properties. To summarize, this study brings out a new tool for the nanoencapsulation of hydrophilic anticancers and could open new doors for the administration of this particular class of drugs. "
"Abstract: Transplant recipients and other patients requiring immunosuppression with calcineurin inhibitors or their household contacts may be exposed to overdose. This study investigated the circumstances, pharmacokinetics and outcomes of overdose with cyclosporine and tacrolimus reported to the Swiss Toxicological Information Centre between 1995 and 2011. Of 145,396 reports by healthcare professionals, 28 (0.02%) concerned enteral or parenteral overdose with these calcineurin inhibitors. Thirteen (46%) were iatrogenic errors, 12 (43%) were with suicidal intent and 3 (11%) were accidental. Iatrogenic overdoses usually involved noncapsule drug formulations. Acute enteral overdoses caused symptoms in a dose-dependent fashion but were generally well tolerated; the mean multiple of patient's usual dose was 20.8 ± 28.8 for symptomatic versus 4.4 ± 3.4 for asymptomatic cases (p = 0.037). The most common symptoms were nausea, headache, somnolence, confusion, hypertension and renal impairment. In contrast, acute intravenous overdoses were often poorly tolerated and resulted in one fatality due to cerebral edema after a cyclosporine overdose. Enteral decontamination measures were performed in six cases involving oral ingestion and appeared to reduce drug absorption, as shown by pharmacokinetic calculations. In the one case where it was used, pharmacoenhancement appeared to accelerate tacrolimus clearance after intravenous overdose. "
"BACKGROUND: Two phase III trials of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with BF-200 ALA, a recently approved nanoemulsion formulation of 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) demonstrated high clearance rates in mild-to-moderate actinic keratosis (AK). The comparison to a registered methyl aminolaevulinate (MAL) cream demonstrated significantly superior total patient clearance rates. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate long-term efficacy and safety of PDT for AK 6 and 12 months after the last PDT with BF-200 ALA, MAL or placebo. METHODS: The follow-up phase (FUP) was performed with patients of two phase III studies. Both studies compared BF-200 ALA with placebo, one of the studies additionally with MAL. Overall recurrence rates and various subgroups (light source, lesion severity, lesion location, complete responders after first PDT) were assessed 6 and 12 months after the last PDT. RESULTS: Recurrence rates were similar for BF-200 ALA and MAL, with a tendency to lower recurrence rates for BF-200 ALA. The proportion of patients who were fully cleared during PDT and remained completely clear for at least 12 months after PDT were 47% for BF-200 ALA (both studies) and 36% for MAL treatment. The subgroup that was illuminated with narrow wavelength LED lamps reached 69% and 53% for BF-200 ALA (both studies, respectively) and 41% for MAL. No safety concerns were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The FUP data confirmed the high efficacy and safety of PDT with BF-200 ALA. The slightly lower recurrence rates after BF-200 ALA treatment compared with MAL treatment enhanced the better treatment outcome due to the significantly superior efficacy. "
"Abstract: Protection of crops from bacterial diseases presents a continuing challenge, mandating the development of novel agents and approaches. Photocatalysis is a process where chemically reactive oxygen species are catalytically generated by certain minerals in the presence of light. These reactive oxygen species have the capacity to destroy organic molecular structures critical to pathogen viability. In this study, the antibacterial potential of photocatalytic nanoscale titanium dioxide (TiO(2)), nanoscale TiO(2) doped (incorporation of other materials into the structure of TiO(2)) with silver (TiO(2)/Ag), and nanoscale TiO(2) doped with zinc (TiO(2)/Zn; AgriTitan) was evaluated against Xanthomonas perforans, the causal agent for bacterial spot disease of tomato. In vitro experiments on photocatalytic activity and dose dependency were conducted on glass cover slips coated with the nanoscale formulations by adding a known population of X. perforans strain Xp-F7 and illuminating the cover slips under a visible light source. TiO(2)/Ag and TiO(2)/Zn had high photocatalytic activity against X. perforans within 10 min of exposure to 3 × 10(4) lux. Greenhouse studies on naturally and artificially infected transplants treated with TiO(2)/Zn at ≈500 to 800 ppm significantly reduced bacterial spot severity compared with untreated and copper control. Protection was similar to the grower standard, copper + mancozeb. The use of TiO(2)/Zn at ≈500 to 800 ppm significantly reduced disease incidence in three of the four trials compared with untreated and copper control, and was comparable to or better than the grower standard. The treatments did not cause any adverse effects on tomato yield in any of the field trials. "
"BACKGROUND: Ciclosporin is used as an immunosuppressant in current clinical practice but recent research implies novel indications for the drug, such as neuro- and cardioprotection. The intravenous formulation currently on the market, Sandimmune(®) Injection (Sandimmune(®)), uses Cremophor(®) EL as emulsifying excipient. Cremophor(®) EL is known to cause hypersensitivity reactions in some patients, ranging from skin reactions to potentially fatal anaphylactic shock. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to assess if CicloMulsion(®), a Cremophor(®) EL-free lipid emulsion of ciclosporin for intravenous administration, is bioequivalent to Sandimmune(®), and the secondary objective was to compare the tolerability profiles of the two preparations. METHODS: This was a single-centre, open-label, subject-blind, laboratory-blind, single-dose, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence crossover study of the pharmacokinetics of two formulations of intravenous ciclosporin. Fifty-two healthy volunteer subjects were administered 5 mg/kg of each of the two formulations of ciclosporin as a 4-h intravenous infusion. The last blood sample was acquired 48 h after the end of the infusion. Bioequivalence assessments according to current guidelines were performed. RESULTS: The geometric mean ratios for CicloMulsion(®)/Sandimmune(®) (90 % confidence interval [CI]) were 0.90 (0.88, 0.92) for AUC(0-last) (area under the blood concentration-time curve from time zero to time of last measurable concentration) and 0.95 (0.92, 0.97) for C(max) (maximum blood concentration). For all additional variables analysed, the 90 % CIs were also within the accepted bioequivalence range of 0.80-1.25. One anaphylactoid and one anaphylactic reaction, both classified as serious adverse events, were reported after treatment with Sandimmune(®). No serious adverse events were recorded after treatment with CicloMulsion(®). CONCLUSION: We have assessed the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of a new Cremophor(®) EL-free lipid emulsion of ciclosporin, CicloMulsion(®), compared to Sandimmune(®). The proportion of adverse events was significantly higher for the Cremophor(®) EL-based product Sandimmune(®). We conclude that CicloMulsion(®) is bioequivalent to Sandimmune(®) and exhibits fewer adverse reactions. "
"Abstract: The increased amount of melanin leads to skin disorders such as age spots, freckles, melasma and malignant melanoma. Tyrosinase is known to be the key enzyme in melanin production. Plants and their extracts are inexpensive and rich resources of active compounds that can be utilized to inhibit tyrosinase as well as can be used for the treatment of dermatological disorders associated with melanin hyperpigmentation. Using in vitro tyrosinase inhibitory activity assay, extracts from 13 plant species from Brazilian Cerrado were evaluated. The results showed that Pouteria torta and Eugenia dysenterica extracts presented potent in vitro tyrosinase inhibition compared to positive control kojic acid. Ethanol extract of Eugenia dysenterica leaves showed significant (p<0.05) tyrosinase inhibitory activity exhibiting the IC₅₀ value of 11.88 µg/mL, compared to kojic acid (IC₅₀ value of 13.14 µg/mL). Pouteria torta aqueous extract leaves also showed significant inhibitory activity with IC₅₀ value of 30.01 µg/mL. These results indicate that Pouteria torta and Eugenia dysenterica extracts and their isolated constituents are promising agents for skin-whitening or antimelanogenesis formulations. "
"Abstract: Vitamin D production requires UVB. In turn, we have shown that vitamin D compounds reduce UV-induced damage, including inflammation, sunburn, thymine dimers, the most frequent type of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer, immunosuppression, and photocarcinogenesis. Our previous studies have shown most of the photoprotective effects by 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) occurred through the nongenomic pathway because similar protection was seen with an analog, 1α,25-dihydroxylumistrol3 (JN), which has little ability to alter gene expression and also because a nongenomic antagonist of 1,25(OH)2D3 abolished protection. In the current study, we tested whether this photoprotective effect would extend to other types of DNA damage, and whether this could be demonstrated in human ex vivo skin, as this model would be suited to pre-clinical testing of topical formulations for photoprotection. In particular, using skin explants, we examined a time course for thymine dimers (TDs), the most abundant DNA photolesion, as well as 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), which is a mutagenic DNA base lesion arising from UV-induced oxidative stress, and 8-nitroguanosine (8-NG). Nitric oxide products, known markers for chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis, are also induced by UV. This study showed that 1,25(OH)2D3 significantly reduced TD and 8-NG as early as 30min post UV, and 8-oxodG at 3h post UV, confirming the photoprotective effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 against DNA photoproducts in human skin explants. At least in part, the mechanism of photoprotection by 1,25(OH)2D3 is likely to be through the reduction of reactive nitrogen species and the subsequent reduction in oxidative and nitrosative damage. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Vitamin D Workshop'. "
"BACKGROUND: Melatonin has attracted attention because of their high antioxidant and anticarcinogenic activity. Otherwise, the use of sunscreens is recommended for patients after chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments or to prevent UV radiation-induced skin damages that may result in pre-cancerous and cancerous skin lesions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the beneficial influence of melatonin in topical sunscreen emulsions combined with three common ultraviolet filters. METHODS: After the formulation characterization in terms of rheology, stability studies were performed. Release studies let us to evaluate its mechanism of delivery and ex vivo permeation study through human skin, the amount of melatonin retained. The antioxidant activity assay was also carried out, and finally the in vivo photoprotective effect in rats was tested as transepidermal water loss and erythema formation. RESULTS: The rheological behaviour of formulations was pseudoplastic fluid, all emulsions had good physical stability. Release studies showed a trend of enhancement in melatonin release from emulsions incorporating UV filters and followed a Weibull model. Melatonin permeation was higher from the emulsion containing melatonin combined with a mixture of three ultraviolet filters (MMIX) formulation. Equally this formulation exhibited the highest radical scavenging activity. Finally the photoprotective assay showed that only skin areas treated with this formulation were statistically equivalent to the unirradiated control area. CONCLUSION: MMIX formulation would be a promising formulation for preventing the undesirable adverse effects of UV skin irradiation because melatonin not only acts as a potent antioxidant itself, but also is capable of activating an endogenous enzymatic protective system against oxidative stress.

"PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the nerve growth factor (NGF) pathway and its influence on corneal healing mechanisms in normal conditions and in an animal model of corneal denervation induced by capsaicin. METHODS: Peripheral sensory damage was induced in rat pups by subcutaneous injection of capsaicin and the effects evaluated by hot-plate test, corneal nerve count, and tear secretion. Corneal damage was induced in capsaicin-treated and -untreated rats by epithelial scraping. Healing rate; NGF pathway (NGF, tyrosine kinase A [TrkA], p75); and the stem cell marker p63 were evaluated by RT-PCR, ELISA, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. The effects of exogenous NGF administration as eye drop formulation were also tested. RESULTS: Capsaicin treatment induced a significant reduction of peripheral sensitivity, corneal innervation, tear secretion, and corneal healing rate. The ocular effects of capsaicin treatment were associated with an NGF pathway alteration. NGF eye drop treatment aided corneal healing mechanisms through a significant increase in the NGF receptors TrkA and p75, and in the stem cell marker p63. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we show that an alteration in the NGF pathway is responsible for a delay in corneal healing in an animal model of sensory denervation. Moreover, we show that NGF eye drop administration modulates corneal innervation, epithelial cell healing, and corneal stem cells. These findings may trigger further research on the role of the NGF pathway in limbal stem cell deficiency. "

"Abstract: Calcipotriol, a vitamin D analogue, and betamethasone dipropionate, a high potency corticosteroid, are complementary agents for the topical treatment of psoriasis vulgaris. Robust evidence on the efficacy and safety of their fixed combination has been provided by randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials involving more than 7000 patients with the ointment formulation in psoriasis of the body and more than 4000 patients with the gel formulation in scalp psoriasis. These trials have shown that the fixed combination ointment is more effective and better tolerated, not only than placebo, but also than calcipotriol and tacalcitol monotherapies. In addition, it has proved, in most instances, to be more effective than betamethasone and at least as well tolerated. The same applies to the gel for scalp and body psoriasis. Safety studies have excluded that repeated courses of treatment with the fixed combination for up to one year produce systemic effects. Studies have also shown that the fixed combination treatment improves quality of life to a significantly greater extent than calcipotriol, with the once daily regimen most appreciated by patients, in both active disease and recurrency. Because of the extensive evidence, American and European guidelines recommend the calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate fixed combination as first line topical treatment for mild to moderate plaque psoriasis of the body and scalp.

"OBJECTIVE: Intranasal corticosteroids are effective for allergic rhinitis and broadly used in daily clinical practice. Systemic oral corticosteroids are also known to be effective for treatment of allergic rhinitis. These topical and systemic corticosteroids are both effective formulations for allergic rhinitis, and both drugs have some side effects. When treatment formulations for allergic rhinitis are selected based on side effects, topical corticosteroids are more commonly selected than systemic steroids. Systemic corticosteroids, on the other hand, have traditionally been believed to have higher and more instantaneous therapeutic effects than those of topical corticosteroids. However, there have been few reports of direct comparisons between topical corticosteroid and systemic corticosteroid efficacy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the subjective outcomes of nasal symptom management using topical intranasal corticosteroid therapy or systemic oral corticosteroid therapy in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. We compared the efficacy of mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) to betamethasone oral tablets (BOT) for the treatment of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. METHODS: In an open label study, patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis who had intermediate-to-severe symptoms and who visited the hospital without prior treatment were allocated to 1 of 3 treatment groups (noncorticosteroid group, topical corticosteroid group, and oral corticosteroid group). Evaluation was conducted using allergy diaries that consisted of patient questionnaires. The Japanese Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (JRQLQ) was used in this study. RESULTS: Compared to only loratazine nonsteroid therapy, both MFNS 200μg once daily and BOT 0.25mg twice daily significantly reduced the total and individual symptom scores for sneezing, nasal obstruction, watery nasal discharge, and nasal itching (P<0.05). Scores for itching of the eyes were reduced slightly more in the MFNS group than in the noncorticosteriod treatment group, but the difference was not significant. CONCLUSION: MFNS and BOT have virtually equivalent effects on nasal symptoms in patients with seasonal allergies. Our study was the first direct comparison between an intranasal corticosteroid spray and a systemic oral corticosteroid for seasonal allergic rhinitis. No significant differences were found in the therapeutic effects of the topical and systemic corticosteroids tested, suggesting that topical corticosteroids are expected to sufficiently improve nasal symptoms without administration of oral corticosteroids. Treatment with intranasal corticosteroid spray is more strongly recommended than treatment with systemic corticoid steroids, due to the side effects associated with each treatment. "
"BACKGROUND: Salicylic acid was recently formulated in a hydroethanolic vehicle at a concentration of 20% to 30%. Salicylic acid has strong comedolytic effects because of its lipophilic nature. OBJECTIVE: To compare the therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of salicylic acid peels with those of Jessner's solution peels in patients with acne vulgaris. METHODS: Thirteen patients (13 men; mean age 22.6, range 20-28) with facial acne were enrolled. Jessner's solution was applied to one side of each patient's face and 30% salicylic acid to the other in three sessions at 2-week intervals. A blinded investigator counted noninflammatory and inflammatory lesions before treatment and 2 weeks after each treatment. RESULTS: Inflammatory and noninflammatory acne lesion counts decreased in proportion to the duration of treatment. Inflammatory acne lesion counts did not differ significantly between salicylic acid and Jessner's solution peels, although in terms of noninflammatory acne lesion counts, sites treated with salicylic acid showed significant improvement (p = .04), whereas those treated with Jessner's solution did not. CONCLUSION: We found that 30% salicylic acid peels were effective for inflammatory acne and more effective than Jessner's solution peels for treating noninflammatory acne. "
"Abstract: In order to apply curcumin as a photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy (PDT) one needs a formulation that can solubilize and stabilize the compound. Pluronics® (Pluronic) are reported to both solubilize and stabilize curcumin against hydrolytic degradation. The aim of the present work was therefore to investigate the influence of Pluronic formulation on the photocytotoxicity of curcumin. Interactions between curcumin and Pluronics were investigated by fluorescence emission and absorption spectroscopy. Cell survival was measured with the MTT assay. The location of curcumin in the cells was investigated with fluorescence microscopy, and the cellular uptake was measured with fluorescence emission spectroscopy. Pluronics P123 and F127 in contrast to Pluronic P85 and PEG 400 may solubilize curcumin under non-cytotoxic conditions. An inverse relationship between the concentration of Pluronic and the photocytotoxicity of curcumin was observed. Curcumin could rapidly translocate across the cell membrane by passive diffusion. The fluorescence from curcumin in the cells (in the cytoplasm) after 1 hour of incubation was lowered by the presence of Pluronics in the formulation. However, the absolute amount of cell-bound curcumin after 1 hour of incubation was independent of the presence of Pluronics. Curcumin was bound more strongly to cells when incubated with formulations without Pluronics compared to cells incubated with curcumin formulations with Pluronics. Incubation of WiDr cells with curcumin for 6 hours resulted in lysosomal accumulation of curcumin independent of the presence of Pluronics. Lysosomally located curcumin could not be observed in HT1080 cells after 6 hours of incubation. The Pluronics P123 and F127 were found to be suitable for solubilizing and stabilizing curcumin, but inhibited photocytotoxic effects of curcumin unless the Pluronic concentration during treatment of the cells was less than 5-10× above the critical micellar concentration.

"Abstract: Propylene glycol is an aliphatic alcohol that functions as a skin conditioning agent, viscosity decreasing agent, solvent, and fragrance ingredient in cosmetics. Tripropylene glycol functions as a humectant, antioxidant, and emulsion stabilizer. Polypropylene glycols (PPGs), including PPG-3, PPG-7, PPG-9, PPG-12, PPG-13, PPG-15, PPG-16, PPG-17, PPG-20, PPG-26, PPG-30, PPG-33, PPG-34, PPG-51, PPG-52, and PPG-69, function primarily as skin conditioning agents, with some solvent use. The majority of the safety and toxicity information presented is for propylene glycol (PG). Propylene glycol is generally nontoxic and is noncarcinogenic. Clinical studies demonstrated an absence of dermal sensitization at use concentrations, although concerns about irritation remained. The CIR Expert Panel determined that the available information support the safety of tripropylene glycol as well as all the PPGs. The Expert Panel concluded that PG, tripropylene glycol, and PPGs ≥3 are safe as used in cosmetic formulations when formulated to be nonirritating. "
"Abstract: The CIR Expert Panel assessed the safety of Alkyl PEG Ethers as used in cosmetics. These ingredients primarily function in cosmetics as surfactants, and some have additional functions as skin-conditioning agents, fragrance ingredients, and emulsion stabilizers. The Panel reviewed available relevant animal and clinical data, as well as information from previous CIR reports; when data were not available for individual ingredients, the Panel extrapolated from the existing data to support safety. The Panel concluded that the Alkyl PEG ethers are safe as used when formulated to be nonirritating, and the same applies to future alkyl PEG ether cosmetic ingredients that vary from those ingredients recited herein only by the number of ethylene glycol repeat units.

"Abstract: A novel treatment serum formulated to target multiple pathways in the anti-ageing cascade was tested both in vitro and in clinical settings. In vitro testing was performed to assess the ability to stimulate key proteins and genes fundamental to the anti-ageing cascade. The antioxidant potential of the formulation was studied in a UV-irradiation clinical study. A 12-week, open-label, single-centre study was conducted to determine whether this uniquely formulated topical treatment serum could improve visible signs of facial photodamage. Clinical evaluations showed statistically significant reductions in fine wrinkles and coarse wrinkles and improvements in skin texture, tone and radiance starting at week 4 with continued improvements at weeks 8 and 12. Subject self-assessments confirmed that the beneficial effects of the treatment serum were readily observed by the users. The treatment serum was well tolerated with no treatment-related adverse events reported during the 12-week study. Use of this novel treatment serum produced significant improvements in the visible signs of facial photodamage. "
"Abstract: Chronic immunosuppressive treatment was suspected to alter maximal muscle oxidative capacity (Vmax ) of heart transplant recipients, leading to a limitation of their exercise tolerance. It remains undefined whether the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) of right ventricle (RV) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscles were altered by immunosuppressants and/or their vehicles. Vmax was measured polarographically in saponin-skinned fibres of RV and VL biopsies of patients and compared with Vmax of healthy VL and myocardium. Effects of increasing concentrations (1-10-100 μM) of Sandimmune(®) , its vehicle, Cyclosporine (CsA) in ethanol (EtOH), or EtOH alone were tested. The vehicle's effects on MRC complexes were investigated using specific substrates and inhibitors. Ten months after grafting, Vmax of RV and VL of immunosuppressed patients were similar to their Vmax at time of transplantation and to that of control tissues. In Vitro, Sandimmune(®) significantly decreased Vmax while CsA in EtOH or EtOH exerted small and similar effects. Effects of the vehicle were higher than (RV) or identical to (VL) those of Sandimmune(®) . The sites of action of the vehicle on MRC were located on complexes I and IV. While unchanged under chronic immunosuppressive therapy, Vmax of RV and VL muscles was depressed by acute exposure to intravenous Sandimmune(®) in vitro, an effect attributed to its vehicle by inhibition of complexes I and IV of the MRC. This work provides an in vitro proof of a toxic effect on the mitochondria respiratory chain of the vehicle used in the intravenous formulation of Sandimmune(®) but with no clinical consequences in chronically immunosuppressed patients.

"Abstract: Current vitiligo treatments are not always satisfactory for both patients and dermatologists. Recently, combination therapies have been introduced in order to obtain better results and reduce risks in the management of the disease. Novel efficacious products are needed to improve the therapeutic possibilities of dermatologists in the respect of safety for the patients. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of a novel topical in a gel formulation containing phenylalanine, cucumis melo extract, and acetyl cysteine in vitiligo. The present study used an open observational study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the investigated product, given alone or in combination with 311-nm narrow band microphototherapy. Results were compared with those obtained treating a matched patient population with microphototherapy alone and with clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment alone. One hundred forty-nine patients suffering from symmetrical vitiligo affecting less than 10% of the skin surface were evaluated. Patients affected by acral vitiligo only were excluded from the analysis. Treatment duration was scheduled for 12 weeks. Excellent repigmentation (>75%) was achieved by 38-73% of patients, depending on the treatment regimen. Mild to moderate side effects were observed only in patients treated with clobetasol 0.05% ointment. The tested gel formulation showed a good efficacy in improving vitiligo repigmentation. No side effects were observed. "
"BACKGROUND: Important characteristics for ideal skin preparations include long-lasting antimicrobial efficacy and low potential for skin irritation. METHODS: A total of 55 healthy adult subjects were enrolled to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of 3 test formulations applied to inguinal, abdominal, and antecubital sites at post-treatment time points of 30 seconds, 72 hours, and 7 days. To investigate skin irritation potential, the 3 formulations were tested in a 21-day repeat-insult patch test conducted on the skin of the backs of 23 healthy subjects. RESULTS: The mean log(10) reduction (MLR) at 7 days post-treatment produced by a 79% vol/vol ethanol containing 1% wt/vol chlorhexidine gluconate (1% CHG-EtOH) applied to abdominal sites was significantly superior to that produced by a 10% povidone-iodine solution (2.45 MLR vs 0.90 MLR; P < .05). The 1% CHG-EtOH and a 70% vol/vol isopropanol containing 2% wt/vol CHG (2% CHG-IPA) provided statistically equivalent persistence at 72 hours and 7 days post-treatment. The 1% CHG-EtOH had less skin irritation potential than the 2% CHG-IPA and the 10% povidone-iodine solution, although the differences were not statistically significant (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Considering its persistent effect and low skin irritation potential, the 1% CHG-EtOH preparation is expected to perform well in surgical site preparation to reduce the risk of surgery- and catheter-related bloodstream infection.

"Abstract: The moisture content present in human skin makes it look young and the use of moisturizer results in fastening the moisture with a surface film of oil. Acne vulgaris is one of the most commonly seen diseases among the youth. The present study is focused on the use of herbs as moisturizer for acne treatment. The anti-acne moisturizer was formulated from herbal crude extracts and investigated the physico-chemical parameters as well as antibacterial activity of the formulation. The study revealed that ethanol extract of Andrographis paniculata, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Ocimum sanctum, Azadiracta indica and Green tea possessed the potential for inhibiting acne. It was observed that the optimal formula of anti-acne moisturizer was satisfactorily effective to control acne inducing bacteria i.e., Staphylococcus epidermis and Propionibacterium. The physico-chemical parameters of the formulation were also optimal with no signs of irritation. "
"Abstract: In the present study, we prepared an inclusion complex of methotrexate (MTX) with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) in order to decrease its photosensitivity and enhance its aqueous solubility. Then we incorporated this inclusion complex in a self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) overall to increase its oral bioavailability. The inclusion complex has been prepared by freeze drying method and characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), ultraviolet (UV), and infrared (IR) spectroscopy assays. The proper molecular ratio of MTX/β-CD was found to be of 1:7, and the water-solubility of MTX was increased in an average of 10-fold. The photostability studies showed that the MTX became stable on exposure to light. Construction of pseudoternary diagrams were investigated to prepare a MTX/β-CD inclusion complex loaded SMEDDS which was characterized by measuring the particle size and the zeta-potential. The optimum formulation of SMEDDS was a system consisting of ethyl oleate, tween 80, and propylene glycol with a mean droplet size of 39.42 nm. In vitro drug release in different pH media showed that the release profile of MTX from the MTX/β-CD loaded SMEDDS was influenced by the pH of the release medium and presented the characteristics of a sustained release profile. Finally, in-vivo studies showed an enhancement of the bioavailability of MTX from the MTX/β-CD loaded SMEDDS form of 1.57-fold. We concluded that the β-CD inclusion complex loaded SMEDDS improved the chemical and physiological properties of MTX and could be a promising means for the delivery of MTX and other unstable and lipophilic drugs by oral route.

"Abstract: This study focused on fabrication and characterization of porous core/sheath structured composite nanofibers with a core of blended salicylic acid (SA) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and a sheath of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) using a dual-capillary electrospinning system. Results of water contact angle measurements, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy indicated that feed rates of the core and sheath strongly affect the stability of the core/sheath structure and porous density of the composite nanofibers obtained, significantly influencing their SA release characteristics. At a lower ratio of feed rates of the core and the sheath, better stable core/sheath structures of nanofibers with higher porous density on the surface were formed resulting in a sustained release of SA over 5 days. Non-porous fibers showed a lower amount of drug release because the drug was embedded inside the core layer of the non-porous sheath layer. SA release from porous core/sheath nanofibers was described based on a one-dimensional Fickian diffusion mechanism, indicating that drug diffusion is a predominant factor in drug release. A cytotoxicity test suggested that the porous core/sheath nanofibers are non-toxic and support cell attachment. Therefore, this fiber mat may find application in the design of wound-healing patches with long-term activity. "
"Abstract: This randomized, observer-blind, split-face study assessed the irritation potential and likelihood of continued use of clindamycin phosphate 1.2%--benzoyl peroxide (BPO) 2.5% gel or adapalene 0.1%--BPO 2.5% gel once daily over a 14-day treatment period in 21 participants (11 males; 10 females) with acne who were 18 years or older. Investigator clinical assessment (erythema and dryness) and self-assessment (dryness and burning/stinging) were performed at baseline and each study visit (days 1-14) using a 4-point scale (O = none; 3 = severe). Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and corneometry measurements were performed at baseline and days 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 14. Lesions were counted at baseline and on day 14. Participant satisfaction questionnaires were completed on days 7 and 14. At the end of the study, investigators reported none or only mild erythema in 86% (18/21) of participants treated with clindamycin phosphate 1.2%--BPO 2.5% gel compared with 62% (13/21) of participants treated with adapalene 0.1%--BPO 2.5% gel. No severe erythema was reported with clindamycin phosphate 1.2%--BPO 2.5% gel. Adapalene 0.1%--BPO 2.5% gel was prematurely discontinued due to severe erythema in 1 participant on day 5 and a second participant on day 9. Additionally, 2 more participants reported severe erythema on day 14. Mean erythema scores were 0.9 (mean change from baseline, 0.7) with clindamycin phosphate 1.2%--BPO 2.5% gel and 1.4 (mean change from baseline, 1.3) with adapalene 0. 1%--BPO 2.5% gel on day 14 (P < .05 for days 6-14). Similar results were seen with dryness. Mean scores were 0.5 (mean change from baseline, 0.4) and 1.0 (mean change from baseline, 1.0), respectively (P < .05 for days 6-14). Self-assessment, TEWL, and corneometry results underscored the investigator clinical assessment. Participant preference and likelihood of continued usage was greater with clindamycin phosphate 1.2%--BPO 2.5% gel. Continued use and efficacy results for the treatment of acne were influenced by the potential of the product to cause irritation and the participant preferences. Irritation potential was more pronounced and severe with adapalene 0.1%--BPO 2.5% gel. Undoubtedly, as a result more participants preferred treatment with clindamycin phosphate 1.2%--BPO 2.5% gel and were more likely to continue to use the product. "
"BACKGROUND: Topical creams with capsaicin are used to treat pain from a wide range of chronic conditions including neuropathic pain. Following application to the skin capsaicin causes enhanced sensitivity to noxious stimuli, followed by a period with reduced sensitivity and, after repeated applications, persistent desensitisation. There is uncertainty about the efficacy and tolerability of capsaicin for treating painful chronic neuropathies. This is an update of an earlier review of topical capsaicin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults that looked at all doses and formulations of capsaicin. The original review has now been split: here we consider only formulations using a low concentration of capsaicin (< 1%) applied several times daily over several weeks, while another review will consider a single application of capsaicin at a high concentration. OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of topically applied low-concentration (< 1%) capsaicin in chronic neuropathic pain in adults. SEARCH METHODS: Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Oxford Pain Relief Database, searched to July 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of at least six weeks' duration, using low-concentration (< 1%) topical capsaicin to treat neuropathic pain. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed study quality and validity, and extracted data. Information was extracted on numbers of participants with pain relief (clinical improvement) after at least six weeks, and with local skin reactions, and used to calculate relative risk (or risk ratio, RR) and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) and harm (NNH). Details of definition of pain relief and specific adverse events were sought. MAIN RESULTS: No additional studies were identified for this update of low concentration capsaicin. Included studies were published before 1996. Six studies (389 participants in total) compared regular application of low dose (0.075%) capsaicin cream with placebo cream. There was substantial heterogeneity in results, probably as a result of the small number of studies each with small numbers of participants, as well as the different pain conditions studied and different definitions of ""clinical success"" reported. Only two studies reported data for the preferred primary outcome of at least 50% pain relief, and there were too few data for pooled analysis. Local skin reactions were more common with capsaicin, usually tolerable, and attenuated with time; the NNH for repeated low-dose application was 2.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1 to 3.1). All studies satisfied minimum criteria for quality and validity, but maintenance of blinding remains a potential problem. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There were insufficient data to draw any conclusions about the efficacy of low-concentration capsaicin cream in the treatment of neuropathic pain. The information we have suggests that low-concentration topical capsaicin is without meaningful effect beyond that found in placebo creams; given the potential for bias from small study size, this makes it unlikely that low-concentration topical capsaicin has any meaningful use in clinical practice. Local skin irritation, which was often mild and transient but may lead to withdrawal, was common. Systemic adverse effects were rare. "
"CONTEXT: Psoriasis vulgaris is a hyper proliferative, autoimmune skin disorder affecting 1-3% of the world's population. The prescribed synthetic drugs for the treatment of psoriasis are associated with severe side effects, thus, researchers around the globe are searching for new, effective, and safer drugs from natural resources. OBJECTIVE: The present review has been prepared with an objective to compile exhaustive literature on pharmacological reports on antipsoriatic plants, plant products, and formulations. An attempt has been made to incorporate chemical constituents (with structures) isolated from different plants responsible for antipsoriatic activity and their possible mechanism of actions in this review. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The review has been compiled using references from major databases like Chemical Abstracts, Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Abstracts, PubMed, Scirus, Google scholar, Open J Gate, Scopus, Science Direct and Online Journals, and includes 127 references. RESULTS: A survey of literature revealed that extracts/fractions/isolates from 18 plants, 23 chemical constituents of plant origin and 40 plant-based formulations from various systems of medicine have been reported to possess antipsoriatic activity, and 37 antipsoriatic formulations containing plants have been patented. CONCLUSION: Preliminary antipsoriatic activity studies have been carried out on crude extracts of traditionally used and medicinally promising plants. Such plants need to be explored properly with a view to isolate antipsoriatic constituents, and to evaluate their possible mode of actions so that these plant drugs could be exploited properly as potential antipsoriatic drugs.

"Abstract: The use of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) is integral to the field of diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Pharmacokinetic evaluation of the plasma clearance of GBCA is required for all new agents or improved formulations, to address concerns over toxicity or unforeseen side effects. Current methods to measure GBCA in plasma lack either a rapid readout or the sensitivity to measure small samples or require extensive processing of plasma, all obstacles in the development and characterization of new GBCA. Here, we quantify the plasma concentration of a labeled analogue of a common clinical GBCA by ligand triplet harvesting and energy transfer. The nonemittive GBCA becomes a ""dark donor"" to a fluorescent detector molecule, with a lower limit of detection of 10(-7) M in unprocessed plasma. On a time scale of minutes, we determine the plasma clearance rate in the wild-type mouse, using time-resolved fluorescence on a standard laboratory plate reader. "
"Abstract: A novel drug-in-adhesive matrix was designed and prepared. A thermoplastic elastomer, styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS) block copolymer, in combination with tackifying resin and plasticizer, was employed to compose the matrix. Capsaicin was selected as the model drug. The drug percutaneous absorption, adhesion properties, and skin irritation were investigated. The results suggested that the diffusion through SIS matrix was the rate-limiting step of capsaicin percutaneous absorption. [SI] content in SIS and SIS proportions put important effects on drug penetration and adhesion properties. The chemical enhancers had strong interactions with the matrix and gave small effect on enhancement of drug skin permeation. The in vivo absorption of samples showed low drug plasma peaks and a steady and constant plasma level for a long period. These results suggested that the possible side effects of drug were attenuated, and the pharmacological effects were enhanced with an extended therapeutic period after application of SIS matrix. The significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters produced by different formulations demonstrated the influences of SIS copolymer on drug penetrability. Furthermore, the result of skin toxicity test showed that no skin irritation occurred in guinea pig skin after transdermal administration of formulations. "
"Abstract: Topical corticosteroids and sunscreens are extensively used formulations, both as over-the-counter products and as prescription medicines. Topical corticosteroids are increasingly being recognized as causes of allergic contact dermatitis. Because of their anti-inflammatory property, contact allergy to these agents may be difficult to suspect and prove. With corticosteroid allergy, there are special issues in patch testing that need to be considered: Screening tests need to be done with budesonide and tixocortol pivalate, and delayed readings are essential to pick up all positive cases. Preventive advice needs to be tailored according to the structural and chemical peculiarities of a particular molecule. Sunscreen allergy is a significant part of cosmetic allergy; especially in cases of photoallergic reactions. Each passing decade is bringing forth new allergens in this class. In many countries, benzophenones have recently been replaced by octocrylene as the leading causes of contact dermatitis to sunscreens. This article provides a broad overview of corticosteroid and sunscreen allergy so that the readers are aware of these important emerging classes of allergens. "
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: GLPG0259 is a small-molecule inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 5 (MAPKAPK5), a kinase enzyme that plays a role in important inflammatory pathways. The main objectives of the phase I clinical studies in early development were to characterize the pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety of GLPG0259 in healthy subjects, including the development of a solid dosage form (free-base pellets and fumarate salt capsules) and the potential for interaction of GLPG0259 with methotrexate. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Four phase I studies were initiated. Study 1 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single ascending doses (1.5-150 mg) and multiple oral doses (20 and 50 mg once daily) of GLPG0259 in healthy male subjects (n = 34). Study 2 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of oral multiple ascending doses of GLPG0259 (25-75 mg once daily) given for 14 days to healthy male subjects, and to get preliminary information on the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between GLPG0259 and methotrexate (n = 24). Studies 3 and 4 were open-label, randomized, crossover studies to compare the oral bioavailability of two solid dosage forms of GLPG0259 (a capsule) relative to an oral solution after a 100 mg or 50 mg single dose and to evaluate the effect of food on these formulations (n = 12 for each study). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The non-compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters for plasma concentrations of GLPG0259 were determined, and a population pharmacokinetic model of GLPG0259 was developed to support the planning of the number and timing of the sparse samples to be taken per patient in the phase II study. Safety and tolerability data are also summarized. RESULTS: The absorption of GLPG0259 was slow, with a decrease in the absorption rate with increasing dose, and there was decreased elimination, with an apparent terminal elimination half-life of 26.0 hours. On the basis of statistical analysis of variance, the exposure to GLPG0259 increased in proportion to the dose over a 30-150 mg single-dose range and a 25-75 mg repeated-dose range. Between- and within-subject variability in GLPG0259 pharmacokinetics was low/moderate (coefficient of variation [CV] 16-30%). After once-daily repeated dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations were reached at between 5 and 8 dosing days, which is consistent with the long apparent elimination half-life of GLPG0259. Food increased the bioavailability of GLPG0259 given in a solid dosage form. Co-administration of GLPG0259 with a single dose of methotrexate 7.5 mg did not result in any change in the pharmacokinetic profiles of either GLPG0259 or methotrexate. CONCLUSION: In summary, the investigation of safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetics in the early development phase showed that single and repeated doses of GLPG0259 were safe and well tolerated. The most common adverse event reported was mild gastrointestinal discomfort. The pharmacokinetics characterized in healthy male subjects showed no major obstacles and supports a once-daily oral regimen in patients. "
"Abstract: Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure from the sun and artificial UV sources has been widely acknowledged as the major culprit for skin cancer and premature skin ageing. Skin cancers are among the most dangerous (cutaneous malignant melanoma) and the most numerous (basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis and invasive squamous cell carcinoma) of all neoplasms in the caucasian population worldwide. Skin cancers therefore have a significant impact on public health and healthcare costs, and will continue to do so. It is obvious that adequate photoprotection - seeking shade, wearing protective clothing and using sunscreens - is the key to reducing the harmful effects of UVR in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised people. This article provides background information on UVR, photoprotection (including the concept of topical sunscreen formulations), associated concerns regarding efficacy and safety, and behavioural and educational aspects of photoprotection and skin cancer prevention in immunocompetent and immunocompromised people. Certain persistent misconceptions and mistakes regarding photoprotection are also addressed. "
"PURPOSE: Topical preparations of cyclosporine (CsA) are common therapeutics for the treatment of dry eye. However, they are not devoid of side effects, such as allergy and irritation. The present study aimed at evaluating the safety profile of a new CsA formulation in cationic emulsion (CEm) in vitro with a dynamic corneal wound healing assay using human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells, and in vivo in a rabbit acute toxicity model. METHODS: Three different csa formulations were tested: 1) 0.05%CsA-CEm, 2) commercial 0.05%CsA-Anionic emulsion (CsA-AEm, Restasis®), and 3) 0.05%CsA-Oil solution. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used as negative control and 0.02% benzalkonium chloride (BAK) as the toxic control. In vitro, a wound was created by scratching through a confluent HCE cell layer and exposed 30 min to 1/10 dilutions of the different formulations. Cytotoxicity, cell migration, and proliferation were performed to analyze the recovery at days 1, 2, and 3. In vivo, the eye drops were applied to rabbit eyes 15 times at 5-min intervals. The ocular surface structures were examined with a slit-lamp and by corneal in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) for detailed examination of corneal epithelium, stroma, limbus, and conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissue (CALT) structures. RESULTS: The in vitro study confirmed that a 0.02% BAK solution delayed the corneal healing process (-57%) by severely damaging the remaining HCE cells. The other formulations maintained a normal healing rate with a similar behavior for CsA-CEm, CsA-AEm, and PBS with no significant differences (at D3, 66%-74% closure). In the rabbit, 0.02%BAK showed the highest toxicity, inducing redness, chemosis with damaged corneal epithelium, and inflammatory cell infiltrations. CsA-AEm and CsA-Oil induced moderate infiltrations of inflammatory cells around the CALT. CsA-CEm presented the lowest toxicity with patterns similar to PBS. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of these in vitro and in vivo models evaluated the tolerance/cytotoxicity and the dynamic wound healing potential of CsA in different formulations. While CsA-AEm, CsA-CEm, and CsA-Oil are generally well tolerated, only CsA-CEm appeared to maintain the HCE cells' normal healing rate in vitro and low levels of inflammation in vivo. "
"Abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro skin phototoxicity of cosmetic formulations containing photounstable and photostable UV-filters and vitamin A palmitate, assessed by two in vitro techniques: 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Test and Human 3-D Skin Model In Vitro Phototoxicity Test. For this, four different formulations containing vitamin A palmitate and different UV-filters combinations, two of them considered photostable and two of them considered photounstable, were prepared. Solutions of each UV-filter and vitamin under study and solutions of four different combinations under study were also prepared. The phototoxicity was assessed in vitro by the 3T3 NRU phototoxicity test (3T3-NRU-PT) and subsequently in a phototoxicity test on reconstructed human skin model (H3D-PT). Avobenzone presented a pronounced phototoxicity and vitamin A presented a tendency to a weak phototoxic potential. A synergistic effect of vitamin A palmitate on the phototoxicity of combinations containing avobenzone was observed. H3D-PT results did not confirm the positive 3T3-NRU-PT results. However, despite the four formulations studied did not present any acute phototoxicity potential, the combination 2 containing octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC), avobenzone (AVB) and 4-methylbenzilidene camphor (MBC) presented an indication of phototoxicity that should be better investigated in terms of the frequency of photoallergic or chronic phototoxicity in humans, once these tests are scientifically validated only to detect phototoxic potential with the aim of preventing phototoxic reactions in the general population, and positive results cannot predict the exact incidence of phototoxic reactions in humans. "
"Abstract: Topical application of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in photodynamic therapy is of great interest because of avoiding systemic side effects with such an easy way of application. However, due to ALA's high polarity its dermal bioavailability is rather limited and thus, permeation enhancement of this active is of major interest in research. In a previous study, a semisolid poloxamer 407-based (POX), five-component system (""thermogel"") was developed for permeation enhancement of ALA across isolated human stratum corneum. In the present study, five-component systems of systematically varied compositions were investigated both rheologically and in terms of permeation enhancement. The five-component systems contained water, a fixed combination of 1:1 of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and dimethyl isosorbide (DMIS) and a fixed ratio of 4:1 of POX to propylene glycol dicaprylocaprate (MIG). Rheological characterization showed that complex viscosity depended on IPA/DMIS and POX/MIG content. The gelation temperature (GT) was strongly influenced by interactions between MIG, IPA and DMIS. Regarding permeation behavior, several systems showing better permeation fluxes than the original ""thermogel"" were identified. Surprisingly, permeation flux did not inversely correlate with the complex viscosity, showing that permeation behavior may depend on a variety of further physicochemical characteristics including individual composition and microstructure of the respective formulation.

"Abstract: Skin roughness is a term commonly used in Japan to describe a poor skin condition related to a rough and dry skin surface that develops as a result of various damaging effects from the environment or skin inflammation. Recovery from skin roughness requires skin care for a long period, thus it is important to prevent development of such skin changes. PROTECT X2 contains agents used for a protective covering of the skin from frequent hand washing or use of alcohol-based disinfectants. These unique components are also thought to be effective to treat skin roughness of the dorsa of the hands and heels. In the present study, we evaluated the effectiveness of PROTECT X2 to increase skin surface hydration state, as well as enhance the barrier function of the stratum corneum of the dorsa of the hands and heels in elderly individuals. A total of 8 elderly subjects and their caretakers without any skin diseases participated in the study. They applied PROTECT X2 by themselves to the dorsum area of 1 hand and heel 3 to 5 times daily for 1 month, while the opposite sides were left untreated. We measured stratum corneum (SC) hydration and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) before beginning treatment, then 1 week and 1 month after the start of treatment to compare between the treated and untreated skin. SC hydration state after applications of PROTECT X2 was 1.5- to 3.0-fold higher than that of the untreated skin in the dorsa of both hands and heels, indicating that the moisturizing ingredients accompanied by water were replenished in those areas where the cream was applied. Also, TEWL in the dorsum of the hands was 17.0-27.9% lower on the treated side, indicating improvement in SC barrier function. On the basis of these findings, we concluded that PROTECT X2 enhances water-holding in the SC and aids the barrier function of the skin in the dorsum of the hands. In addition, we consider that this formulation is useful for not only protecting the hands from the effects of such agents as detergents and alcohol-based disinfectants, but also for protecting heel skin covered by a thick SC from dry and cold conditions such as those encountered in winter. However, since the SC in that area is much thicker than that of the hands, the barrier function was not significantly improved within 1 month of daily treatments. "
"BACKGROUND: Novel, blue fluorescent solids referred to as Wild Plum compounds can camouflage skin imperfections when incorporated into cosmetic products. We evaluated the relationship between sun exposure and skin fluorescence and determined if the application of Wild Plum formulations could restore lost fluorescence without harming the skin. METHODS: The forehead skin of two groups of volunteers of mixed gender and age was examined for fluorescence and redness. In addition, subjects answered questions describing any adverse sensations they experienced after their skin was exposed to Wild Plum formulations for extended periods of time. RESULTS: Fluorescence measurements of both solar and non-solar skin indicated that repeated sun exposure causes a loss of skin fluorescence. Application of Wild Plum formulations caused an increase in skin fluorescence at all concentrations, restoring solar skin fluorescence to values well beyond that of non-solar skin. Photo analysis and interview questions indicated that these formulations did not cause any symptoms of irritancy. CONCLUSION: Wild Plum compounds have the ability to restore fluorescence of solar skin to a level significantly higher than that associated with non-solar skin. Skin appears more luminous and therefore more youthful. This fluorescence restoration is achieved at relatively low concentrations, without any harmful side effects. "
"Abstract: Many patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) have uncontrolled symptoms despite available treatment options. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MP29-02 (a novel intranasal formulation of fluticasone propionate [FP] and azelastine [AZ] hydrochloride), compared with monotherapy with FP, AZ, and placebo sprays for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). This 2-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 779 patients with moderate-to-severe SAR. Treatments were administered 1 spray/nostril twice daily in the same vehicle and delivery device. Daily doses of AZ and FP were 548 and 200 micrograms, respectively. The primary efficacy variable was the 12-hour reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS), consisting of nasal congestion, sneezing, itchy nose, and runny nose. Secondary efficacy variables were (1) 12-hour reflective individual nasal symptom scores; (2) onset of action; (3) 12-hour reflective total ocular symptom score (rTOSS), including itchy eyes, watery eyes, and red eyes; and (4) the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) overall score. MP29-02 significantly reduced the mean rTNSS from baseline by -5.54 points compared with FP (-4.55; p = 0.038), AZ (-4.54; p = 0.032), and placebo (-3.03; p < 0.001), improving the rTNSS by 39% beyond the contribution of FP. All individual nasal symptoms contributed to the efficacy of MP29-02. Onset of action was within 30 minutes. MP29-02 significantly improved rTOSS compared with placebo, provided a clinically important improvement in the overall RQLQ score, and was well tolerated. In this study, MP29-02 provided more complete symptom relief than two widely used first-line AR treatments and was well tolerated. "
"BACKGROUND: α-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) is a melanocortin peptide that increases skin pigmentation during ultraviolet light-mediated tanning. As α-MSH has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory effects, we assessed the clinical potential of a superpotent α-MSH analogue, afamelanotide (Nle(4)-D-Phe(7)-α-MSH), in patients with acne vulgaris, the most common inflammatory skin disorder. METHODS: Afamelanotide (16 mg) was given in a phase II open-label pilot study subcutaneously as a sustained-release resorbable implant formulation to 3 patients with mild-to-moderate facial acne vulgaris. Evaluation included lesion count, adverse effects and patient-reported outcome. Monitoring of laboratory parameters included differential blood counts, electrolytes, urine analysis, and liver and kidney function tests. Skin melanin density was measured by reflectance spectrophotometry. RESULTS: The total number as well as the number of inflammatory acne lesions declined in all patients 56 days after the first injection of afamelanotide. Life quality as measured by Dermatology Life Quality Index likewise improved in all 3 patients 56 days after the first injection of afamelanotide. There were no adverse effects except mild and short-term fatigue in one patient. All patients experienced increased pigmentation especially on the face. Clinically relevant changes in laboratory parameters were not detected. CONCLUSIONS: Afamelanotide appears to have anti-inflammatory effects in patients with mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris. Future trials are needed to confirm the anti-inflammatory action of this melanocortin analogue in patients with acne vulgaris. "
Abstract: Acne treatment regimens have changed due to the recent over-the-counter (OTC) switch of all prescription benzoyl peroxide (BPO) topical preparations. The elimination of prescription single-agent BPO products means that dermatologists must select from a variety of OTC formulations to utilize the time-tested efficacy of BPO in the treatment of mild to moderate acne. Our research compared the efficacy and safety of an OTC BPO 5.5% formulation with lipohydroxy acid and tretinoin cream 0.025% with prescription clindamycin 1%-BPO 5% gel and tretinoin cream 0.025%. Parity was demonstrated between the 2 treatment regimens at 12 weeks. 
"Abstract: The treatment of dermatitis with conventional dosage forms (ointment, cream, lotion etc.) has many concerns due to side effects especially in long-term therapy. Recent studies focused on strategies to optimize the potency of formulation while minimizing side effects. Several attempts have been made to increase the safety of treatment, including special vehicles (nanoparticle, liposome, patch etc.), combined therapy and new synthesized agents. This review provides major innovations and advances of new approaches for dermatitis treatment based on the published articles and patent applications. "
"Abstract: This review summarizes and discusses the role and efficacy of moisturizers, particularly the more recently introduced ceramide-based formulations, in the skin care regimen of patients with both active and quiescent atopic dermatitis (AD). It is now well established that a complex interplay of environmental and genetic factors are responsible for disease onset and chronicity. Indeed, several novel genetic mechanisms have been recently discovered to be associated with AD pathogenesis. Moreover, it is increasingly recognized that the epidermal barrier plays a critical role in the initiation, perpetuation, and exacerbation of AD. The skin of patients with AD harbors several defects in epidermal barrier function, including filaggrin and ceramides. An improved understanding of these etiopathogenic factors has led to the development of topical ceramide-dominant moisturizers to replace the deficient molecules and re-establish the integrity of barrier defenses. Some of these products have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of adult and childhood AD that are similar to mid-potency topical steroids. More importantly, they have been shown to be safe with very few associated side-effects. We recommend the addition of such new agents as both the first step of treatment and in the maintenance of clinically quiescent skin of patients with AD. "
"Abstract: Skin inflammatory diseases are most commonly treated with corticosteroids, especially topical preparations, benefitting from high potency and unparalleled formulation flexibility. However, these benefits are limited due to side effects, especially under long-term use. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which block the COX pathways have been used as safer alternatives to corticosteroids, and much effort and resources have been invested in developing COX inhibitors. However, synthetic NSAIDs are less potent than steroids, have limited formulation flexibility and have their own safety issues, thereby yielding unsatisfactory results, with some high-profile drugs (e.g., the COX-2 inhibitors Vioxx, Celebrex) being withdrawn from the market due to safety concerns. The potency and safety challenges of NSAIDs are related to inter-eicosanoid dynamics, pertaining to their pro-versus anti-inflammatory action, homeostatic functions and tissue-specific activities. Instead, the upstream control of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymatic activity, which hydrolyzes cell membrane phospholipids to initiate the eicosanoid production, has been considered for inhibiting eicosanoid activation while maintaining the intricate balance needed for their homeostatic functions. Yet, PLA(2) inhibitors have hardly been tested for treating skin inflammatory/allergic conditions. In this article we review the involvement of PLA(2)s in skin physiology and pathology, and discuss the prospect of PLA(2) inhibition for the treatment of dermatological diseases. "
"Abstract: Clocortolone pivalate is a mid-potency topical corticosteroid available as a 0.1% emollient cream approved by the United States Food and Drug Aministration for use in the treatment of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. The vehicle is formulated for application to a variety of corticosteroid-responsive skin disorders, including those with inflamed and fissured skin, such as eczematous dermatoses. Hence, the potency of the formulation and its vehicle characteristics are important when treating disorders, such as atopic dermatitis and other eczematous dermatoses, which are prone to cutaneous irritation and skin sensitivity to exogenously applied agents. As both localized and diffuse eczematous dermatoses and seborrheic dermatitis are common in pediatric patients (including infants) as well as in adults, the fact that clocortolone pivalate 0.1% cream has no age restriction related to its use according to United States Food and Drug Aministration-approved product labeling is important to recognize. The chemical structure of clocortolone pivalate is a unique design that provides high lipid solubility. Highly lipophilic topical corticosteroids exhibit augmented penetration through the stratum corneum, which provides higher epidermal concentrations. It has been reported that the structural characteristics of this molecule enhance its potency without increasing the potential for topical corticosteroid-related adverse effects. Clocortolone pivalate 0.1% cream has been studied in randomized, controlled trials of patients with atopic dermatitis and other eczematous dermatoses, psoriasis vulgaris, contact dermatitis, and seborrheic dermatitis. It has been shown to be more effective as monotherapy in the treatment of these corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses than the vehicle. Its efficacy and safety in pediatric patients and patients with facial dermatoses have also been demonstrated. Patients using clocortolone pivalate 0.1% topical cream in clinical trials had a low rate of adverse events, which were primarily minor application-site reactions. Systemic reactions related to the drug were not observed in these trials. Clinical studies of patients with corticosteroid-responsive dermatological conditions have found that clocortolone pivalate 0.1% cream is an effective class 4 topical corticosteroid with a favorable safety profile.

"Abstract: Two separate single-center, randomized, evaluator-blinded, bilateral (split-face) comparison studies compared the tolerability of adapalene 0.1% cream with adapalene 0.1% lotion in individuals with healthy skin treated once per day for 3 weeks. At each visit, the participants were graded on erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning (scale: 0 = none to 3 = severe). On the final study visit, the participants completed a Cosmetic Acceptability Questionnaire. Adverse events were recorded at each study visit. A total of 144 participants were enrolled and 130 completed the studies (study 1, n = 66; study 2, n = 64). The lotion formulation was non-inferior to the cream for the success rates and tolerability assessments in both studies. The frequency distributions of worst scores of either 0 (none) or 1 (mild) (study 1; study 2) for adapalene lotion were erythema (98.5%; 40.7%), scaling (100%; 73.5%), dryness (100%; 68.8%), and stinging/burning (98.5%; 100%). The most common treatment-related adverse event was dryness (study 1, cream 2.7% [2 of 75] and lotion 4.0% [3/75]); study 2, cream 2.9% [2 of 69] and lotion 4.3% [3 of 69]. Both the adapalene 0.1% cream and 0.1% lotion formulations were well tolerated and acceptable to the study participants. The adapalene 0.1% lotion provides clinicians with a retinoid for the treatment of acne in a lotion formulation. "
"Abstract: Colloidal oatmeal has been used for decades to soothe and ameliorate atopic dermatitis and other pruritic and/or xerotic dermatoses. In-vitro and/or in-vivo studies have confirmed the anti-inflammatory, barrier repair, and moisturizing properties of this compound. A broad set of studies has been conducted in recent years to assess the effects of colloidal oatmeal as adjunct treatment in the management of atopic dermatitis (AD). This paper will review these studies. In these investigations, patients in all age groups (3 months to 60 years) with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis were included and allowed to continue their prescribed topical medications. These studies found that the daily use of moisturizers and/or cleansers containing colloidal oatmeal significantly improved many clinical outcomes of atopic dermatitis from baseline: investigator's assessment (IGA), eczema area and severity index (EASI), itch, dryness, and quality of life indices. Safety results showed that the formulations were well tolerated in babies, children, and adults with AD. "
"BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris is a very common skin disease with a significant detrimental effect on the quality of life of the patients. AIMS: To assess the comparative efficacy and safety of a nano-emulsion gel formulation of adapalene and clindamycin combination with its conventional formulation in the treatment of acne vulgaris of the face. It was a prospective, randomized, open label, active-controlled, multicentric, clinical trial. METHODS: Eligible patients suffering from acne vulgaris of the face were randomized to receive once-daily treatment with a nano-emulsion gel or conventional gel formulation of adapalene 0.1% and clindamycin (as phosphate) 1% combination for 12 weeks. Total, inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts, with grading of acne severity were carried out on a monthly basis. Safety assessments were done to determine the comparative local and systemic tolerability. Two-tailed significance testing was carried out with appropriate statistical tests, and P-values < 0.05 were considered as significant. RESULTS: 209/212 patients enrolled in the study were eligible for efficacy and safety assessments in both nano-emulsion gel (118/119 patients) and conventional gel (91/93 patients) groups. Significantly better reductions in total (79.7% vs. 62.7%), inflammatory (88.7% vs. 71.4%) and noninflammatory (74.9% vs. 58.4%) lesions were reported with the nano-emulsion gel as compared to the conventional gel (P < 0.001 for all). Mean acne severity score also reduced significantly more with the nano-emulsion formulation (1.9 ± 0.9 vs. 1.4 ± 1.0; P < 0.001) than the comparator. Significantly lower incidence and lesser intensity of adverse events like local irritation (4.2% vs. 19.8%; P < 0.05) and erythema (0.8% vs. 9.9%; P < 0.05) were recorded with the nano-emulsion gel. CONCLUSIONS: The nano-emulsion gel formulation of adapalene and clindamycin combination appears to be more efficacious and better tolerated than the conventional formulation for the treatment of acne vulgaris in Indian patients. Further studies can elucidate the comparative treatment benefits of this nano-emulsion gel formulation. "
"BACKGROUND: Due to the increase of solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) incidence over the last few decades, the use of sunscreen has been widely adopted for skin protection. However, considering the high efficiency of sunlight-induced DNA lesions, it is critical to improve upon the current approaches that are used to evaluate protection factors. An alternative approach to evaluate the photoprotection provided by sunscreens against daily UV radiation-induced DNA damage is provided by the systematic use of a DNA dosimeter. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The Sun Protection Factor for DNA (DNA-SPF) is calculated by using specific DNA repair enzymes, and it is defined as the capacity for inhibiting the generation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) and oxidised DNA bases compared with unprotected control samples. Five different commercial brands of sunscreen were initially evaluated, and further studies extended the analysis to include 17 other products representing various formulations and Sun Protection Factors (SPF). Overall, all of the commercial brands of SPF 30 sunscreens provided sufficient protection against simulated sunlight genotoxicity. In addition, this DNA biosensor was useful for rapidly screening the biological protection properties of the various sunscreen formulations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The application of the DNA dosimeter is demonstrated as an alternative, complementary, and reliable method for the quantification of sunscreen photoprotection at the level of DNA damage.

"Abstract: The cofortification of milk with iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) is a strategy used to prevent these deficiencies during childhood. Given that Zn can negatively interact with iron in aqueous solutions, the objective of the present study was to determine the effect of Zn on Fe absorption of milk fortified with Fe and Zn. Twenty-eight women between 33 and 47 years of age, with contraception and a negative pregnancy test, participated in one of two absorption studies. They received on four different days, after an overnight fast, 200 mL of milk (26 % fat) fortified with 10 mg Fe/L, as (A) ferrous sulfate, or the same milk but with graded doses of added Zn, as Zn sulfate of (B) 5, (C) 10, and (D) 20 mg/L (study 1, n = 15). In study 2 (n = 13), subjects received the same milk formulations, but these were also fortified with ascorbic acid (70 mg/L). Milk was labeled with radioisotopes ⁵⁹Fe or ⁵⁵Fe, and the absorption of iron was measured by erythrocyte incorporation of radioactive Fe. The geometric mean and range of ±1 SD of Fe absorption in study 1 were as follows: formula A = 6.0 % (2.8-13.0 %); B = 6.7 % (3.3-13.6 %); C = 5.4 % (2.2-13.2 %); and D = 5.2 % (2.8-10.0 %) (ANOVA for repeated measures, not significant). For study 2, data are as follows: 8.2 % (3.6-18.7 %); B = 6.4 % (2.5-16.4 %); C = 7.7 % (3.2-18.9 %); and D = 5.2 (1.8-14.8 %) (ANOVA for repeated measures, not significant). In conclusion, according to the results from this study, it appears that the addition of zinc up to 20 mg/L does not significantly inhibit iron absorption from milk fortified with 10 mg/L of iron. "
"BACKGROUND: Skin-lightening preparations are used by people all over the world for a diverse range of dermatologic indications. The gold standard treatment for skin lightening is with hydroquinone but has been controversial because of the presence of several side effects. Therefore, there has been a constant search for developing new treatment alternatives. Furthermore, the new amendments and bans on animal testing by ECVAM have made the three-dimensional models like EpiDerm(™) and MelanoDerm(™) increasingly popular. OBJECTIVE: This work aims at the formulation development for a new skin-lightening agent, SMA-012, followed by testing for skin irritation and efficacy. METHODS: Formulation parameters such as concentration of SMA-012, amount of ethanol, effect of permeation enhancers and pH were first optimized using Franz cell experiments. Tape stripping and underlying skin assays were performed to analyze the amounts of SMA-012 in different layers of skin. The irritation potential and efficacy of the screened formulation were evaluated using Epiderm(™) and Melanoderm(™) models. RESULTS: Skin permeation experiments suggested that concentrations of 0.1% SMA-012, 35% ethanol, and pH of 8.5 to be the best formulation characteristics. This particular formulation was found to be nonirritant for short-term exposure, when tested in Epiderm(™) model and also significantly effective in decreasing the amount of melanin in pigmented skin equivalent models. CONCLUSION: SMA-012 shows a good promise as a skin-lightening agent for cosmetic and therapeutic applications. Additionally, our study demonstrates the application of skin equivalent models as alternatives to animal testing in studying the regulation of skin pigmentation. "
"Abstract: According to survey data, 35-69% of patients with skin disease have used complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in their lifetime. A literature search on this subject reveals a number of studies on the efficacy of CAM treatment for dermatologic conditions, as well as a number of articles showing the growing prevalence of CAM use amongst patients suffering from these conditions. Given the consensus amongst these articles that dermatologists require increased education on CAM, this paper presents an overview of some of the most widely used systems of alternative medicine to serve as a tool for practicing dermatologists. Specifically, the history and theory behind psychocutaneous therapies, traditional Chinese medicine (including acupuncture), homeopathy, and Ayurvedic medicine will be described, along with current evidence for their efficacy and reports of their adverse effects. The authors conclude that more evidence and better studies are needed for each of the major CAM modalities before they may be considered as independent therapeutic options. Moreover, given the shortage of evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of CAM, dermatologists should obtain a thorough history of CAM use from their patients. In general, ingestible substances including most homeopathic, Ayurvedic, and traditional Chinese medicine herbal formulations that are not US FDA regulated should be viewed with caution as they may cause severe adverse effects such as arsenicosis and hepatotoxicity. On the other hand, less invasive techniques such as acupuncture and psychocutaneous therapies may be more acceptable given their low-risk profile. Ultimately, until the availability of more sound data, these treatments should primarily be used in combination with conventional treatment and rarely independently. "
"BACKGROUND: Some national guidelines recommend the use of water alone for napkin cleansing. Yet, there is a readiness, amongst many parents, to use baby wipes. Evidence from randomised controlled trials, of the effect of baby wipes on newborn skin integrity is lacking. We conducted a study to examine the hypothesis that the use of a specifically formulated cleansing wipe on the napkin area of newborn infants (<1 month) has an equivalent effect on skin hydration when compared with using cotton wool and water (usual care). METHODS: A prospective, assessor-blinded, randomised controlled equivalence trial was conducted during 2010. Healthy, term babies (n=280), recruited within 48 hours of birth, were randomly assigned to have their napkin area cleansed with an alcohol-free baby wipe (140 babies) or cotton wool and water (140 babies). Primary outcome was change in hydration from within 48 hours of birth to 4 weeks post-birth. Secondary outcomes comprised changes in trans-epidermal water loss, skin surface pH and erythema, presence of microbial skin contaminants/irritants at 4 weeks and napkin dermatitis reported by midwife at 4 weeks and mother during the 4 weeks. RESULTS: Complete hydration data were obtained for 254 (90.7 %) babies. Wipes were shown to be equivalent to water and cotton wool in terms of skin hydration (intention-to-treat analysis: wipes 65.4 (SD 12.4) vs. water 63.5 (14.2), p=0.47, 95% CI -2.5 to 4.2; per protocol analysis: wipes 64.6 (12.4) vs. water 63.6 (14.3), p=0.53, 95% CI -2.4 to 4.2). No significant differences were found in the secondary outcomes, except for maternal-reported napkin dermatitis, which was higher in the water group (p=0.025 for complete responses). CONCLUSIONS: Baby wipes had an equivalent effect on skin hydration when compared with cotton wool and water. We found no evidence of any adverse effects of using these wipes. These findings offer reassurance to parents who choose to use baby wipes and to health professionals who support their use. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN86207019. "
"Abstract: Topical application of ketoprofen (KP) clinically evokes the allergic type of photocontact dermatitis. To avoid this adverse reaction, we investigated the beneficial effect of each ultraviolet (UV) filter that was included in topical ketoprofen formulation. We first tested the inhibitory effects of four UVA filters by a modified local lymph node assay following KP application on the mouse skin and UVA irradiation on the same site. In this assessment, butyl methoxy dibenzoylmethane (BMDBM), when included in KP application, exerted the most effective inhibitory effect on stimulation with KP and UVA. We manufactured topical patch and gel KP applicants containing BMDBM, which retained KP penetration through the skin and KP stability toward UVA. The ability of BMDBM in these formulations to inhibit KP photosensitivity was evaluated by a modified adjuvant and strip method in guinea pigs, and the photoallergic reactions induced by the BMDBM-containing KP applicants were lower than the non-containing ones. It is known that KP has a cross-reactivity with benzophenone upon UVA exposure, but such a photocross-reactivity of BMDBM with KP was not observed in a mouse ear swelling model. The anti-inflammatory effect of the BMDBM-containing KP patch applicant was comparable to the non-containing one. These results suggest that the addition of BMDBM into KP topical formulations is efficacious for inhibition of KP photocontact dermatitis. "
"BACKGROUND: Although reliable prevalence data are not available, adult acne is thought to be somewhat common, and it is not unusual for patients to have acne as well as early signs of skin aging. A novel anti-acne/anti-aging formulation (Treatment A) has been developed for daily use by patients to address both signs of skin aging and facial acne vulgaris. The novel, non-prescription formulation includes several ingredients shown to target factors underlying the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris while also addressing multiple components in the pathophysiology of skin aging. METHODS: A blinded, randomized, split-face study was conducted to evaluate and compare the tolerability and efficacy of the novel anti-acne/ anti-aging product in subjects with photodamaged skin and acne vulgaris relative to tretinoin cream 0.025% (Treatment B). All subjects also were given supportive skincare, consisting of a cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen. Each treatment was assessed for its effects on subjects' appearance, lesion count reductions, and tolerability. RESULTS: Treatment A produced statistically significantly greater improvements in skin tone evenness, skin tone clarity, and blemishes and blotchiness. There were also statistically greater reductions in total lesion count for acne patients on the side of the face treated with Treatment A compared to Treatment B; Treatment A was also associated with early (day 2) improvement in skin tone evenness and clarity, tactile skin smoothness, and blemishes and blotchiness. Both treatments demonstrated favorable tolerability. CONCLUSION: The novel topical anti-aging/anti-acne therapy (Treatment A) within a comprehensive skin care regimen of cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen may maximize efficacy and tolerability and contribute to our armamentarium for treating both photodamage and acne at the same time.

"Abstract: Inorganic ultraviolet filters such as titanium dioxide (TiO(2)), safe to use on healthy skin, are often applied on compromised and irradiated skin. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the cutaneous penetration of TiO(2) nanoparticles (≥20 nm primary size), included in a sunscreen, in intact, damaged, irradiated, and damaged/irradiated pigskin. Cutaneous penetration and localization of TiO(2) after a 24-h sunscreen application were investigated quantitatively using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, and qualitatively using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Elemental identity of the nanoparticles was evaluated by TEM-coupled Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (TEM-EDX). In intact and damaged/irradiated skins, 102.35±4.20% and 102.84±5.67% of the titanium deposited, respectively, were found at the surface and stratum corneum (SC), whereas only 0.19±0.15% and 0.39±0.39% were found in the viable epidermis and dermis and no titanium was detected in the receptor fluid. TEM-EDX analysis confirmed the presence of titanium in the aggregates formed by TiO(2) at the SC surface, as already characterized in the sunscreen formulation. TiO(2) nanoparticles included in a sunscreen thus remain in the uppermost layers of the SC, whether in intact skin or in compromised and/or skin exposed to simulated solar radiation. "
"BACKGROUND: Topical calcipotriene is frequently prescribed for the treatment of plaque-type psoriasis. Calcipotriene is currently available in the US as an ointment, a solution, a cream, and in a fixed-dose combination ointment with betamethasone dipropionate. Calcipotriene 0.005% has recently been formulated as a foam using a novel aqueous-based formulation to provide a new topical treatment option for patients with psoriasis. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical calcipotriene 0.005% foam for the treatment of mild to moderate plaque-type psoriasis. DESIGN: Two identical, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, 8-week phase III clinical trials. INTERVENTION: Subjects with plaque-type psoriasis affecting 2-20% of the body surface area, with an identifiable target lesion affecting the trunk or extremities, were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to calcipotriene foam (n = 437) or vehicle foam (n = 222). Study medication was applied twice daily for 8 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: Treatment success was defined as a score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear) on the Investigator's Static Global Assessment (ISGA) psoriasis rating scale and a minimum improvement of ISGA score of at least 2 grades from baseline. Predefined target lesions were assessed for erythema, scaling, and plaque thickness. Primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects in each treatment group who achieved treatment success after 8 weeks, analyzed on an intent-to-treat (ITT) basis. In the primary endpoint analysis, subjects missing 8-week outcomes data were classified as treatment failures regardless of their outcomes at earlier evaluations. As part of the sensitivity analysis, a last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) approach to impute missing 8-week efficacy outcomes also examined treatment. Secondary endpoints included treatment success as a function of baseline ISGA score (mild or moderate), ISGA score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear), and effects of treatment on target lesion. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study. RESULTS: In the ITT population of Study 1, treatment success after 8 weeks was achieved by 14% of subjects in the calcipotriene foam group versus 7% of subjects in the vehicle foam group (p = 0.058). In the LOCF analysis, treatment success was achieved by more subjects with calcipotriene foam than with vehicle foam (15% vs 7%; p = 0.034). In Study 2, treatment success was achieved by more subjects in the calcipotriene foam group for the primary endpoint (27% vs 16%; p = 0.016) and the LOCF analysis (28% vs 16%; p = 0.010). Subjects in the calcipotriene foam group exhibited better response rates than did the vehicle foam group for most of the secondary outcomes. Calcipotriene foam was safe with an overall incidence of AEs similar to those experienced in the vehicle foam group. Application-site reactions were noted in approximately 1-2% of subjects in each group. No AE was reported in more than 2% of subjects in the calcipotriene foam group. Treatment was discontinued because of AEs in approximately 2% of subjects in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: In two identically designed, phase III clinical trials, calcipotriene 0.005% foam was safe and effective for the treatment of mild to moderate plaque-type psoriasis for up to 8 weeks. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00688519 and NCT00689481. "
"AIM: Cyclosporine A (CyA) is an anti inflammatory drug which modulates immune system. We prepared two liposomal formulations of CyA for ophthalmic administration. In the present study, the safety of these formulations was tested in rabbits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fusogenic and positively charged liposomes were prepared by solvent evaporation method. CyA concentration in ophthalmic preparations was 0.2% w/v. Twenty New Zealand albino rabbits (40 eyes) were divided into two groups. Right eyes were treated and left eyes served as control. Eyes were examined clinically in 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28th days of the study. Eleven eyes were enucleated for pathological evaluation at the end of the study. RESULTS: Mean size and charge of positively charged and fusogenic liposomes were 110.7 ± 1.5 and 114.9 ± 15.2 nm; 19.0 ± 2.2 and 2.5 ± 0.5 mV, respectively. Clinically, there were transient conjunctival injections and corneal epithelial defects in a few cases which were not limited to the treated eyes. Positively charged liposomes caused conjunctival injection in two cases, while this complication occurred in only one eye after administration of fusogenic liposomes. Histopathological examination revealed the presence of follicular conjunctivitis in two eyes with conjunctival injection. Inflammation in cases received the fusogenic form of the drug was mild and non-specific. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that fusogenic liposomal preparation of CyA is safe and can be useful for future studies. "
"Abstract: The use of targeted drug delivery systems is a growing trend in cancer treatment to decrease the adverse effect of anti-cancer drugs. In this study, we sought to conjugate methotrexate-human serum albumin nanoparticles (MTX-HSA NPs) with luteinizing-hormone releasing hormone (LHRH). The LHRH was intended to target LHRH receptors overexpressed on the several types of tumors. The expression of LHRH receptors on the 4T1 breast cancer cells was confirmed by FITC conjugated LHRH receptor antibody using fluorescence microscopy. Female Balb/c mice bearing 4T1 breast cancer tumor were treated with a single i.v. injection of free MTX, non-targeted MTX-HSA NPs and LHRH targeted MTX-HSA NPs. LHRH targeted MTX-HSA nanoparticles showed stronger anti-tumor activity in vivo. By 7 days after treatment, average tumor volume in the LHRH targeted MTX-HSA NPs treated group decreased to 8.67% of the initial tumor volume when the number of attached LHRH molecules on MTX-HSA NPs was the highest, while the average tumor volume in non-targeted MTX-HSA NPs treated mice grew rapidly and reached 250.7% of the initial tumor volume 7 days after the treatment. LHRH targeted MTX-HSA NPs could significantly extend the survival time of tumor bearing mice compared with the non-targeted MTX-HSA NPs and free MTX formulations. "
"Abstract: The aim of this work was to perform a pilot study on the safety and efficacy of nanoparticle formulation for cosmetic application. The encapsulated actives in the nanoparticles were a blend of coenzyme Q10, retinyl palmitate, tocopheryl acetate, grape seed oil and linseed oil. The nanoparticle suspension was characterized in terms of pH and particle size. For the safety assessment, alternative methods as cytotoxicity and HET CAM were used. The clinical skin compatibility tests were also performed. The efficacy was evaluated in healthy volunteers presenting different degrees of periorbital wrinkles. Skin hydration was performed by corneometry. The nanoparticles presented narrow size around 140 nm and pH close to neutral and were suitable to cutaneous application. The alternative tests demonstrated that the nanoparticles did not present potential to induce skin irritant effects, cytotoxicity or generate oxidative stress. The clinical assays confirmed the in vitro results, demonstrating the safety of the nanoparticles, which were not irritant, sensitizing and comedogenic. Furthermore, the exposure to UVA light did not cause photoxicity. Regarding the efficacy, nanoparticles presented significant reduction in wrinkle degree after 21 days of application compared to the control. The volunteers could differentiate the nanoparticles and the control product by means of subjective analyses. In conclusion, the nanoparticles containing antioxidant actives were safe for topical use and presented anti-aging activity in vivo and are suitable to be used as cosmetic ingredient. "
"Abstract: Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), such as cyclosporin A and tacrolimus, are the cornerstone of maintenance immunosuppressive regimens in liver transplantation. CNIs prevent rejection by inhibition of calcineurin, via which lymphocyte proliferation and interleukin (IL)-2 production is prevented. Tacrolimus is now the first-choice immunosuppressant after liver transplantation, since it is associated with fewer episodes of rejection than cyclosporin A. In this review we will discuss interindividual differences, which influence tacrolimus metabolism. Because of these factors and the narrow therapeutic index of tacrolimus, monitoring of drug trough levels is necessary. Furthermore, we will discuss studies concerning conversion from the tacrolimus twice daily to tacrolimus once daily formulation in stable LT patients. Due to adverse effects of CNIs, such as chronic renal failure, hypertension, de novo malignancy and new-onset diabetes mellitus, CNI minimization strategies have been developed, which will be discussed too. "
"Abstract: Personal care products (PCP) often contain micron- or nano-sized formulation components, such as nanoemulsions or microscopic vesicles. A large number of studies suggest that such vesicles do not penetrate human skin beyond the superficial layers of the stratum corneum. Nano-sized PCP formulations may enhance or reduce skin absorption of ingredients, albeit at a limited scale. Modern sunscreens contain insoluble titanium dioxide (TiO₂) or zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NP), which are efficient filters of UV light. A large number of studies suggest that insoluble NP do not penetrate into or through human skin. A number of in vivo toxicity tests, including in vivo intravenous studies, showed that TiO₂ and ZnO NP are non-toxic and have an excellent skin tolerance. Cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, photo-genotoxicity, general toxicity and carcinogenicity studies on TiO₂ and ZnO NP found no difference in the safety profile of micro- or nano-sized materials, all of which were found to be non-toxic. Although some published in vitro studies on insoluble nano- or micron-sized particles suggested cell uptake, oxidative cell damage or genotoxicity, these data are consistent with those from micron-sized particles and should be interpreted with caution. Data on insoluble NP, such as surgical implant-derived wear debris particles or intravenously administered magnetic resonance contrast agents suggest that toxicity of small particles is generally related to their chemistry rather than their particle size. Overall, the weight of scientific evidence suggests that insoluble NP used in sunscreens pose no or negligible risk to human health, but offer large health benefits, such as the protection of human skin against UV-induced skin ageing and cancer.

"Abstract: The determination of appropriate dosing regimens for the treatment of infants and very young children with cancer represents a major challenge in paediatric oncology. Whereas dose reductions are commonplace for many chemotherapeutics in this patient group, the appropriateness of dose reductions for drugs is unclear when the limited number of published studies reporting on pharmacokinetics in infant patient populations are considered. Developmental physiological changes, potentially impacting significantly on drug disposition, occur throughout childhood, with a number of important changes observed within the first few weeks from birth. The current review focuses on the developmental physiology of preterm babies and infants and the potential impact of physiological changes on drug disposition, clinical response and toxicity. Dose reductions for a number of important anticancer drugs are compared between tumour types and clinical protocols. Where data exist, differences in pharmacokinetics between infants and older children are highlighted. In addition, the impact of confounding factors relating to the availability of appropriate drug formulations and ethical challenges concerning the conduct of clinical pharmacology studies in infant patient populations are addressed. As many currently used drugs are highly likely to be important in the treatment of cancer in infants and young children for the foreseeable future, it would seem advantageous for appropriately planned population pharmacokinetic studies to be carried out in this patient population.

"Abstract: Cornea transplantation is one of the most performed graft procedures worldwide with an impressive success rate of 90%. However, for ""high-risk"" patients with particular ocular diseases in addition to the required surgery, the success rate is drastically reduced to 50%. In these cases, cyclosporin A (CsA) is frequently used to prevent the cornea rejection by a systemic treatment with possible systemic side effects for the patients. To overcome these problems, it is a challenge to prepare well-tolerated topical CsA formulations. Normally high amounts of oils or surfactants are needed for the solubilization of the very hydrophobic CsA. Furthermore, it is in general difficult to obtain ocular therapeutic drug levels with topical instillations due to the corneal barriers that efficiently protect the intraocular structures from foreign substances thus also from drugs. The aim of this study was to investigate in vivo the effects of a novel CsA topical aqueous formulation. This formulation was based on nanosized polymeric micelles as drug carriers. An established rat model for the prevention of cornea graft rejection after a keratoplasty procedure was used. After instillation of the novel formulation with fluorescent labeled micelles, confocal analysis of flat-mounted corneas clearly showed that the nanosized carriers were able to penetrate into all corneal layers. The efficacy of a 0.5% CsA micelle formulation was tested and compared to a physiological saline solution and to a systemic administration of CsA. In our studies, the topical CsA treatment was carried out for 14 days, and the three parameters (a) cornea transparency, (b) edema, and (c) neovascularization were evaluated by clinical observation and scoring. Compared to the control group, the treated group showed a significant higher cornea transparency and significant lower edema after 7 and 13 days of the surgery. At the end point of the study, the neovascularization was reduced by 50% in the CsA-micelle treated animals. The success rate of cornea graft transplantation was 73% in treated animals against 25% for the control group. This result was as good as observed for a systemic CsA treatment in the same animal model. This new formulation has the same efficacy like a systemic treatment but without the serious CsA systemic side effects. Ocular drug levels of transplanted and healthy rat eyes were dosed by UPLC/MS and showed a high CsA value in the cornea (11710 ± 7530 ng(CsA)/g(tissue) and 6470 ± 1730 ng(CsA)/g(tissue), respectively). In conclusion, the applied formulation has the capacity to overcome the ocular surface barriers, the micelles formed a drug reservoir in the cornea from, where a sustained release of CsA can take place. This novel formulation for topical application of CsA is clearly an effective and well-tolerated alternative to the systemic treatment for the prevention of corneal graft rejection. "
"Abstract: After deposition in the respiratory tract, nanoparticles exhibit acute, neutrophil-driven inflammatory and oxidative reactions, fibrotic responses and in chronic studies under overload conditions carcinogenic effects, more severely than the microscaled materials of the same chemistry. Besides these effects also known to be induced by microsized particles, nanoparticles principally can translocate from the site of exposure to circulation and become systemically available. This may either increase the toxic outcome (e.g. cardio-vascular effects and potential responses in remote organs) or facilitate an elimination of nanomaterials. For example, in combination with partial dissolution, a strong lung response after a short-term inhalative exposure may be followed by a rapid recovery effect. Mechanistically, in vitro and in vivo tests demonstrated that nanoparticles induce inflammation and oxidative stress after interaction with macrophages and lung epithelial cells; consequently, a cytotoxic and genotoxic potential may exist. The deposition, retention and clearance behaviour of inhaled nanomaterials and the toxic effects observed are decisively dependent on the particle agglomeration status of the aerosol. Two principally different experimental approaches are used for inhalative exposure to nanoparticles: either (1) a basic research-oriented approach using very small aerosol mass concentrations or particle formulations that result in at least partially nanoscaled aerosols; in this way, the potential hazard and the translocation potential for individual nanoparticles can be followed effectively; or (2) exposure scenarios mimicking the occupational situation (risk-oriented) with mostly agglomerated nanoparticles; consequently, the probable risk deriving from incidental/accidental exposure can be assessed more adequately.

"BACKGROUND: Moderate-to-severe allergic rhinitis (AR) is a challenge to treat, with many patients using multiple therapies and achieving limited symptom control. More effective therapies must be developed and tested in well-controlled, randomized, prospective studies with a direct comparison to current standards. OBJECTIVES: The aim of these studies was to investigate the efficacy of MP29-02 (a novel formulation of azelastine and fluticasone propionate [FP]) in patients with moderate-to-severe seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) and to compare its efficacy with 2 first-line therapies (ie, intranasal azelastine and intranasal FP) in this population. METHODS: Three thousand three hundred ninety-eight patients (≥12 years old) with moderate-to-severe SAR were enrolled into 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group trials (MP4002 [NCT00651118], MP4004 [NCT00740792], and MP4006 [NCT00883168]). Each trial was conducted for 14 days during different allergy seasons. The primary efficacy variable was the sum of the morning and evening change from baseline in reflective total nasal symptom score (range, 0-24) over the treatment period. Outcomes for the meta-analysis included efficacy according to disease severity and time to response in relevant responder criteria. RESULTS: In the meta-analysis MP29-02 reduced the mean reflective total nasal symptom score from baseline (-5.7 [SD, 5.3]) more than FP (-5.1 [SD, 4.9], P < .001), azelastine (-4.4 [SD, 4.8], P < .001), or placebo (-3.0 [SD, 4.2], P < .001). This benefit was observed from the first day of assessment, with improvement in each individual nasal symptom, even in the patients with the most severe disease. MP29-02 achieved response consistently days earlier and showed greater efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe rhinitis than FP and azelastine. CONCLUSIONS: MP29-02 represents a novel therapy that demonstrated superiority to 2 first-line therapies for AR. Patients with moderate-to-severe SAR achieved better control, and their symptoms were controlled earlier with MP29-02 than with recommended medications according to guidelines. "
"Abstract: The present study explores prospective of surface tailored nanoparticles for targeted delivery of acyclovir along with the interception of minimal side effects. Acyclovir loaded plain and galactosylated poly lectic co glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles were efficiently prepared and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, and entrapment efficiency. The formulations were evaluated for in vitro drug release and hemolysis. Further, biodistribution study and fluorescent microscopic studies were carried out to determine the targeting potential of formulations. SEM revealed smooth morphology and spherical shape of the nanoparticles. In vitro, the galactosylated nanoparticles were found to be least hemolytic and exhibited a sustained release pattern. In vivo studies exhibited an augmented bioavailability, increased residence time and enhanced delivery of acyclovir to the liver upon galactosylation. It may therefore be concluded that galactose conjugated PLGA nanoparticles can be used suitably as vehicles for delivery of bioactives specifically to the hepatic tissues and may be thus exploited in the effective management of various liver disorders.

"INTRODUCTION: Topical anesthetics are frequently used to decrease the pain associated with a variety of procedures including cutaneous surgery, cosmetic treatments and laser surgery. They are also routinely used in children prior to invasive procedures, such as venipuncture. The ideal topical anesthetic should safely increase patient comfort associated with these procedures with minimal potential for adverse effects. AREAS COVERED: Topical anesthetic formulations have evolved over the past several decades to include formulations with improved efficacy and side effect profiles. However, significant adverse events are still possible. EXPERT OPINION: Medical practitioners can mitigate the risk of side effects and toxicity with careful selection of anesthetic type, concentration, body location and dermatologic procedure. Compounded formulations should be used with caution in medical settings only on limited body surface areas without occlusion. This review presents a detailed analysis of products available, reported complications and an outline for appropriate use of topical anesthetics in combination with dermatologic procedures. "
"BACKGROUND: Topical combination therapy containing a retinoid and an antimicrobial is an effective treatment for acne vulgaris. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new topical formulation containing clindamycin phosphate 1.2% and tretinoin 0.025% solubilized in an aqueous-based gel (CT gel). METHODS: 1,649 participants were randomized 2:2:2:1 to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with CT gel, clindamycin, tretinoin, or vehicle gel administered once daily. RESULTS: Significantly more participants achieved 2-grade or greater improvement on the Investigator's Static Global Assessment score with CT gel versus clindamycin, tretinoin, or vehicle gel. CT gel produced a significantly greater reduction in absolute number of total lesions versus all other treatment groups, in total and noninflammatory lesions versus clindamycin, and in total and inflammatory lesions versus tretinoin. Local tolerability was similar to that of tretinoin alone; signs and symptoms of irritation were most notable at week 2. There were no more adverse events with CT gel than with tretinoin gel. CONCLUSION: CT gel is more effective than clindamycin or tretinoin monotherapy, with a safety and tolerability profile similar to that of tretinoin. "
"Abstract: Co-administration of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors such as cyclosporine A (CyA) and its analogue valspodar with doxorubicin (DOX) can result in diminished clearance of DOX, leading to accentuated toxicity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the effect of these P-gp inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of DOX can be avoided through their encapsulation in polymeric micelles. Cyclosporine A or valspodar was physically encapsulated in methoxypoly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone) (PEO-b-PCL) micelles using co-solvent evaporation method. The commercially available DOX was administered as a single dose of 5mg/kg intravenously to Sprague-Dawley rats either alone or 30min following a single intravenous dose (10mg/kg) of either CyA or valspodar as part of conventional or polymeric micellar formulation. Co-administration of DOX with either Sandimmune® or valspodar in the conventional Cremophor EL-based formulation was associated with greater than 50% reduction in DOX clearance (CL). Although there was nearly 40% reduction in the CL of DOX with the polymeric micellar formulation of CyA, there was only 6% reduction in CL of DOX upon co-administration with the polymeric micellar formulation of valspodar. In conclusion, encapsulation of cyclosporines, particularly valspodar, in polymeric micelles was shown to reduce their effects on the pharmacokinetics of DOX in rat. "
"Abstract: Mometasone furoate, a potent glucocorticoid (class III) with a favorable benefit/risk ratio, has emerged as a standard medication for the treatment of inflammatory skin disorders. The purpose of the investigation presented here was to determine the noninferiority of a topical mometasone formulation, a light cream (O/W 60/40 emulsion) with mometasone furoate 0.1% (water content of 33%) versus marketed comparators. Using the vasoconstrictor assay, a strong blanching effect of the new cream (called Mometasone cream) comparable to that of a mometasone comparator, a fatty cream with mometasone furoate 0.1%, could be demonstrated. Thus, the topical bioavailability of the active ingredient mometasone furoate (0.1%) was regarded to be similar for Mometasone cream and the mometasone comparator. Using the psoriasis plaque test, a strong antipsoriatic effect comparable to that of the mometasone comparator was found for Mometasone cream after 12 days of occlusive treatment. A nearly identical reduction in the mean infiltrate thickness and similar mean AUC values were noted with both formulations confirmed by clinical assessment data. The noninferiority of Mometasone cream to its active comparator with respect to the AUC of change to baseline in infiltrate thickness was demonstrated. Both medications were well tolerated. Overall, Mometasone cream and the mometasone comparator showed similar efficacy and tolerability. Mometasone cream, in addition to its high potency and good tolerability, provides the properties of a light cream, which might make this new medication particularly suitable for application on acutely inflamed and sensitive skin.

"Abstract: The introduction of new topical drugs based on new chemical entities has become a rare event. Instead, pharmaceutical companies have been focused on reformulating existing drugs resulting in an ever-growing number of topical drug products for every approved drug substance. In light of this trend, soon reformulations may not be as rewarding to their sponsors as they are today unless they offer a substantial improvement over other formulations of the same drug substance and the same indication, namely improved efficacy over existing drugs, reduced side effects, unique drug combinations, or applicability for new indications. This article reviews and compares topical drug delivery systems currently under active research that are designed to offer such advantages in the coming years. The reviewed delivery systems are: liposomes, niosomes, transferosomes, ethosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, cyclodextrin, and sol-gel microcapsules. Among all the topical drug delivery systems currently undergoing active research, only the sol-gel microencapsulation is at clinical stages. "
"Abstract: This study was designed to compare the rate and extent of absorption of 2 oral formulations of ondansetron (CAS 99614-02-5) 8 mg orodispersible tablets in healthy volunteers. 22 subjects were administered ondansetron orodispersible tablets of test and reference formulation in a single-dose, 2-period, 2-sequence, fasting, open-label, crossover and randomised study. Plasma concentrations were determined by LC/MS/MS. Log-transformed AUCs and Cmax values were tested for bioequivalence based on the ratios of the geometric means (test/reference). Tmax was analysed nonparametrically. The 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean values for the test/reference ratios for AUC0-t and Cmax were within the bioequivalence acceptance range of 80-125%. According to the European Guideline [1] it may be therefore concluded that test formulation of ondansetron 8 mg orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to the reference formulation. "
"RATIONALE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of a fixed-dose combination of mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate (MF/F) administered via a metered-dose inhaler in subjects with moderate-to-very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial had a 26-week treatment period and a 26-week safety extension. Subjects (n = 1196), at least 40 years old, were current or ex-smokers randomized to twice-daily inhaled MF/F 400/10 μg, MF/F 200/10 μg, MF 400 μg, F 10 μg, or placebo. The trial's co-primary endpoints were mean changes from baseline, as area under the curve (AUC), in forced expiratory volume (FEV(1)) over 0-12 hours (AUC(0-12 h) FEV(1)) with MF/F versus MF, and in morning (AM) pre-dose (trough) FEV(1) with MF/F versus F after 13 weeks of treatment. Key secondary endpoints were the effects of MF/F on respiratory health status using the Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), symptom-free nights, partly stable COPD at 26 weeks, and time to first COPD exacerbation. RESULTS: The largest improvements in AUC(0-12 h) FEV(1) were observed with MF/F 400/10 μg and MF/F 200/10 μg. Serial spirometry results demonstrated that bronchodilator effects with MF/F occurred rapidly (within 5 minutes), persisted for 12 hours after dosing, and were sustained over the 26-week treatment period. Similar findings were observed for AM pre-dose FEV(1), for which effects were further investigated, excluding subjects whose AM FEV(1) data were incorrectly collected after 2 days from the last dose of study treatment. Improvements in SGRQ scores surpassed the minimum clinically important difference of more than four units with both MF/F treatments. At 26 weeks, no notable between-treatment differences in the occurrence and nature of adverse events (AEs) were reported. No unexpected AEs were observed. Overall, 90 subjects reported AEs considered to be treatment-related, the most common of which were lenticular opacities, dysphonia, and oral candidiasis. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, MF/F treatments improved lung function and respiratory health status, reduced exacerbations, and were well tolerated in subjects with moderate-to-very severe COPD. "
"INTRODUCTION: Sun protection, particularly the appropriate use of sunscreens is an important modifiable risk factor in the prevention of skin cancers. Our aim was to assess the current knowledge levels regarding sun protection, across plastic surgeons in the UK. METHODS: A 12-point questionnaire based on the points contained in the patient information packs on sun protection produced by the British Association of Dermatology was circulated electronically amongst 551 BAPRAS members. We received 73 responses (13.3%). Questions were formulated around the basic information patients would expect to receive from a skin cancer specialist at the time of the diagnosis. RESULTS: On average, participants could answer only 52.4% of the questions correctly. Only 9.7% (95% CI 3-17) of participants could accurately quantify the role of UV exposure in causation of melanoma. A total of 37.5% correctly identified the duration of action of sunscreen to be 3-4 h. Half of the participants were not aware that geographical conditions like altitude and latitude, as well as shade, could alter sun protection. A similar number could not answer questions related to the protective action of clothing. CONCLUSION: As principal stakeholders in the treatment and outcomes of skin cancer patients, plastic surgeons could be at the forefront of influencing patients' behaviour regarding sun protection measures. The results demonstrate a need for better awareness and education regarding the knowledge of sunscreens and UV protection. Improved education would lead to health benefits for patients and their relatives and influence the primary prevention of this enlarging health issue of skin cancer. "
"BACKGROUND: Cyclosporine (CsA) remains a mainstay of immunosuppressive maintenance regimens in developing countries, but its effects on long-term kidney allograft survival are still unclear. Our aim was to assess a generic microemulsion CsA (Sigmasporin) for long-term impact on graft function and patient survival among stable renal transplant patients. METHODS: Over a 36-month period, patients with transplantations from >6 months earlier were maintained on CsA doses of 2-8 mg/kg/d to keep C(2) within the recommended therapeutic range. We assessed 25 efficacy and tolerability parameters of scheduled intervals. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (9 female, 18 male) from 6 centers in 4 Middle-Eastern countries were enrolled between 2004 and 2009. Their average age was 35.1 ± 9.8 years, body mass index ranged from 15.7 to 41.2 kg/m(2), and average time from transplantation was 2.2 ± 1.6 years. Within the 36-month observation period the CsA dose was reduced by 17.3% from 2.89 ± 0.88 mg/kg/d to achieve C(2) levels of 600-1000 ng/mL. After 36 months the glomerular filtration rate declined by 8.2% from an overall baseline mean of 72.7 ± 23.5 mL/min/1.73 m(2). It improved in 11.1% of patients and remained unchanged in 44.4%. No new cases of hypertension or diabetes mellitus were reported, and there was 1 case of borderline hyperlipidemia. Graft functions were stable, apart from 2 incidences of CsA nephrotoxicity. Both graft and patient 3-year survival rates were 100%. CONCLUSIONS: On a 3-year basis, Sigmasporin Microral was effective to maintain stable renal functions in kidney transplant patients, with safety and tolerability profiles similar to those reported in the international literature. "
"AIMS: We aimed to demonstrate that Hypericin, a component of St. Johns Wort, selectively visualizes malignant gliomas. Hypericin is known as one of the most powerful photosensitizers in nature with excellent fluorescent properties. METHODS: In five patients with a recurrence of a malignant glioma a newly developed water soluble formulation of hypericin was given intravenously (0.1 mg/kg body weight) 6 h before the surgical procedure. Tumor resection was performed under white light and fluorescence mode. The intensity grade of the tissue fluorescence was categorisized by the surgeon in three grades, highly fluorescent, weakly fluorescent and not fluorescent. In these areas tissue samples were taken and investigated by two blinded independent neuropathologists. Tissue samples were histologically classified differentiating between tumor tissue, tumor necrosis, tissue with scattered tumor cells and normal brain tissue. RESULTS: In all patients tumor tissue was clearly distinguishable by its typically red fluorescence color from normal brain tissue which was colored blue under a special fluorescent filter. Histological evaluation of the 110 tissue samples showed a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 91% for one of the two neuropathologists, whereas specificity for second pathologist was 90% and sensitivity 94%. The i.v. application of Hypericin proofed to be safe in all cases and there were no side effects observed. CONCLUSION: Hypericin in its water soluble form is a well tolerated drug. In addition to its high photosensitizing properties hypericin will open up interesting new therapeutic possibilities especially when used in combination with fluorescence detection and simultaneously photodynamic therapy.

"INTRODUCTION: Uses of methotrexate (MTX) are well established for the treatment of various types of malignancy, psoriasis, rheumatological diseases and the medical termination of pregnancy. Formulation and targeting approaches for MTX with controlled release carriers, multiparticulate systems, prodrug and drug conjugates have been found to improve bioavailability, reduce adverse effects and maximize clinical efficacy, compared with conventional methods. AREAS COVERED: This exhaustive literature survey on different electronic databases covers drug delivery and clinical trials on MTX. This review deals with the challenges and achievements of controlled release, multiparticulate, prodrug and drug conjugate systems of MTX. EXPERT OPINION: Therapeutic drug monitoring of MTX is crucial to attain a good efficacy. In spite of the advantages of multiparticulate, prodrug and drug conjugates, clinical applications of such formulations of MTX are still under infancy. These drug delivery systems require the special attention of medical experts for its wider clinical usage, and pharmaceutical experts for its scale-up. The combination of MTX with other antineoplastic and immunosuppressants should also be subjected to clinical trials, such as the combination of misoprostol with MTX in abortion. "
"Abstract: Tretinoin (TRE) or all-trans retinoic acid is employed in the topical treatment of various skin diseases including acne and psoriasis. However, its use is strongly limited by side effects and high chemical instability. TRE encapsulation in nanostructured systems reduces these problems. Chitosan is a biopolymer that exhibits a number of interesting properties such as bioadhesion and antibacterial activity. The aim of this work was to prepare and characterize solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) containing TRE, with and without addition of chitosan, to assess their in vitro cytotoxicity in keratinocytes and to evaluate their antibacterial activity against bacteria related to acne. SLN without (SLN-TRE) and with (SLN-chitosan-TRE) chitosan were prepared by hot high pressure homogenization. The hydrodynamic mean diameter and zeta potential were 162.7±1.4 nm and -31.9±2.0 mV for SLN-TRE, and 284.8±15.0 nm and 55.9±3.1 mV for SLN-chitosan-TRE. The SLN-chitosan-TRE exhibited high encapsulation efficiency, high physical stability in the tested period (one year), were not cytotoxic to keratinocytes and showed high antibacterial activity against P. acnes and S. aureus. Therefore chitosan-SLN can be good candidates to encapsulate TRE and to increase its therapeutic efficacy in the topical treatment of acne. "
"BACKGROUND: Renal dysfunction in allograft transplant is common and its assessment is done using Revised Banff '97 working classification, which is the accepted formulation for the evaluation of histological appearance of renal allograft biopsies. The nonrejection category under the Banff working classification of renal allograft pathology forms a large group resulting in allograft dysfunction. AIM: To evaluate the spectrum of histopathological changes seen in renal allograft dysfunction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 119 renal biopsies were studied over 10 years presenting with renal allograft dysfunction from a tertiary center in North India. RESULTS: Majority of the biopsies were in the nonrejection category (47.1%), which included few cases of acute tubular necrosis (25.2%), cyclosporine nephrotoxicity (16%), infections (10.9%), and thrombotic microangiopathy (3.4%). The second largest category in our study was acute/active cellular rejection group (31.9%), which displayed moderate to severe tubulitis, mononuclear cell infiltrate in the interstitium, and vasculitis. Antibody-mediated rejection cases were seen in 28.6% of the renal biopsies followed by chronic allograft nephropathy cases (12.6%) showing features of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Borderline changes with features of mild tubulitis contributed to 7.6% of the biopsies. The smallest group comprised of only 4.2%, which were within normal histological limits. CONCLUSION: Timely accurate diagnosis of renal allograft dysfunction is essential for prompt, effective management of renal transplant patients. Thus, nonrejection pathology forms a significant cause of renal dysfunction in patients with renal allograft transplantation. "
"Abstract: Intranasal corticosteroids (INSs) are the most efficacious medication for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. In 2006, the Joint Task Force of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, published a white paper on the potential over-the-counter switch of INS (Bielory L, Blaiss M, Fineman SM, et al. Concerns about intranasal corticosteroids for over-the-counter use: Position statement of the Joint Task Force for the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology and the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol 96:514-525, 2006). The concern of the paper was the safety of the use of these agents without oversight by a health care professional. The objective of this paper was to review published literature on the safety of INS since the publication of the task force white paper. Recent studies, which evaluated topical and systemic adverse events associated with ciclesonide (CIC), fluticasone furoate (FF), mometasone furoate (MF), triamcinolone acetonide, fluticasone propionate, budesonide, and beclomethasone dipropionate were summarized. In general, no significant topical or systemic complications were observed in these studies, although none were >1 year in duration. The newer formulations of topical corticosteroids for allergic rhinitis, such as CIC, FF, and MF, which have less systemic bioavailability, may be safer for long-term use. New studies continue to add to the reassurance of the safety of INSs in the treatment of allergic rhinitis but still do not answer the question if these agents are appropriate for long-term use without oversight by a health care professional.

"Abstract: A panel of in vitro tests intended for evaluation of the nano-sized drug delivery systems' compliance with human blood was applied to liposomal formulations of anticancer lipophilic prodrugs incorporated into the lipid bilayer. Liposomes on the basis of natural phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), 8:1 (mol) were loaded with 10 mol% of either methotrexate or melphalan 1,2-dioleoylglyceride esters (MTX-DOG and Mlph-DOG respectively) and either decorated with 2 mol% of sialyl Lewis X/A (SiaLe(X/A)) tetrasaccharide ligand or not. Hemolysis rate, red blood cells and platelets integrity and size distribution, complement (C) activation, and coagulation cascade functioning were analyzed upon the material incubation with whole blood. Both formulations were negatively charged with the zeta potential value being higher in the case of MTX-DOG liposomes, which also were larger than Mlph-DOG liposomes and more prone to aggregation. Accordingly, in hemocompatibility tests Mlph-DOG liposomes did not provoke any undesirable effects, while MTX-DOG liposomes induced significant C activation and abnormal coagulation times in a concentration-dependent manner. Reactivity of the liposome surface was not affected by the presence of SiaLe(X/A) or PI. Decrease in liposome loading with MTX-DOG from 10 to 2.5% resulted in lower surface charge density, smaller liposome size and considerably reduced impact on C activation and coagulation cascades. "

"Abstract: The present study discusses design of doxorubicin hydrochloride (Dox) loaded lipid based nanocarrier (LIPOMER) for oral delivery. High entrapment (>90 %) and high loading (38.11 ± 0.37 %w/w) of hydrophilic Dox in lipid nanocarrier of polyglyceryl-6-distearate was achieved using poly(methyl vinyl ether-co-maleic anhydride) (Gantrez AN 119) and a modified nanoprecipitation method. Dox-LIPOMER revealed nanosize (314 ± 16.80 nm) and negative zeta potential (-25.00 ± 2.41 mV). Dox-LIPOMER exhibits sustained release in vitro and was influenced by ionic strength of dissolution medium. DSC and XRD studies suggested amorphous nature of Dox in LIPOMER. TEM revealed spherical morphology of Dox-LIPOMER. Dox-LIPOMER was stable up to 12 months at 25 °C/60 % RH. A 384 % enhancement in oral bioavailability compared to Dox solution was observed following Dox-LIPOMER administration at 10 mg/kg body weight. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) assay data of heart and kidney tissues of rats treated with Dox-LIPOMER were comparable with untreated rats. Dox-LIPOMER represents a potential safe drug delivery system for oral administration. "
"BACKGROUND:   Ultraviolet radiations generate reactive oxygen species, leading to adverse effects on skin properties. Botanical extracts are multifunctional in nature having various properties like photoprotection, anti-aging, moisturizing, antioxidant, astringent, anti-irritant, and antimicrobial activity. AIMS:   The aim of this study was to formulate creams having Curcuma longa extract loaded novel vesicular systems (liposomes, ethosomes, and transfersomes) and study their photoprotective effect by assessment of skin hydration (Cutometer) and sebum content (Sebumeter). METHODS:   The alcoholic C. longa extract loaded liposomes, ethosomes, and transfersomes having 0.5-2.0% w/w extract were prepared, evaluated for size, entrapment efficiency, and incorporated into the cream. Their long-term interaction with skin (6 weeks) was compared in terms of their effects on skin hydration and sebum content. RESULTS:   Vesicular size obtained was in the range 167.3 ± 3.0 to 262.4 ± 2.4 nm with low polydispersity index (0.2-0.3) and high entrapment efficiency. The efficacy was in the order C. longa extract loaded transfersomal creams > C. longa extract loaded ethosomal creams > C. longa extract loaded liposomal creams > C. longa extract loaded creams > Empty transfersome loaded cream > Empty ethosome loaded cream > Empty liposome loaded cream > Base cream. CONCLUSIONS:   The photoprotective properties of the constituents of C. longa extract and hydrant, moisturizing lipid components of nano vesicles with better skin penetration resulted in improvement in skin properties like skin hydration and sebum content. The herbal extract loaded nano vesicles incorporated in cream could be used as photoprotective formulations. "
"BACKGROUND: Chronic ultraviolet (UV) exposure is a major environmental factor involved in extrinsic skin ageing (photo-ageing). Skin nerve fibres are significantly reduced in number following UV irradiation and new skincare compounds with neuroprotective effects are thus highly warranted. OBJECTIVES: We developed a new skincare formulation from a plant extract and evaluated its neuroprotective effects of ex vivo UV irradiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The new skincare emulsion was formulated from Echinacea purpurea extract and was enriched with antioxidants (patent no. PROV020110087075). Skin samples were obtained from 20 healthy patients enrolled for plastic surgery and were immediately treated with placebo (SPF 15) or test emulsions. Skin samples were exposed to UVA and UVB for 60 min. Nerve fibres were identified by immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody, anti-human CD56. Cell damage was quantified by image analysis. RESULTS: UVA and UVB significantly reduced (40-60%) densities of nerve endings in control samples treated with placebo (P < 0.001). Samples treated with test emulsion completely blocked UV-related effects on skin nerve endings. These neuroprotective effects were similarly observed regardless of age or tissue analysed (breast versus abdomen). CONCLUSIONS: Our new skincare formulation obtained from E. purpurea provides important neuroprotective effects of UV irradiation and could be used together with SPFs to prevent chronic deleterious effects of solar exposure.

"Abstract: Sulphur mustard (SM) is a bifunctional alkylating agent that causes cutaneous blisters in human and animals. Remedies to SM-induced dermatotoxicity are still in experimental stage. Due to inevitable requirement of a wound-healing formulation against SM-induced skin lesions, efficacy of formulations including povidone iodine, Aloe vera gel, betaine or framycetin sulphate was evaluated in present study. SM was applied percutaneously (5 mg/kg) once on back region of Swiss albino mice; and after 24 hours, DRDE/WH-02 (Defence Research and Development Establishment/ Wound Healant- 02, containing polyvinylpyrrolidone [PVP], A. vera gel and betaine), Ovadine, Soframycin or A. vera gel were applied topically, daily for 3 or 7 days in different groups. Skin sections were subjected to histopathology, histomorphologic grading, tissue leukocytosis, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay and immunohistochemistry of inflammatory-reparative biomarkers. DRDE/WH-02 treated mice received highest score on the basis of histomorphologic scale and lowest number of TUNEL-positive cells compared to other groups. DRDE/WH-02 showed better wound healing as evidenced by widespread re-epithelialization, homogenous fibroplasias well supported by the expression of transforming growth factor-α, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and fibroblast growth factor. Upregulation of interleukin 6 in DRDE/WH-02-treated mice skin resulted in increased tissue leukocytosis and an early removal of tissue debris that initiated reparative process at faster rate compared to other groups. In conclusion, DRDE/WH-02 provided better healing effect and can be recommended as an effective wound healant against SM-induced skin injury. "
"BACKGROUND: Topical fixed-combination therapy containing 1% clindamycin as 1.2% clindamycin phosphate (CLNP) and 3% benzoyl peroxide (BPO) is an effective treatment for acne vulgaris (acne). OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate that the combination of 1.2% CLNP with lower strength BPO (CLNP 1.2%-BPO 3%) in a gel formulation is superior to each individual ingredient, CLNP 1.2% and BPO 3%, and vehicle gel. METHODS: A total of 1,319 patients with acne, aged 12 years or older, were enrolled and randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive CLNP 1.2%-BPO 3%, CLNP 1.2% gel, BPO 3% gel, or vehicle gel once-daily in a 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled study. Subjects were evaluated at baseline, weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 or early termination. Assessment of efficacy was evaluated using a six-point Investigator's Static Global Assessment (ISGA) and Subject's Global Assessment (SGA) of acne severity and lesion counts (inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total). Safety assessments included skin tolerability and adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: A greater proportion of subjects who used CLNP 1.2%-BPO 3% gel (39%) had a two grade improvement in ISGA from baseline to week 12 compared with CLNP 1.2% (25%; P<0.001), BPO 3% (30%; P=0.016), and vehicle (18%; P<0.001). CLNP 1.2%- BPO 3% was superior to CLNP 1.2% and vehicle alone in the absolute reduction from baseline to week 12 in all three lesion types (P<0.001 all pair-wise comparisons). CLNP 1.2%-BPO 3% was superior to BPO 3% alone in the absolute reduction from baseline to week 12 in inflammatory (P=0.015) and total (P=0.032) lesion counts. The incidence of product-related AEs was low and similar in all study groups (1% with CLNP 1.2%-BPO 3%, 2% with CLNP 1.2%, 2% with BPO 3%, and 2% with vehicle). Local tolerability assessments showed similar minimal changes from baseline to week 12 in all study groups. CONCLUSION: CLNP 1.2%-BPO 3% gel provides superior efficacy to improve ISGA score and reduce inflammatory and total lesion counts compared with the individual active ingredients (CLNP 1.2% and BPO 3%) and vehicle, while maintaining a highly favorable safety and tolerability profile similar to BPO 3% alone.

"BACKGROUND: Diseases that affect the buccal cavity are a public health concern nowadays. Chlorhexidine and nystatin are the most commonly used drugs for the control of buccal affections. In the search for more effective antimicrobials, nanotechnology can be successfully used to improve the physical chemical properties of drugs whilst avoiding the undesirable side effects associated with its use. Herein described are studies using nystatin and chlorhexidine with sodium montmorillonite (MMTNa), and chlorhexidine with β-cyclodextrin and two derivatives methyl-β-cyclodextrin and hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin in the development of antimicrobial nanosystems. METHODS: The nanosystems were prepared by kneading and solubilization followed by freeze-drying technique. The nanosystems were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Nanosystem antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans strains was evaluated with inhibition halo analysis. RESULTS: The nanocarriers MMTNa and cyclodextrins showed good yields. XRPD, FTIR, and DSC analysis confirmed the proposed nanosystems formation and the suitability of the production methods. The nanosystems that showed best antimicrobial effect were chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) and cyclodextrin inclusion complexes and CHX:MMTNa 60% cation exchange capacity - 24 hours. CONCLUSION: The nanosystem formulations present higher stability for all chlorhexidine inclusion complexes compared with pure chlorhexidine. The nystatin nanosystems have the potential to mask the bitter taste, justifying subsequent in-vivo studies. For these reasons, further studies are being carried out to evaluate their application in professional formulations. "
"Abstract: The use of degradable composite materials in orthopedics remains a field of intense research due to their ability to support new bone formation and degrade in a controlled manner, broadening their use for orthopedic applications. Poly (lactide-co-glycolide) acid (PLGA), a degradable biopolymer, is now a popular material for different orthopedic applications and is proposed for use in tissue engineering scaffolds either alone or combined with bioactive ceramics. Interference screws composed of calcium phosphates and PLGA are readily available in the market. However, some reports highlight problems of screw migration or aseptic cyst formation following screw degradation. In order to understand these phenomena and to help to improve implant formulation, we have evaluated the effects of PLGA degradation products: lactic acid and glycolic acid on human osteoblasts in vitro. Cell proliferation, differentiation, and matrix mineralization, important for bone healing were studied. It was found that the toxicity of polymer degradation products under buffering conditions was limited to high concentrations. However, non-toxic concentrations led to a decrease in cell proliferation, rapid cell differentiation, and mineralization failure. Calcium, whilst stimulating cell proliferation was not able to overcome the negative effects of high concentrations of lactic and glycolic acids on osteoblasts. These effects help to explain recently reported clinical failures of calcium phosphate/PLGA composites, but further in vitro analyses are needed to mimic the dynamic situation which occurs in the body by, for example, culture of osteoblasts with materials that have been pre-degraded to different extents and thus be able to relate these findings to the degradation studies that have been performed previously.

"Abstract: Significant public and scientific concerns remain for the use of nanoparticles (NPs) in commercial products, particularly those applied topically for skin care. There are currently a range of metal oxides formulated into many sunscreens that are present at the nanoscale. In this study, we sought to determine the effect of the size and dispersion of one type of these NPs (zinc oxide) on immune cell function and cytotoxicity for human macrophages and monocytes, which are key cells for particle and debris clearance in the skin. We have found that particle size and coating, but surprisingly, not agglomeration, are key determinates of nanoparticle cytotoxicity in an in vitro culture system of human immune cells. Most importantly, we found that this nanoparticle-induced cellular immune signalling, can be decoupled from cytotoxicity and surface coating, so that at an equivalent cytotoxic load, smaller particles induce a greater cellular response.

"BACKGROUND: There is a need for the development of novel non-steroidal topical drugs for the treatment of psoriasis. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of topical 1.0% WBI-1001 in patients with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis. METHODS: A total of 61 patients with 1-10% body surface area (BSA) covered with plaque psoriasis and a physician's global assessment score (PGA) of 2-4 were randomized (2:1) to receive either 1% WBI-1001 in a cream formulation or placebo, applied twice daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated using PGA, BSA and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). The primary endpoint was the change from baseline (Day 0) in PGA at week 12. RESULTS: The improvement in PGA at week 12 was 62.8% for patients randomized to WBI-1001 when compared with 13.0% for patients randomized to placebo (P<0.0001). At week 12, the proportion of patients who achieved a PGA of clear or almost clear and the mean improvement in BSA were 67.5% and 79.1%, respectively, for patients randomized to WBI-1001, when compared with 4.8% (P<0.0001) and an increase of 9.4% (P<0.0001), respectively, for patients randomized to placebo. More application site adverse drug reactions were observed in patients randomized to WBI-1001 than in those randomized to placebo. These adverse drug reactions were all mild or moderate in intensity. CONCLUSION: Topical WBI-1001 induces rapid and significant improvement in patients with plaque psoriasis. "
"INTRODUCTION: Melasma is a common pigmentary disorder caused by abnormal melanin deposits within the skin. Hydroquinone (HQ) is presently the most popular depigmenting agent, however the treatment of melasma remains unsatisfactory, resulting in a need to evaluate new depigmenting agents. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess, using standard methods and a novel technique, in vivo Reflectance Confocal Microscopy (RCM), the efficacy and safety of a new non-HQ bleaching agent Dermamelan® (Mesoestetic, Barcelona, Spain) in the treatment of melasma. METHODS: Ten women with melasma were enrolled in an open-label trial lasting four months. Patients were of Fitzpatrick skin types II-IV. A non-HQ depigmenting agent (Dermamelan) was applied once-daily for three months. Melasma Area and Severity Indices (MASI) were measured. Standard and UV-light photographs were taken and in vivo RCM, which detects pigmentary changes at a cellular level, was done. Evaluations were performed before treatment, on the first, second and third month of treatment and one month after treatment. Upon cessation of the trial, patients completed a questionnaire regarding efficacy and tolerance. RESULTS: At baseline, RCM detected hyperpigmented keratinocytes in all patients, dendritic cells in 2/10 patients, and melanophages in 2/10 patients. Based on the MASI score, Dermamelan treatment improved melasma by 50 percent. This was confirmed by standard and UV-light photography. Maximum therapeutic effect was usually reached by one month of treatment and was maintained at one month following its completion. Interestingly Dermamelan treatment also induced a statistically significant decrease of pigmented epidermal keratinocytes as detected by RCM. Patients with melanophages on RCM at baseline had a poorer outcome, but not those with dendritic cells. Mild irritation was the only adverse event observed during treatment. The majority of patients were satisfied with the result. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that Dermamelan produces significant rapid improvement of melasma at a clinical and cellular level and demonstrates the potential of RCM to monitor and possibly predict efficacy of a new depigmenting agent in the treatment of melasma.

"Abstract: Organic sunscreens may decrease their protective capability and also behave as photo-oxidants upon ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure. The present study investigated the effect of a cream gel formulation containing the UV filters benzophenone-3, octyl methoxycinnamate, and octyl salicylate on skin superoxide dismutase (SOD) after a single dose of UVR (2.87 J/cm(2)). The retention of these UV filters was first evaluated in vivo using hairless mice to guarantee the presence of the filters in the skin layers at the moment of irradiation. The in vivo effect of the UV filters on skin SOD was then assayed spectrophotometrically via the reduction of cytochrome c. The cream gel formulation promoted the penetration of the three UV filters into the epidermis and the dermis at one hour post-application. A significant decrease in SOD activity was observed in irradiated animals treated with sunscreen formulation. However, no effect on SOD activity in skin was observed by the isolated presence of the sunscreens, the formulation components, or the exposure to UVR. The sunscreens may have formed degradation products under UVR that may have either inhibited the enzyme or generated reactive species in the skin. "
"BACKGROUND: Ichthyoses are genetic disorders of keratinization which are uncomfortable due to their conspicuous scaling, itching and cosmetic problems. Ichthyoses can lead to social discrimination and psychological problems. Ichthyosis vulgaris (IV) is the most common form of these geno-dermatoses. IV is a chronic disorder that often requires continuous therapy. Emollient and keratolytic products are the mainstay treatments of IV. It is important that efficient, safe and well tolerated therapies should be available. Direct comparative data regarding efficacy of different emollient products in IV patients are very few. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the keratolytic and moisturizing properties as well as the tolerance of a new urea topical formulation (Ureadin Rx10) when applied to hyperkeratotic and dry skin in patients with (IV) in comparison with a standard emollient cream. METHODS: The study was conducted as a two-center, randomized, controlled, single-blind, intra-patient (right-vs.-left) trial design. A total of 30 patients with IV between 8 and 65 (mean age: 25 years) treated with a 10% urea-based lotion, Ureadin Rx 10 * *Ureadin RX 10 is a registered trade name of ISDIN, Spain. (URx), for 4 weeks or a glycerol-based emollient cream, Dexeryl † †Dexeryl is a registered trade name of Pierre Fabre Dermatologie. (DC), in a right-vs.-left study design. Primary outcome was a 5-point SRRC Index score (evaluating scaling roughness, redness and cracks) evaluated at baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. As secondary endpoints patients evaluated also the global efficacy (GE) and global tolerability (GT) scores with the help of a 10 cm visual analogue scale (0 = no efficacy at all/very bad tolerability; 10: excellent efficacy/excellent tolerability). RESULTS: At baseline the mean (SD) SRRC score was 9.5 (1.9) in the URx treated sites and 9.5 (1.9) in the DC treated sites. A total of 27 patients (90%) concluded the study period. Three patients were withdrawn prematurely because of itching and burning sensation after DC application (1 patient) or URx application (2 patients). At week 4, in comparison with baseline values, both treatments were shown to be clinically effective: SRRC significantly (p = 0.0001) decreased to 3.3 (1.8) after URx (a 65% relative reduction) and to 5.7 (2.5) after DC (a 40% relative reduction). SRRC was significantly lower in URx treated regions in comparison with DC both after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment (p = 0.0005). Mean GE score in areas treated with URx was significantly (p = 0.0001) higher than in the areas treated with the DC (8.9 vs.7.3). Both treatments were in general well tolerated. GT score was 8.1 (range 10 to 3) with URx and 8.4 (range 10 to 3) with DC application (p = ns). The two main limitations of this trial are the study design (single blind), and the small sample size which is not adequate for an evaluation of safety. CONCLUSION: Ureadin Rx 10 lotion has shown a greater efficacy on ichthyosis vulgaris in term of reduction of scaling, roughness, redness and cracking in comparison with a glycerol-based emollient cream. Tolerability of the two topical treatments was comparable. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed for the evaluation of safety and tolerability of urea 10% lotion in this clinical setting. "
"Abstract: The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that as much as 80% of the solar radiation that an adult receives throughout his/her life is received during the first 18 years (1). Skin protection against harmful solar radiation during this early stage of life is therefore a highly important factor in the prevention of future skin-related diseases. In this respect, recent developments in pediatric dermatology and cosmetic technology have led to remarkable improvements in child skin protection products. However, in spite of these scientific breakthroughs, many currently available commercial sunscreen formulations have not been well received by the general public, due to inadequate sensory properties, chemical instability, undesirable side effects, and low effectiveness. These disadvantages are not only attributable to the formulations themselves, active principle, and excipients, but also, to a large extent, galenic aspects. The objective of this work was to develop and characterize a sunscreen emulsion for pediatric use, using a towelette as vehicle, to overcome problems of ineffectiveness and formulation instability, and to improve skin-sensory properties. The composition of the towelette, the emulsion, and the presentation format were selected on the basis of the differences between children's and adult skin. In order to evaluate the chemical stability of the formulation, a study of the organoleptic, physicochemical, microbiological, and rheological characteristics was carried out at 4°, 25°, and 40°C over a period of 30 days. Tests were performed on both the sunscreen emulsion only and the same formulation impregnated within a towel, to test the influence the towel may have on the stability of the emulsion. "
"Abstract: Fluticasone propionate (FP), a medium potent glucocorticoid (class III) of carbothioate nature with a favourable benefit/risk ratio, has emerged as a standard medication for the topical treatment of inflammatory skin disorders, in particular atopic dermatitis (AD). FP is available as a 0.05% cream and a 0.005% ointment formulation. The glucocorticoid is characterized by high lipophilicity, high affinity binding to the glucocorticoid receptor and a rapid hepatic biotransformation. Though skin blanching following topical application of FP surpasses that given with glucocorticoids of medium strength, clinical trials show a low potential of FP for local and systemic adverse effects. Even in paediatric patients with AD as well as in difficult-to-treat areas like face, eyelids and intertriginous areas, FP proved to be both effective and safe. Thus, the therapeutic effects of FP clearly outweigh the unwanted effects. Correspondingly, a therapeutic index of 2.0 can be attributed to this glucocorticoid. In this respect, topical FP does not differ from other topical glucocorticoids with increased benefit-to-risk ratio, e.g. prednicarbate, methylprednisolone aceponate and mometasone furoate. However, randomized controlled trials do not only support conventional intervention but also innovative maintenance treatment. "
"BACKGROUND: Skin moisturizing is an important issue due to its impact on skin function. Adverse reactions to herbal extracts have been rarely reported and can be used in moisturizers. This study was conduct to evaluate moisturizing effect of a methanolic extract of five medicinal plants incorporated into cream bases. METHODS: Methanolic extract of five medicinal plants including olive, burdock, licorice, mallow and marsh horsetail was prepared. The extracts were dissolved in distilled water completely and freeze-dried to a dry powder. These extracts were added separately to the cream based formulation that has been suggested to be appropriate for adding herbal extracts. Moisturizing effects of these creams with herbal extracts were assessed using the impedance method on 12 rats equally divided into six groups (one control and five cases), as well as the extensiometry method on 25 mice divided into five groups (in each group one cream with herbal extract and control cream were tested concurrently). Obtained results were compared with the control cream based. RESULTS: The maximum moisturizing effect was observed with the marsh horsetail. Other creams with herbal extracts, except the one with the licorice, also exerted significantly higher moisturizing effect compared to the controls (P<0.05). Regarding the force for skin tearing, the differences were statistically significant in all groups when compared to the control group (P<0.05) and the highest difference was seen in the marsh horsetail group (2.0832 ± 0.6811 kgN). CONCLUSIONS: The highest moisturizing activity was observed using marsh horsetail extract that can be explained by flavonoids content of marsh horsetail. "
"Abstract: Calcipotriene (calcipotriol)/betamethasone dipropionate (calcipotriene 50 μg/g and betamethasone 0.5 mg/g) is a fixed-dose combination of a vitamin D3 analog and a corticosteroid indicated for the once-daily, topical treatment of psoriasis vulgaris of the trunk, limbs, and scalp in adults. Both the ointment (Daivobet®; Dovobet®) and gel (Xamiol®; Daivobet® Gel; Dovobet® Gel) formulations of calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate can be used to treat psoriasis vulgaris of the trunk and/or limbs, although the gel formulation was specifically developed for the treatment of scalp psoriasis. This article reviews the efficacy and tolerability of calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate in patients with psoriasis vulgaris, as well as summarizing its pharmacologic properties. Calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate has low systemic absorption and displays local anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties. It reduces the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and helps normalize keratinocyte differentiation. In large, well designed clinical trials, calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate, either as the ointment or the gel formulation, applied once daily for 4-8 weeks, was more effective than placebo, calcipotriene, or tacalcitol, as well as betamethasone dipropionate in most instances, for the topical, symptomatic treatment of psoriasis vulgaris of the trunk/limbs. Likewise, calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate gel applied once daily for 8 weeks was more effective than placebo or either component alone in the topical, symptomatic treatment of psoriasis vulgaris of the scalp. Long-term, once-daily, when required therapy with calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate for 52 weeks was more effective than calcipotriene alone for the treatment of scalp psoriasis, and was at least as effective as switching to calcipotriene for 48 weeks after 4 weeks of calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate or alternating between calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate and calcipotriene every 4 weeks for 52 weeks in the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris of the trunk/limbs. Calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate also improved health-related quality of life. Calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate was generally well tolerated, with most adverse drug reactions being lesional or perilesional effects of mild or moderate severity. Calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate was often associated with fewer lesional/perilesional adverse reactions than calcipotriene or tacalcitol and did not appear to be associated with a higher incidence of corticosteroid-related adverse events during long-term therapy. Pharmacoeconomic analyses predicted calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate to be more cost effective than other topical therapies. Thus, calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate is an important, effective, once-daily, topical therapy for the symptomatic treatment of psoriasis vulgaris of the trunk, limbs, and scalp. "
"AIM: Dry skin and pruritus are common complication of end-stage renal diseases (ESRD), affecting up to 80% of dialysis patients. They are chronic, unpleasant skin manifestations with a strong negative impact on patients' quality of life, often inducing sleeplessness and mood disorders. The pathogenesis of skin xerosis (SX) and uraemic pruritus (UP) are multifactorial. Moisturizing emollients are commonly used for the treatment of SX and UP. Urea is used in dermatology due to its excellent hydrating and moisturizing properties. Urea is useful in all cases of dry skin and, depending on the concentration levels, will act as moisturizing or keratolitic agent. Ureadin Rx 10 is a topical hydrating and emollient lotion formulation. So far no data are available regarding the efficacy of topical application of urea in lotion in the treatment of SX and UP in dialysed patients. In a prospective open pilot trial we assessed the effect of topical 10% Urea ISDIN® plus dexpanthenol lotion in the treatment of SX and UP in dialyzed patients. METHODS: A total of 15 hemodialyzed patients (3 men; 12 women, mean age 66 years) with SX and UP were enrolled after their informed consent in the trial. Topical 10% Urea ISDIN® plus dexpanthenol (Ureadin RX; ISDIN) lotion (URx) was applied twice daily over the arm and the legs for 28 consecutive days. Primary outcomes were a 5-point SRRC Index score (evaluating scaling roughness, redness and cracks) and a 4-point itching score (IS) both measured at baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: At baseline mean (SD) SRRC was 5 (2.3). After URx treatment SRRC significantly (P=0.0001) decreased to 1.6 (2.1) and to 0.9 (1.2) after two and four weeks respectively (a relative reduction of 82% at week 4). IS at baseline was 1.0 (1.4). URx reduced IS significantly (P=0.008) to 0.2 (0.5) at week 2 and to 0.06 at week 4 (a relative reduction of 94% at week 4). Local tolerability was excellent/good in 14 out of 15 patients. One patient reported mild burning sensation after application of the product. CONCLUSION: In this pilot trial topical application of 10% Urea ISDIN ® plus dexpanthenol lotion has shown to improve skin dryness and pruritus in haemodialysis patients. "
"Abstract: Azelaic acid (AzA) gel 15% is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of papulopustular rosacea (PPR). Its efficacy and safety as monotherapy have been demonstrated. Release of active drug from the gel formulation is superior to the cream. The combination of AzA gel 15% with oral doxycycline appears to expedite and augment response, especially in cases of PPR of greater severity, and AzA gel 15% maintains control of PPR over 6 months as compared to vehicle. Adjunctive skin care is recommended to augment the therapeutic outcome of PPR and reduce the potential for irritation that can occur with topical therapy. "
"BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) or its methylester [methyl-5-aminolaevulinate (MAL) or 5-amino-4-oxopentanoate] was recently ranked as first-line therapy for the treatment of actinic keratosis (AK) and is an accepted therapeutic option for the treatment of neoplastic skin diseases. BF-200 ALA (Biofrontera Bioscience GmbH, Leverkusen, Germany) is a gel formulation of ALA with nanoemulsion for the treatment of AK which overcomes previous problems of ALA instability and improves skin penetration. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of PDT of AKs with BF-200 ALA in comparison with a registered MAL cream and with placebo. METHODS: The study was performed as a randomized, multicentre, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, interindividual trial with BF-200 ALA, a registered MAL cream and placebo in a ratio of 3:3:1. Six hundred patients, each with four to eight mild to moderate AK lesions on the face and/or the bald scalp, were enrolled in 26 study centres in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Patients received one PDT. If residual lesions remained at 3months after treatment, PDT was repeated. RESULTS: PDT with BF-200 ALA was superior to placebo PDT with respect to patient complete clearance rate (78·2% vs. 17·1%; P<0·0001) and lesion complete clearance rate (90·4% vs. 37·1%) at 3months after the last PDT. Moreover, superiority was demonstrated over the MAL cream regarding the primary endpoint patient complete clearance (78·2% vs. 64·2%; P<0·05). Significant differences in the patient and lesion complete clearance rates and severity of treatment-related adverse events were observed for the narrow- and broad-spectrum light sources. CONCLUSIONS: BF-200 ALA is a very effective, well-tolerated new formulation for AK treatment with PDT and is superior to a registered MAL medication. Efficacies and adverse events vary greatly with the different light sources used. "
"Abstract: We studied the effects of density and thickness of PEG coating on in vitro cellular uptake, and dark- and photo-toxicity of liposomal formulations (Fospeg) of the photodynamic agent meta-tetrahydroxyphenyl chlorin (m-THPC). The cellular uptake of various Fospeg formulations was determined by flow cytometry in CCD-34Lu human normal fibroblasts and A549 lung cancer cells. Dark and light-induced cytotoxicity was measured by MTS assay after exposure to increasing concentrations of Fospeg only and followed by irradiation with red light. Intracellular localization of m-THPC delivered by Fospeg was determined by fluorescence microscopy. The studies were carried out in comparison with m-THPC delivered by the standard solvent. In the dark all Fospeg formulations were less cytotoxic than m-THPC in standard solvent (ethanol/poly(ethylene glycol 400/water; 20 : 30 : 50 by vol.) and cytotoxicity decreased by increasing PEGylation. m-THPC delivered as Fospeg was internalised by endocytosis and localised mainly in the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum. The efficiency of cellular uptake of Fospeg was reduced by 30-40% with respect to m-THPC in standard solution causing a slight reduction of the phototoxicity but without serious impairment of the efficacy of the treatment. Our study suggests that PEGylated liposomes are promising nanocarriers for the delivery of photosensitisers for photodynamic therapy because they reduce dark cytotoxicity while preserving therapeutic efficacy.

"Abstract: Flavonoids have many positive effects on various cell layers of the skin (e.g. anti-oxidant, anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory effects). However, the limiting factor of the use of flavonoids is their low water solubility. To overcome the poor solubility, apigenin nanosuspensions were prepared using the combination technology (CT), i.e. bead milling and subsequently high pressure homogenization. Distinct reduction in particle size was observed after each bead milling passage resulting in z-average (PCS) of 413 nm and a polydispersity index of 0.202. The LD data showed a similar pattern of particle size reduction reaching a diameter 99% (d(v)99%) of 0.515 μm. The antioxidant capacity of apigenin nanocrystals were almost doubled compared to the original coarse suspension. The developed smartCrystals can be easily incorporated into gels, which makes apigenin nanocrystals available for dermal application as efficient antioxidant. "
"Abstract: Topical capsaicin formulations are used for pain management. Safety and modest efficacy of low-concentration capsaicin formulations, which require repeated daily self-administration, are supported by meta-analyses of numerous studies. A high-concentration capsaicin 8% patch (Qutenza™) was recently approved in the EU and USA. A single 60-min application in patients with neuropathic pain produced effective pain relief for up to 12 weeks. Advantages of the high-concentration capsaicin patch include longer duration of effect, patient compliance, and low risk for systemic effects or drug-drug interactions. The mechanism of action of topical capsaicin has been ascribed to depletion of substance P. However, experimental and clinical studies show that depletion of substance P from nociceptors is only a correlate of capsaicin treatment and has little, if any, causative role in pain relief. Rather, topical capsaicin acts in the skin to attenuate cutaneous hypersensitivity and reduce pain by a process best described as 'defunctionalization' of nociceptor fibres. Defunctionalization is due to a number of effects that include temporary loss of membrane potential, inability to transport neurotrophic factors leading to altered phenotype, and reversible retraction of epidermal and dermal nerve fibre terminals. Peripheral neuropathic hypersensitivity is mediated by diverse mechanisms, including altered expression of the capsaicin receptor TRPV1 or other key ion channels in affected or intact adjacent peripheral nociceptive nerve fibres, aberrant re-innervation, and collateral sprouting, all of which are defunctionalized by topical capsaicin. Evidence suggests that the utility of topical capsaicin may extend beyond painful peripheral neuropathies. "
"OBJECTIVE: To determine in vitro the action of chlorhexidine digluconate and different commercially available mouthrinses on oral microorganisms. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Minimal inhibitory concentrations and possible induction of resistance by chlorhexidine digluconate, an essential oil-containing mouthwash and an amine fluoride/stannous fluoride solution, were determined against microorganisms normally found in the oral cavity (10 streptococci, 2 enterobacteria, 1 Candida albicans, 8 Porphyromonas gingivalis, 6 Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and 1 Fusobacterium nucleatum). Further, the effect of a 1-minute exposure on cell and bacterial viability was studied. RESULTS: The susceptibility of the oral microorganisms to chlorhexidine digluconate ranged from 0.01% to 0.50%. Passages on agar plates containing subinhibitory concentrations of chlorhexidine digluconate resulted in a transitory moderate increase in the tolerance to chlorhexidine digluconate in five of the 24 isolates. After 1 minute of exposure, chlorhexidine digluconate solutions as well as the essential oil and the amine/stannous fluoride-containing solutions showed a high activity against the tested microorganisms. Commercially available chlorhexidine digluconate formulations (ie, those with antidiscoloration systems) were partly less efficient than the corresponding manually prepared chlorhexidine digluconate preparation. The determination of MTT resulted in a strong cytotoxicity of all tested preparations to gingival fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that most of the chlorhexidine digluconate formulations as well as essential oil and the amine fluoride/stannous fluoride solutions are active against oral microbes. Long-term use of these agents would not result in emergent antimicrobial resistance. "
"Abstract: Recent advances in the field of nanotechnology have allowed the manufacturing of elaborated nanometer-sized particles for various biomedical applications. A broad spectrum of particles, extending from various lipid nanostructures such as liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles, to metal, nanocrystalline and polymer particles have already been tested as drug delivery systems in different animal models with remarkable results, promising an extensive commercialization in the coming years. Controlled drug release to skin and skin appendages, targeting of hair follicle-specific cell populations, transcutaneous vaccination and transdermal gene therapy are only a few of these new applications. Carrier systems of the new generation take advantage of improved skin penetration properties, depot effect with sustained drug release and of surface functionalization (e.g., the binding to specific ligands) allowing specific cellular and subcellular targeting. Drug delivery to skin by means of microparticles and nanocarriers could revolutionize the treatment of several skin disorders. However, the toxicological and environmental safety of micro- and nanoparticles has to be evaluated using specific toxicological studies prior to a wider implementation of the new technology. This review aims to give an overview of the most investigated applications of transcutaneously applied particle-based formulations in the fields of cosmetics and dermatology. "
"GOALS: To describe dermatologic side effects encountered during treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C, and analyze factors predisposing to such reactions. BACKGROUND: Treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with interferon (IFN) and ribavirin is associated with a number of mucocutaneous adverse reactions that have not been adequately studied. STUDY: A retrospective cohort study design was used to longitudinally describe mucocutaneous drug eruptions during IFN and ribavirin therapy in HCV-infected patients. Factors predictive of mucocutaneous eruptions were analyzed by the use of Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: A total of 286 HCV-infected consecutive patients were treated with one of the IFNα formulations plus ribavirin. The mean age was 51.1 years (SD 5.6). There were 6 female patients. There were 5 patients who were also infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Fifty-six percent of the patients were white, 37% were African American, and 14% were Hispanic. Twenty-one percent of all study patients developed mucocutaneous drug eruptions. The most common drug eruptions were eczematous drug eruptions (48%), seborrheic dermatitis (11%), and xerosis (8%). Dermatologic eruptions were a contributing factor in the decision to discontinue antiviral treatment in 10% of cases. Use of Pegylated IFN formulations (hazard ratio=1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-3.34) and presence of HIV coinfection (hazard ratio=4.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.61-12.92) were associated with increased rate of skin reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Mucocutaneous reactions during IFN and ribavirin treatment of hepatitis C are common and are associated with HIV infection and use of Pegylated IFN. "
"Abstract: To develop a novel ciclosporin A (CsA)-loaded nanosuspension causing less ocular irritation, a range of nanosuspensions was prepared with various polymers using a media milling method. The effects of polymer, milling time, milling speed and bead material on the particle size of the nanosuspension were investigated. Stability and irritation tests in rabbits' eyes were then performed comparing the nanosuspension with a commercial product. Of the nanosuspensions prepared with various polymers, that with PVA showed no creaming or sedimentation phenomena and gave the smallest particles of about 530 nm. The particle size decreased abruptly as the milling time increased to 2 h and then hardly decreased further. As the milling speed was increased, the particle size of CsA in the nanosuspension also increased. Nanosuspensions prepared with zirconia beads gave significantly finer particles than those with polystyrene beads. In particular, the CsA-loaded nanosuspension with a CsA/PVA/water weight ratio of 0.5/1/100 prepared using the top-down media milling method with zirconia beads of 300 microm diameter at 1000 rpm for 2 h gave a minimum particle size of about 530 nm. This nansuspension was physcally and chemically stable for at least two months. In the Draize test, both this nanosuspension and the commercial product gave very slight ocular irritation. However, in the Schirmer tear test, this nanosuspension caused less irritation to the rabbits' eyes compared to the commercial product. Thus, the CsA-loaded nanosuspension prepared with PVA and water using the top-down media milling method could be a promising candidate for causing less ocular irritation. "
"Abstract: Hydroxyzine HCl is used in oral formulations for the treatment of urticaria and atopic dermatitis. Dizziness, blurred vision, and anticholinergic responses, represent the most common side effects. It has been shown that controlled release of the drug from a delivery system to the skin could reduce the side effects while reducing percutaneous absorption. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to produce an effective drug-loaded dosage form that is able to control the release of hydroxyzine hydrochloride into the skin. The Microsponge Delivery System is a unique technology for the controlled release of topical agents, and it consists of porous polymeric microspheres, typically 10-50 μm in diameter, loaded with active agents. Eudragit RS-100 microsponges of the drug were prepared by the oil in an oil emulsion solvent diffusion method using acetone as dispersing solvent and liquid paraffin as the continuous medium. Magnesium stearate was added to the dispersed phase to prevent flocculation of Eudragit RS-100 microsponges. Pore inducers such as sucrose and pregelatinized starch were used to enhance the rate of drug release. Microsponges of nearly 98% encapsulation efficiency and 60-70% porosity were produced. The pharmacodynamic effect of the chosen preparation was tested on the shaved back of histamine-sensitized rabbits. Histopathological studies were driven for the detection of the healing of inflamed tissues. "
"Abstract: Carbaporphyrin ketals are porphyrinoid compounds in which a pyrrole ring of a typical porphyrin macrocycle has been replaced by a ketal-substituted indene ring. It was recently demonstrated that these compounds are effective in vitro against Leishmania tarentolae. Their in vitro effectiveness is increased when they are exposed to visible light; they act as photosensitizers capable of mediating the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Following on this evidence, the effectiveness and cytotoxicity of the dimethyl and diethyl carbaporphyrin ketals (CKOMe and CKOEt, respectively) were determined in vitro using pathogenic Leishmania species with and without exposure to visible light (2 and 4 h). The effectiveness against various pathogenic Leishmania species was determined to be in a micromolar range. Additionally, the effect of encapsulating the carbaporphyrin ketals in liposome formulations was tested. Liposomal delivery diminished their toxicity, while the effectiveness was enhanced upon exposure to visible light (photodynamic effect). The cytotoxicity levels for human U937 cells and hamster peritoneal macrophages were in the ranges of 0.3 to 9 μM and 7 to 330 μM, respectively. When tested in vivo, using a hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) model of cutaneous leishmaniasis, CKOMe was active even in the dark, suggesting that the compound, once metabolized in the animal tissue, produces an active ingredient that does not seem to be photosensitive. Reduction in lesion size, histopathologic analyses, and smears confirmed the in vivo effectiveness of the compound, since the parasitic load was diminished without noticeable toxic effects. "
"Abstract: This review discusses the pharmacology, analgesic efficacy, safety and tolerability of topical NSAIDs, salicylates and capsaicin for the management of osteoarthritis (OA) pain. Topical therapies present a valuable therapeutic option for OA pain management, with substantial evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of topical NSAIDs, but less robust support for capsaicin and salicylates. We define topical therapies as those intended to act locally, in contrast to transdermal therapies intended to act systemically. Oral therapies for patients with mild to moderate OA pain include paracetamol (acetaminophen) and NSAIDs. Paracetamol has only weak efficacy at therapeutic doses and is hepatotoxic at doses >3.25 g/day. NSAIDs have demonstrated efficacy in patients with OA, but are associated with dose-, duration- and age-dependent risks of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal, haematological and hepatic adverse events (AEs), as well as clinically meaningful drug interactions. To minimize AE risks, treatment guidelines for OA suggest minimizing NSAID exposure by prescribing the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time. Systemic NSAID exposure may also be limited by prescribing topical NSAIDs, particularly in patients with OA pain limited to a few superficial joints. Topical NSAIDs have been available in Europe for decades and were introduced to provide localized analgesia with minimal systemic NSAID exposure. Guidelines of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), Osteoarthritis Research Society International, and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) state that topical NSAIDs may be considered for patients with mild to moderate OA of the knee or hand, particularly in patients with few affected joints and/or a history of sensitivity to oral NSAIDs. In fact, the EULAR and NICE guidelines state that topical NSAIDs should be considered before oral therapies. Clinical trials of topical NSAIDs, most notably formulations of diclofenac and ketoprofen, have shown efficacy significantly superior to placebo and similar to oral NSAIDs. Most topical NSAIDs (piroxicam being the exception) have shown improved safety and tolerability compared with oral NSAIDs. Topical salicylates and capsaicin are available in the US without a prescription, but neither has shown substantial efficacy in clinical trials, and both have potential to cause serious AEs. Accidental poisonings have been reported with salicylates, and concerns exist that capsaicin-induced nerve desensitization is not fully reversible and that its autonomic nerve effects may increase the risk of skin ulcers in diabetic patients.

"Abstract: Advanced glycation Maillard reaction end products (AGEs) are causing the complications of diabetes and skin aging, primarily via adventitious and cross-linking of proteins. Long-lived proteins such as structural collagen are particularly implicated as pathogenic targets of AGE processes. The formation of α-dicarbonyl compounds represents an important step for cross-linking proteins in the glycation or Maillard reaction. The purpose of this study was to investigate the contribution of glycation coupled to the glycation free-radical oxidation reactions as markers of protein damage in the aging of skin tissue proteins and diabetes. To elucidate the mechanism for the cross-linking reaction, we studied the reaction between a three-carbon α-dicarbonyl compound, methylglyoxal, and amino acids using EPR spectroscopy, a spectrophotometric kinetic assay of superoxide anion production at the site of glycation and a chemiluminescence technique. The transglycating activity, inhibition of transition metal ions peroxidative catalysts, resistance to hydrolysis of carnosine mimetic peptide-based compounds with carnosinase and the protective effects of carnosine, carcinine and related compounds against the oxidative damage of proteins and lipid membranes were assessed in a number of biochemical and model systems. A 4-month randomized, double-blind, controlled study was undertaken including 42 subjects where the oral supplement of non-hydrolized carnosine (Can-C Plus® formulation) was tested against placebo for 3 months followed by a 1-month supplement-free period for both groups to assess lasting effects. Assessment of the age-related skin parameters and oral treatment efficacy measurements included objective skin surface evaluation with Visioscan® VC 98 and visual assessment of skin appearance parameters. The results together confirm that a direct one-electron transfer between a Schiff base methylglyoxal dialkylimine (or its protonated form) and methylglyoxal is responsible for the generation of the cross-linked radical cation and the radical counteranion of methylglyoxal. Under aerobic conditions, molecular oxygen can then accept an electron from the methylglyoxal anion to generate the superoxide radical anion causing the propagation of oxidative stress chain reactions in the presence of transition metal ions. Carnosine stabilized from enzymatic hydrolysis, carcinine and leucyl-histidylhydrazide in patented formulations thereof, demonstrate the Schiff bases' transglycating activities concomitant with glycation site specific antioxidant activities and protection of proprietary antioxidant enzymes in the skin during aging and with diabetes lesions. During oral supplementation with stabilized from enzymatic hydrolysis carnosine (Can-C Plus® formulation), the skin parameters investigated showed a continuous and significant improvement in the active group during the 3 months of supplementation as compared to placebo. Visual investigation showed improvement of the overall skin appearance and a reduction of fine lines. No treatment-related side effects were reported. The finding that already-formed AGE cross-links can be pharmacologically severed and attendant pathology thereby reversed by non-hydrolized carnosine or carcinine in patented oral formulations thereof has broad implications for the skin beautification and therapeutics of the complications of diabetes and skin diseases associated with aging.

"Abstract: In order to cross the skin barrier several techniques and carrier systems were developed to increase skin penetration of topical dermatics and to reduce systemic adverse effects by avoiding systemic application. Ultra-flexible vesicles, e.g. invasomes and core-multishell (CMS) nanotransporters are efficient drug delivery systems for dermatological applications. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic techniques were used for the determination of localization and distribution of the spin label 3-carboxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-pyrrolidinyloxy (PCA; logP=-1.7) within the carrier systems and the ability of the carriers to promote penetration of PCA into the skin. The results show an exclusive localization of PCA in the hydrophilic compartments of the invasome dispersion and the CMS nanotransporter solution. PCA penetration was enhanced 2.5 fold for CMS and 1.9 fold for invasomes compared to PCA solution. Investigation of penetration depth by step-wise removal of the stratum corneum by tape stripping revealed deepest PCA penetration for invasomes. UV-irradiation of PCA-exposed skin samples revealed that the spin label is still reactive. In conclusion novel polymer-based CMS nanotransporters and invasomes can favor the penetration of PCA or hydrophilic drugs. This offers possibilities for e.g. improved photodynamic therapy. "
"Abstract: Previous studies demonstrated that proteinases from latex of C. candamarcensis act as mitogens on fibroblast and epithelial cells and a subsequent report showed their protective, angiogenic and wound healing effects on gastric ulcers. In this study, we present evidence of skin healing activity by the group of proteinases known as P1G10. By using a hairless mouse model, we compared the healing effect following topical application of various concentrations of P1G10. The data confirm that healing actions take place between 0.1 and 1%, without adverse local irritation or systemic toxicological action after a prolonged period of use. The wound healing effect is unaltered when P1G10 is previously inhibited with iodoacetamide. The low permeation of the hydrosoluble formulation Polawax(®) supports the maintenance of the drug at the site of application. These results extend the healing properties of these groups of enzymes in situations of dermatological trauma and open the way to future clinical applications. "
"Abstract: Psoriasis is a common dermatological disease affecting up to 1-2% of the world's population. It is associated with both organic and psychosocial complications like psoriatic arthropathy, nephritis, infection, hyperuricemia, hypoproteinemia, depression, and stress, and is responsible for hindering patients' daily activities. The present study was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of two pharmacopeial Unani formulations (Majoon Ushba and Roghane Hindi) in the management of psoriasis on scientific parameters. Thirty diagnosed psoriasis patients, satisfying the inclusion criteria, were selected for a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study in the Department of Moalajat (Medicine), National Institute of Unani Medicine, Bangalore. The patients were divided by the method of Random Table Numbers into test and control groups after obtaining informed consent. The experimental group comprised 20 patients to whom Majoon Ushba 5 g was administered orally twice daily and Roghane Hindi was applied locally twice daily. The control group comprised 10 patients who were given placebo drugs orally and topically. The duration of the trial was 8 weeks and follow-up was done fortnightly. The severity of psoriasis and efficacy of the drug was assessed by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Scale. The results of both groups were compared and analyzed statistically. The study showed significant reduction in the PASI score in the test group (P < 0.01) as compared to placebo. No obnoxious side effects were observed in the test group: toxicological parameters were within normal limits even after 2 months of treatment. It was therefore concluded that Majoon Ushba and Roghane Hindi are safe and effective in the management of psoriasis. "
"BACKGROUND: Oxybutynin chloride topical gel (OTG; Gelnique®) is an approved formulation for the transdermal administration of oxybutynin, an established antimuscarinic therapy for overactive bladder (OAB). Transdermal administration of oxybutynin minimizes plasma concentrations of the active metabolite N-desethyloxybutynin (N-DEO), which can have anticholinergic adverse effects. OBJECTIVES: In four phase I studies, we separately assessed the effects of OTG application site selection on oxybutynin bioavailability (site-to-site study); the effects of post-application showering on oxybutynin steady-state pharmacokinetics (showering study); the effects of sunscreen application on oxybutynin absorption (sunscreen study); and the person-to-person transfer of oxybutynin through skin-to-skin contact at the application site (transference study). METHODS: All four studies were open-label, randomized, phase I studies. The site-to-site and showering studies involved repeated administration of OTG to establish steady-state plasma concentrations of oxybutynin and N-DEO; the other two studies involved single doses. Clinical visits were required for pharmacokinetic sampling, supervision of OTG self-application on pharmacokinetic sampling days, showering, sunscreen application and transference experiments. The study included healthy subjects aged 18-45 years. Subjects with conditions requiring medical therapy or interfering with the application of OTG or the interpretation of pharmacokinetic results were excluded. Participants applied OTG (1 g containing oxybutynin chloride 10%, 1.14 mL/dose) once daily to the abdomen, upper arm/shoulder or thigh. Showering occurred 1-6 hours after dosing. Sunscreen was applied 30 minutes before or after OTG application. Abdomen-to-abdomen contact with movement for 15 minutes between treated and untreated participants was conducted 1 hour after dosing. Time points of serial blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analyses varied among studies. Plasma concentrations of oxybutynin and N-DEO (except transference study) were measured. Bioequivalence was tested with ANOVA models for log(e)-transformed plasma exposure (area under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC]) and maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) to generate 90% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Oxybutynin and N-DEO exposures (AUCs) from time zero to 24 hours (AUC(24)) were similar for the three application sites, with N-DEO/oxybutynin mean AUC(24) ratios of approximately 0.9. The 90% CIs for thigh-to-abdomen ratios of oxybutynin AUC(24) (0.93, 1.23) and C(max) (0.85, 1.16) were within the interval required for bioequivalence (0.8, 1.25); the other application site ratios for oxybutynin had boundaries slightly outside this interval. Showering 1-6 hours and sunscreen application 30 minutes before or after OTG application had minor effects on oxybutynin concentrations. After vigorous skin contact between treated and untreated participants at the application site, the mean ± SD AUC from time zero to 48 hours (AUC(48)) of oxybutynin in 12 untreated participants was 29.8 ± 24.5 ng · h/mL, approximately one-quarter of the exposures generally seen in subjects treated with a single dose of OTG. Oxybutynin AUC(48) after clothing-to-skin contact was undetectable in 12 of 14 untreated participants and very low (mean ± SD 0.4 ± 0.8 ng · h/mL) in two untreated female participants. CONCLUSION: The bioavailability of oxybutynin and its pharmacokinetic profile are not greatly affected by application site selection, post-application showering or sunscreen use shortly before or after dosing with OTG. Oxybutynin transference to untreated persons is essentially prevented by avoiding direct skin-to-skin contact with the application site. "
"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: India has a population with high degree of medical pluralism. Siddha system of Indian traditional medicine is practiced dominantly by the people in Tamil Nadu. The traditionally trained Siddha healers still play an important role in the rural health care. Their knowledge is comparatively more vulnerable than the documented traditional knowledge. Thus, the present study was aimed to document and quantitatively analyze the local knowledge of the traditional Siddha healers in Virudhunagar district of Tamil Nadu, India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The results presented in this paper are the outcome of series of interviews conducted between January and August, 2010 consisting of 196 field days. After getting prior informed consent, interviews were conducted and successive free-listing was used in the interviews in order to make informants cite the medicinal plants that they have used. By this way 96 healers were interviewed and their data were quantitatively analyzed using various indices such as Informant Consensus Factor (F(ic)), Fidelity Level (FL), Informant Agreement on Remedies (IAR) and Cultural Importance Index (CII). RESULTS: This study recorded the ethno-medicinal usage of 227 species which were used to prepare 611 formulations for the treatment of 36 illness categories. The knowledge holders had the experience of minimum 20 years. There was unevenness in male-female ratio. Regarding the medicinal plants, easily available plants were holding significantly high number of citations, IAR and CII values. Nine illness categories had a high F(ic) value, compared to others. Species with high citations in these groups were Moringa oleifera (aphrodisiacs), Acalypha indica (dermatological ailments), Dodonaea viscosa (musculo-skeletal disorders), Solanum trilobatum (pulmonary ailments), Phyllanthus amarus (jaundice), Piper nigrum (adjuvant) Allium cepa (hemorrhoids), Azadirachta indica (antiseptic) and Tribulus terrestris (urinary ailments). CONCLUSION: Quantitative analysis of the data had revealed that the easily available species hold a high consensus and cultural importance. Future biomedical studies using the medicinal plants enumerated in this study, particularly those with high number of citations and high F(ic) values might yield some novel prototypes. Such studies will also be useful to assess the efficacy and safety of these herbal treatments to take decisions on the health care of rural India. "
"Abstract: The safety of loratadine (second-generation antihistamine) and montelukast (leukotriene receptor antagonist) as monotherapies is well documented. Safety of the fixed-dose, single-tablet therapy loratadine/montelukast (L/M; SCH 445761, containing loratadine [10 mg]/montelukast [10 mg]), for treatment of the symptoms of allergic rhinitis in >3800 subjects is described. Safety data from 19 randomized clinical studies in which subjects were administered L/M are presented. Adverse events (AEs) were defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or laboratory data, including onset of new illness and exacerbation of preexisting conditions. Only AEs with an onset during the treatment period (i.e., treatment emergent) are summarized. Safety was also assessed via clinical laboratory evaluations and monitoring of vital signs and electrocardiogram (ECG). Overall, the incidence of AEs reported with L/M in the 19 studies was low and comparable with placebo, loratadine monotherapy, and montelukast monotherapy. The most frequently reported AE across all studies was headache. Most AEs were not severe and the duration of such events was short lived. Three AEs (headache [4.5%], fatigue [1.2%], and pharyngolaryngeal pain [1.2%]), regardless of relation to treatment, were reported by >1% of subjects in the L/M treatment group of multiple-dose, placebo-controlled studies. There were no clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory analyses or in vital signs, physical findings, or ECG found to be clinically relevant. Administration of the fixed-dose, single-tablet formulation of L/M was well tolerated. In these clinical studies, the safety of L/M was comparable with placebo, loratadine, and montelukast. "
"Abstract: Cyclosporine (CsA) as an immunosuppressant has demonstrated immense potential in the field of organ transplantation and autoimmune disorders, despite the nephrotoxicity. The present investigation is an attempt to develop biodegradable nanoparticles entrapping CsA that can match Cmax of Neora, the most potent formulation available to date. The Cmax and AUC0-72 of CsA administered as nanoparticles demonstrated an increase with increase in the dose administered, however the relative bioavailability decreased. The Cmax and AUC0-72 increased from 682 to 1073 ng/ml and 34854 to 55322 ng . h/ml, respectively whereas, the relative bioavailability decreased from 120 to 64%. On the other hand, the increase in initial CsA loading (10-30% w/w of polymer) recorded a proportional increase in Cmax and AUC0-72, from 494 to 1101 ng/ml and 17774 to 51763 ng . h/ml, respectively. The relative bioavailability also increased from 31 to 89%. The CsA nanoparticles at 30% CsA loading w/w of polymer and at 30 mg/Kg single dose demonstrated comparable Cmax of Neoral at 15 mg/Kg, which upon chronic administration over a period of 30 days daily dosing showed low nephrotoxicity to that exhibited by Neoral. The reduced toxicity of nanoparticulate CsA indicated by lower blood urea nitrogen, plasma creatinine and glomerular damage, was due to delay in Tmax as result of slow release of the CsA from the nanoparticles. The investigation unlocks the potential of polymeric nanoparticles in oral delivery of CsA. "
"BACKGROUND: Normally, percutaneous absorption tests are carried out using skin biopsies for an apparent and acceptable physiological condition. However, under different pathological conditions, the stratum corneum (SC) barrier function is impaired. METHODS: The barrier function of the SC was assessed by correlation between the number of repeated applications of tape strips on the skin and its transepidermal water loss (TEWL), as well as by in vitro percutaneous absorption studies of different compounds, using Franz diffusion cells and porcine skin previously stripped. RESULTS: A progressive diminution of the skin barrier function has been detected by TEWL both in vitro and in vivo as the number of skin tape strips increases. On the other hand, the percutaneous absorption of the compounds tested increases in a different way as the number of strips increases. Salicylic acid increases linearly depending on the barrier disturbance. However, percutaneous absorption of caffeine exponentially increased with barrier disturbance. Our results indicate that the barrier impairment of skin always increases the penetration behavior of a given compound; however, the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance of the compounds or formulations used could greatly modify its penetration profile, especially when a modified skin is used. CONCLUSIONS: This in vitro protocol may be useful to simulate the percutaneous absorption profile of some drugs applied onto skin with an impaired SC barrier function and could be used to avoid, to some extent, the use of in vivo experimental animal models in the dermopharmaceutical field.

"Abstract: Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles have wide-ranging applications in a diverse array of industrial and consumer products, from ceramic manufacture and paint formulation to sunscreens and haircare products. Hence, it is imperative to rigorously characterize the health and safety aspects of human exposure to ZnO nanoparticles. This study therefore evaluated the cellular association, cytotoxic and inflammatory potential of spherical and sheet-shaped ZnO nanoparticles (of approximately the same specific surface area ≈30 cm²/g) on mouse and human cell lines (RAW-264.7 and BEAS-2B respectively), as well as with primary cultures of mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC). The WST-8 assay demonstrated dose-dependent effects on the cytotoxicity of spherical and sheet-shaped ZnO nanoparticles on both RAW-264.7 and BEAS-2B cells, even though there was no significant effect of shape on the cytotoxicity of ZnO nanoparticles. There was however higher cellular association of spherical versus sheet-shaped ZnO nanoparticles. Measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with the 2',7'-dichlorfluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay indicated up to 4-folds increase in ROS level upon exposure to ZnO nanoparticles, but there was again no significant difference between both ZnO nanoparticle shapes. Exposure of primary dendritic cells to ZnO nanoparticles upregulated expression of CD80 and CD86 (well-known markers of DC activation and maturation) and stimulated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines--IL-6 and TNF-α, thus pointing to the potential of ZnO nanoparticles in inducing inflammation. Hence, our study indicated that ZnO nanoparticles can have potential detrimental effects on cells even at dosages where there are little or no observable cytotoxic effects. "
"BACKGROUND: Actinic (solar) lentigines are melanotic tumors frequently developed during photoaging on the dorsum of the hands. Bleaching (whitening) agents are commonly offered to fade their darker aspect. In general, regular colorimetric methods show poor sensitivity to disclose any bleaching effect. METHOD: The present randomized controlled study on 24 women was designed to objectively assess the clinical efficacy of a combination of bleaching agents on actinic lentigines. In the endeavor of improving sensitivity, the ultraviolet light-enhanced visualization (ULEV) method was used to derive analytical measurements of lentigo areas and darkness. The test product was a commercially available formulation associating glycolic acid, kojic acid, lipohydroxyacid, and a Vitreoscilla extract. The Analysis® Olympus and Adobe Photoshop® quantitative methods were applied to the ULEV pictures. RESULTS: Data indicated a rapid bleaching effect arising as early as after 1 month of daily applications. The effect progressively increased over 3 months of therapy. CONCLUSION: The presently described analytical method appears to be sensitive to document some bleaching effects on actinic lentigines. "
"Abstract: Sunscreens containing titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NP) are effective barriers against ultraviolet B (UVB) damage to skin, although little is known about their disposition in UVB-damaged skin. Pigs were exposed to UVB that resulted in moderate sunburn. For in vitro studies, skin in flow-through diffusion cells were treated 24 h with four sunscreen formulations as follows: 10% coated TiO(2) in oil/water (o/w), 10% coated TiO(2) in water/oil (w/o), 5% coated ZnO in o/w, and 5% uncoated ZnO in o/w. TiO(2) (rutile, crystallite) primary particle size was 10 × 50 nm with mean agglomerates of 200 nm (range ca. 90 nm--460 nm); mean for ZnO was 140 nm (range ca. 60--200 nm). Skin was processed for light microscopy, scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). UVB-exposed skin had typical sunburn histology. TEM showed TiO(2) NP 17 layers into stratum corneum (SC), whereas ZnO remained on the surface. TOF-SIMS showed TiO(2) and ZnO epidermal penetration in both treatments. Perfusate analyzed by TEM/energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry detected no Ti or Zn, indicating minimal transdermal absorption. In vivo, skin was dosed at 24 h occluded with formulations and at 48 h. TiO(2) NP in o/w formulation penetrated 13 layers into UVB-damaged SC, whereas only 7 layers in normal skin; TiO(2) in w/o penetrated deeper in UVB-damaged SC. Coated and uncoated Zn NP in o/w were localized to the upper one to two SC layers in all skin. By SEM, NP were localized as agglomerates in formulation on the skin surface and base of hair. TOF-SIMS showed Ti within epidermis and superficial dermis, whereas Zn was limited to SC and upper epidermis in both treatments. In summary, UVB-damaged skin slightly enhanced TiO(2) NP or ZnO NP penetration in sunscreen formulations but no transdermal absorption was detected. "
"Abstract: Tretinoin is widely used in the treatment of acne. Despite significant advances in formulation development, irritation and dryness can be particularly bothersome, especially during the first 3-4 weeks, impacting adherence. Dose titration and adjunct use of moisturizers have been commonly employed. Co-prescribing with benzoyl peroxide (BPO) or a BPO/antibiotic combination is also common practice. The tretinoin molecule is unstable and can be degraded by BPO, further complicating treatment regimens. Lately, formulation technology has focused on providing more efficient penetration of the tretinoin into the skin layers so that lower concentrations of tretinoin might afford better tolerability, but maintain good efficacy; incorporating moisturizing excipients to minimize irritation; and providing greater stability to the tretinoin molecule. This approach would be particularly relevant in a pediatric acne population where efficacy/tolerability balance is important and treatment regimens must take into account lifestyles, but little data exist on the use of tretinoin in this patient population. A micronized formulation of tretinoin (0.05%) gel has been developed that provides a more efficient delivery of tretinoin, because of its optimal particle size, no degradation by BPO and better cutaneous tolerability than tretinoin microsphere (0.1%) gel without compromising efficacy in a pediatric population.

"Abstract: Many topical medications are available for the treatment of papulopustular rosacea. While treatments contain metronidazole, azelaic acid, or sodium sulfacetamide-sulfur as the active ingredient, the composition of the vehicle formulations varies widely. These vehicles come in gels, creams, lotions and foams; some ingredients are common to many vehicles, while some vehicles contain unique ingredients designed to optimize skin penetration and delivery of the active drug to its target. Vehicles can also influence tolerability, which is always a concern in patients with heightened skin sensitivity, and compliance, which is typically lower for topical treatments than oral treatments. Ideally, the vehicle of any rosacea treatment should enhance drug delivery, be nonirritating and be easy to use. Ingredients that help repair barrier function are also desirable. This review will focus on the key components of the vehicles from the most commonly used topical therapies for papulopustular rosacea and how vehicle formulations influence the delivery of active ingredient, skin barrier repair, tolerability and compliance.

"Abstract: The FDA has approved a topical 8% patch formulation of capsaicin (Qutenza-NeurogesX), available only by prescription, for local treatment of postherpetic neuralgia. Postherpetic neuralgia occurs after herpes zoster in about one third of patients ≥60 years old and can persist for months or even years. "
"Abstract: The VBM (vinblastine, bleomycin, methotrexate) chemotherapy combined with involved-field radiotherapy in early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma has not become popular in spite of its excellent results. Nine small trials with this combined therapy were carried out and described in eleven reports. VBM+ radiotherapy offered complete remission rates of 94-100%, with 5-year progression-free survival of 75-95% (elderly patients included). Considerable pulmonary toxicity was recorded in the first trials, but was fully controlled in the later studies through slight modifications of the schedule. The pulmonary toxicity was found related to mediastinal radiotherapy, bleomycin dose and administration of chemotherapy after radiotherapy; it is mitigated by low doses of prednisone. The very good results, the abated side effects on the lungs, the low extrapulmonary toxicity, and the anthracycline-free formulation make this combination therapy worth considering for early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly in the case of mediastinal involvement or in elderly patients. "
"BACKGROUND: Topical use of systemic agents to treat cutaneous disorders is widely applied. However, there is a lack of articles summarizing the relevant literature in a systematic way. OBJECTIVE: We sought to review the published literature regarding topical use of systemic drugs that were categorized according to their mode of actions. Only drugs that are not yet commercially available in a topical preparation are included. METHODS: A PubMed search was performed, using as key words ""topical,"" ""extemporaneous,"" ""compounding,"" and names of each generic drug, to identify all clinical reports (1966-2009). RESULTS: Although many systemic drugs are used topically, randomized controlled trials were limited to a few agents. LIMITATION: Many of the reports consist only of small case series or are anecdotal in nature. As the level of evidence is limited, larger prospective trials are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn. CONCLUSION: Extemporaneous compounding helps physicians to individualize treatment to the patient's specific needs and to create topical preparations that are not otherwise commercially available. However, comparative effectiveness studies are needed to determine whether or not topical use of systemic therapeutics is more beneficial than existing therapies. "
"Abstract: To compare the efficacy, tolerability and safety of a generic formulation of ciclosporin for human beings with prednisone in the treatment of canine atopic dermatitis), human generic ciclosporin A (hgCsA) (5 mg/kg daily) and prednisone (1 mg/kg daily for seven days, followed by 1 mg/kg every second day) were administered to 13 and seven dogs with atopic dermatitis, respectively, for 42 days. Skin changes were assessed using a modified canine atopic dermatitis extent and severity index (mCADESI-01) and a pruritus intensity scale system. The in vitro functional capacity of phagocytic cells was assessed using the tetrazolium reductase activity and zymosan-stimulated tetrazolium reductase activity tests, as well as measurements of the percentage phagocytic activity and the ingestion capacity of phagocytic cells. Haematological and biochemical parameters were also monitored. There was a greater than or equal to 50 per cent reduction from the baseline in mCADESI-01 scores in 84.6 and 100 per cent of dogs, and a greater than or equal to 50 per cent reduction from the baseline in pruritus scores in 76.9 and 85.7 per cent of dogs, treated with hgCsA and prednisone, respectively. No important adverse physical, haematological or biochemical effects occurred with either drug and no statistically significant changes were detected in any of the four tests assessing the functional activity of phagocytes. The generic formulation of ciclosporin was effective in reducing the severity of physical signs of canine atopic dermatitis and was well tolerated. "
"Abstract: The study evaluated the potential of nanoemulsions for the topical delivery of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and methyl ALA (mALA). The drugs were incorporated in oil-in-water (O/W) and water-in-oil (W/O) formulations obtained by using soybean oil or squalene as the oil phase. The droplet size, zeta potential, and environmental polarity of the nanocarriers were assessed as physicochemical properties. The O/W and W/O emulsions showed diameters of 216-256 and 18-125 nm, which, respectively, were within the range of submicron- and nano-sized dispersions. In vitro diffusion experiments using Franz-type cells and porcine skin were performed. Nude mice were used, and skin fluorescence derived from protoporphyrin IX was documented by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The loading of ALA or mALA into the emulsions resulted in slower release across cellulose membranes. The release rate and skin flux of topical drug application were adjusted by changing the type of nanocarrier, the soybean oil O/W systems showing the highest skin permeation. This formulation increased ALA flux via porcine skin to 180 nmol/cm(2)/h, which was 2.6-fold that of the aqueous control. The CLSM results showed that soybean oil systems promoted mALA permeation to deeper layers of the skin from ∼100 μm to ∼140 μm, which would be beneficial for treating subepidermal and subcutaneous lesions. Drug permeation from W/O systems did not surpass that from the aqueous solution. An in vivo dermal irritation test indicated that the emulsions were safe for topical administration of ALA and mALA.

"Abstract: The aim of the present study was to comparatively evaluate DNA damage and cellular death in cells exposed to various commercially available mouthrinses: Listerine Cepacol, Plax alcohol free, Periogard, and Plax Whitening. A total of 75 volunteers were included in the search distributed into five groups containing 15 people each for in vivo study. Exfoliated buccal mucosa cells were collected immediately before mouthrinse exposure and after 2 weeks. Furthermore, blood samples were obtained from three healthy donors for in vitro study. The micronucleus test was used to evaluate mutagenicity and cytotoxicity in vivo. The single-cell gel (comet) assay was used to determine DNA damage in vitro. After 2 weeks exposure, Periogard showed 1.8% of micronucleated cells with significant statistical differences (p < 0.05) compared to before exposure (0.27%). Plax Whitening presented high tail moment value (4.5) when compared to negative control (0.6). The addition of all mouthrinses to cells incubated with methyl methanesulfonate did not alter the number of strand breaks in the genetic material. Listerine was able to reduce genetic damage induced by hydrogen peroxide because a decrease of tail moment was noticed. The results of the present study suggest that Periogard and Plax Whitening can induce genetic damage, whereas Listerine is an antioxidant agent. Since DNA damage is considered to be prime mechanism during chemical carcinogenesis, these data may be relevant in risk assessment for protecting human health and preventing carcinogenesis. "
"Abstract: Children with high-risk neuroblastoma are treated with polychemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy and even autologous stem-cell transplantation. On top of this complex treatment, most children also receive 13-cis retinoic acid as differentiation agent. As no suitable pharmaceutical formulation is available so far, there are often problems with the administration of the product in children. The present report describes some practical recommendations for the administration of isotretinoin in children treated for high-risk neuroblastoma. "
"Abstract: A new sunscreen ingredient, methoxycinnamidopropyl polysilsesquioxane (MCP-PSQ), which contains an UV-absorbing p-methoxycinnamoyl group, has been developed synthetically and evaluated using in vitro and in vivo approaches. Previous studies revealed that MCP-PSQ has a raising or boosting effect on the sun protection factor (SPF) of other sunscreen agents. In this study, we demonstrated that MCP-PSQ, an organic/inorganic hybrid compound, has photoprotective effects for human fibroblasts, and for hairless mouse and human skin. MCP-PSQ increases cell viability and suppresses the expression of p53 protein in fibroblasts after UV exposure. In addition, the numbers of sunburn cells and mast cells are reduced by topical application of MCP-PSQ on hairless mouse skin after UV irradiation. A 10% MCP-PSQ cream has higher and similar effects on SPF values for human skin compared to 5% titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) and 5% ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC), respectively. The SPF value obtained using the MCP-PSQ cream did not drop after UV irradiation of the cream itself. However, higher dose of UV irradiation is required to guarantee the stability or photostability of the formulation. Further, there were no side effects such as erythema, edema, itch or tingling, suggesting that MCP-PSQ is a good sunscreen agent. "
"BACKGROUND: Antioxidants are now being incorporated into sunscreens as additional topical measure for delaying the aging process and reducing photo-damage to skin induced by excessive UVA exposure. UVA radiation reaching the skin leads to the generation of ROS (reactive oxygen species) implicated in DNA damage and activation of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) responsible for collagen damage and photo-aging. Nitroxides are a class of compounds endowed with versatile antioxidant activity and recently, nitroxide-based UV filters in which a nitroxide moiety has been attached to the most popular UV filter present in sunscreens have been developed. OBJECTIVE: This study explores the potential photo-protective effects of these compounds on ROS production and induction of MMP-1 in cultured human dermal fibroblasts exposed to UVA. For comparison, vitamin E was also tested. METHODS: The effects were assessed by measuring intracellular ROS production using a ROS-index probe and MMP-1 mRNA expression levels using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). RESULTS: Exposure of fibroblasts to 18J/cm(2) UVA lead to a two-fold increase in ROS production which was reduced to non-irradiated control levels in the presence of 50μM nitroxide compounds and vitamin E. Under the same conditions, a ten-fold increase in MMP-1 mRNA expression levels was observed 24h post-UVA treatment which was significantly reduced by all nitroxide compounds but not vitamin E. CONCLUSION: The results of this study support the potential use of nitroxide compounds, including novel nitroxide-based UV filters, as a useful and alternative strategy for improving the efficacy of topical formulations against photo-aging and possibly photo-carcinogenesis.

"Abstract: Calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (calcipotriol 50 μg/g and betamethasone 0.5 mg/g) is a fixed-dose combination of a vitamin D(3) analogue and a corticosteroid indicated for the once-daily, topical treatment of psoriasis vulgaris of the trunk, limbs and scalp in adults. Both the ointment (Daivobet®; Dovobet®) and gel (Xamiol®; Daivobet® Gel; Dovobet® Gel) formulations of calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate can be used to treat psoriasis vulgaris of the trunk and/or limbs, although the gel formulation was specifically developed for the treatment of scalp psoriasis. This article reviews the efficacy and tolerability of calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate in patients with psoriasis vulgaris, as well as summarizing its pharmacological properties. Calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate has low systemic absorption and displays local anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties. It reduces the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and helps normalize keratinocyte differentiation. In large, well designed clinical trials, calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate, either as the ointment or the gel formulation, applied once daily for 4-8 weeks, was more effective than placebo, calcipotriol and tacalcitol, as well as betamethasone dipropionate in most instances, for the topical, symptomatic treatment of psoriasis vulgaris of the trunk/limbs. Likewise, calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate gel applied once daily for 8 weeks was more effective than placebo or either component alone in the topical, symptomatic treatment of psoriasis vulgaris of the scalp. Long-term, once-daily, when required therapy with calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate for 52 weeks was more effective than calcipotriol alone for the treatment of scalp psoriasis, and was at least as effective as switching to calcipotriol for 48 weeks after 4 weeks of calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate or alternating between calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate and calcipotriol every 4 weeks for 52 weeks in the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris of the trunk/limbs. Calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate also improved health-related quality of life. Calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate was generally well tolerated, with most adverse drug reactions being lesional or perilesional effects of mild or moderate severity. Calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate was often associated with fewer lesional/perilesional adverse reactions than calcipotriol or tacalcitol and did not appear to be associated with a higher incidence of corticosteroid-related adverse events during long-term therapy. Pharmacoeconomic analyses predicted calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate to be more cost effective than other topical therapies. Thus, calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate is an important, effective, once-daily, topical therapy for the symptomatic treatment of psoriasis vulgaris of the trunk, limbs and scalp. "
"Abstract: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, recurring, pruritic, inflammatory skin condition which has its onset in early childhood in most cases. A stepped approach to therapy, starting with emollients and adding first mild and then more potent topical medications is recommended. For more than 50 years, topical corticosteroids (TCs) have been the gold standard in AD therapy. Increasingly potent TCs have tended to come with increasing risk of adverse events, however. Calculating the benefit/risk ratio [or therapeutic index (TIX)] for TCs when treating children and infants is more challenging in this population. Not only does their increased surface area to volume ratio as a result of their small size mean that they are likely to absorb a greater proportion of any active agent applied to their skin, but drug metabolism is slower than in adults and the systemic effects of corticosteroids are more pronounced (in particular reduction of serum cortisol levels through suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis). Unlike traditional TCs, topical calcineurin inhibitors are not associated with the systemic effects and have shown good efficacy in treating AD in children. Parental/Carer concerns about their long-term use can limit their acceptance for treatment in the paediatric population, however. Modifications to the structure of fourth generation corticosteroids mean that increased potency is not accompanied by increased risk of adverse events and hence they have an improved TIX. Methylprednisolone aceponate is a potent fourth generation corticosteroid which has demonstrated efficacy and safety in acute and maintenance programmes in infants and children. It is licenced for once-daily use, and is available in four formulations - ointment, fatty ointment, cream and milk, which combine with its improved TIX to meet the needs of young patients and their carers.

"Abstract: The present investigation was aimed at developing and exploring the potential of lactoferrin (Lf)-conjugated dendritic nanocomposite for lung targeting of methotrexate (MTX). The 5.0 G poly(propylene imine) (PPI) dendrimer and Lf-conjugated 5.0 G PPI dendrimer were synthesized and characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and transmission electron microscopy. The entrapment efficiency, in vitro release, and hemolytic toxicity were assessed. Pharmacokinetic and organ distribution studies were carried out to evaluate in vivo targeting potential of developed system. The pharmacokinetic studies showed that elimination half-life of MTX-loaded plain PPI dendrimer (10.41 ± 2.12 h, p < 0.05) and MTX-loaded Lf-conjugated PPI dendrimer (12.23 ± 1.53 h, p < 0.01) was significantly higher than the free drug (5.85 ± 1.19 h). Organ distribution assessment of different formulations displayed significant (p <0.05) higher accumulation of drug in lungs by MTX-Lf-PPI (1329 ± 26.7 ng/g of tissue) as compared with MTX-PPI (721 ± 23.4 ng/g of tissue) and free MTX (575 ± 19.7 ng/g of tissue) after 6 h of administration. The result suggested that Lf-conjugated 5.0 G PPI dendrimer-based formulations to be approximately 1.5 times and 2.5 times superior to plain 5.0 G PPI dendrimer as well as pure MTX, respectively, for lung targeting of anticancer drugs.

"Abstract: The present study investigated the potential use of topical formulations containing marigold extract (ME) (Calendula officinalis extract) against ultraviolet (UV)B irradiation-induced skin damage. The physical and functional stabilities, as well as the skin penetration capacity, of the different topical formulations developed were evaluated. In addition, the in vivo capacity to prevent/treat the UVB irradiation-induced skin damage, in hairless mice, of the formulation with better skin penetration capacity was investigated. All of the formulations were physically and functionally stable. The gel formulation [Formulation 3 (F3)] was the most effective for the topical delivery of ME, which was detected as 0.21 μg/cm(2) of narcissin and as 0.07 μg/cm(2) of the rutin in the viable epidermis. This formulation was able to maintain glutathione reduced levels close to those of nonirradiated animals, but did not affect the gelatinase-9 and myeloperoxidase activities increased by exposure to UVB irradiation. In addition, F3 reduced the histological skin changes induced by UVB irradiation that appear as modifications of collagen fibrils. Therefore, the photoprotective effect in hairless mice achieved with the topical application of ME in gel formulation is most likely associated with a possible improvement in the collagen synthesis in the subepidermal connective tissue.

"Abstract: Metal oxide nanoparticles such as TiO2 (< 100 nm) are used in lotions and sunscreens. Toxicity studies so far have reported the use of TiO2 NPs with size > 100 nm as determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique. We used non-reactive chemical agents such as propylene glycol (PG), glycerol (G), ethylene glycol (EG) to prevent aggregation and maintain NPs in monodispersed state closer to the reported TEM size. The lowest concentration of PG (0.1%) along with complete culture media (RPMI 1640) showed mean hydrodynamic diameter of TiO2 NPs as 33.71 nm measured by DLS. The present study demonstrates a method to prepare stable TiO2 NPs in culture media for toxicity assessment. This is a significant contribution as the biological properties of NPs vary considerably with decrease in size. "
"BACKGROUND: The novel hybrid retinoid, retinyl retinoate, is a synthetic material that was designed to reduce the side effects of retinoic acid and to increase the stability of retinol. The formulation of the retinyl retinoate, however, is required to enhance skin permeation, and thus to increase the anti-wrinkle effect. AIM: To identify the efficacy of retinyl retinoate microsphere using biodegradable polymer as an anti-aging agent of cosmetics in treating females over 30 years old with periorbital wrinkles. METHODS: The retinyl retinoate microsphere was prepared using the biodegradable polymer; polylactic acid (PLA). We also conducted two clinical studies with a total of 44 Korean women for 12 weeks. In the first clinical study, 20 patients completed a 12-week trial of cream A [3% PLA-retinyl retinoate (2%) microsphere] applied twice daily to the face. In the second clinical study, 24 patients completed a 12-week trial of cream B (0.06% retinyl retinoate) applied twice daily to the face. Efficacy was based on a global photodamage score, photographs, and image analysis using replicas and Visiometers every 4 weeks. RESULTS: The PLA-retinyl retinoate microsphere was more effective for the permeation of retinyl retinoate than retinyl retinoate in itself. The cream A, which contains 3% PLA-retinyl retinoate (2%) microsphere, showed a statistically significant improvement in facial wrinkles (P<0.05) in 20 volunteers after only 4 weeks of application in a clinical trial test. The visual wrinkle improvement and the maximum roughness improvement rate (R2) for cream A was 6.05%, 8.03% higher than that of cream B which contains 0.06% retinyl retinoate, after 4 weeks. CONCLUSION: Retinyl retinoate has a potent anti-wrinkle activity, and the PLA-retinyl retinoate microsphere could be a useful cosmeceutical product for anti-aging purposes. "
"BACKGROUND: Aqueous Cream BP is frequently prescribed for patients with eczema and is known to induce sensitivity in certain patients and also to decrease the thickness of the stratum corneum (SC). We have previously reported methodology to quantify corneocyte maturity and size, protease activity and protein content within different levels of the SC. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in corneocyte size, corneocyte maturity, selected protease activities, protein content and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) in normal skin after a 28-day application of Aqueous Cream BP. METHODS: The left and right mid volar forearms of six healthy female volunteers were selected as the study sites. Aqueous Cream BP was applied twice daily to treated sites for 28 days. At the end of this period, the site was tape-stripped and corneocyte maturity, corneocyte size and protease activity of the desquamatory kallikrein proteases, KLK5 and KLK7, and the inflammatory proteases tryptase and plasmin were measured. Protein content and TEWL measurements were also recorded. RESULTS: Corneocyte maturity and size decreased with increasing number of tape strips, and were significantly lower in treated sites compared with untreated sites. Protease activity and TEWL values were higher (P < 0·05) for the treated sites compared with untreated sites. The amount of protein removed from deeper layers of treated sites was significantly lower than from untreated sites. CONCLUSIONS: We report rapid minimally invasive measures of the effects of Aqueous Cream BP at the cellular and molecular level of the skin. Treatment with this formulation is associated with increased desquamatory and inflammatory protease activity. Changes in corneocyte maturity and size are also indicative of accelerated skin turnover induced by chronic application of this emollient. These findings question firmly the routine prescription of this preparation as a moisturizer in patients with atopic dermatitis. "
"BACKGROUND: In 2007, the Danish Cancer Society and the Tryg Fonden launched a campaign to prevent skin cancer and melanoma. As a part of this intervention programme, the Danish Cancer Society prepared a ''sun policy'', which recommends how children in Danish kindergartens can be protected from the sun. AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the factors that influence a decision to implement the sun policy in Danish kindergartens. METHODS: We conducted a comparative qualitative study. Data were collected at semi-structured interviews with the principals of five kindergartens with a sun policy and five without. RESULTS: The key factor in making a decision is the priority given to the sun policy by the principal, which in turn depends on the principal's perception of his or her resources. Further factors are the principal's attitude toward parental responsibility and media focus on sun protection. CONCLUSIONS: Principals must be convinced of the importance of a written sun policy. A mailed reminder containing arguments about its importance to accompany the draft sun policy might reinforce the formulation and implementation of sun policies nationwide. "
"Abstract: Acne vulgaris continues to be a challenge to dermatologists and primary care physicians alike. The available treatments reflect the complex and multifactorial contributors to acne pathogenesis, with topical retinoids as first-line therapy for mild acne, topical retinoids in combination with anti-microbials for moderate acne, and isotretinoin for severe nodular acne. Unfortunately, these conventional therapies may not be effective against refractory acne, can lead to antibiotic resistance, and is associated with adverse effects. With the rise of new technologies and in-office procedures, light and laser therapy, photodynamic therapy, chemical peels, and comedo extraction are growing in popularity as adjunctive treatments and may offer alternatives to those who desire better efficacy, quicker onset of action, improved safety profile, reduced risk of antibiotic resistance, and non-systemic administration. Whereas adjunctive therapies are generally well-tolerated, the number of randomized controlled trials are few and limited by small sample sizes. Furthermore, results demonstrating efficacy of certain light therapies are mixed and studies involving photodynamic therapy and chemical peels have yet to standardize and optimize application, formulation, and exposure times. Nevertheless, adjunctive therapies, particularly blue light and photodynamic therapy, show promise as these treatments also target factors of acne pathogenesis and may potentially complement current conventional therapy.

"PURPOSE: The production and administration of drugs used intrathecally requires special care to prevent contamination with neurotoxic agents. In 2007, we investigated a widespread outbreak of paraplegia and paraparesis among Chinese patients who received intrathecal drugs to identify the presumed contaminant and its source to prevent further cases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We defined a case as onset from January 1 to October 31, 2007, of bilateral flaccid paraparesis or paraplegia or retention and incontinence of stool or urine, in a patient receiving intrathecal drugs. Using a retrospective cohort approach, we selected 12 hospitals from all hospitals that had reported cases. In these hospitals, we identified all 448 patients (including 107 cases) who received intrathecal chemotherapy or chemoprophylaxis in 2007. We calculated attack rates and Mantel-Haenszel adjusted risk ratios for intrathecal drug type and lot. RESULTS: All 12 hospitals used intrathecal methotrexate or cytarabine produced by one pharmaceutical plant. Only two lots of each drug were associated with cases. Lot-specific attack rates ranged from 42% to 100% (risk ratio, ∞; lower confidence bounds, 1.8 to 7.3). Vincristine production had immediately preceded production of the implicated lots on the same equipment. By using ultra performance liquid chromatography, we detected vincristine (0.28 to 18 μg) in unused vials from implicated lots of methotrexate and cytarabine. CONCLUSION: Trace amounts of vincristine that contaminated intrathecal drugs caused a large outbreak of severe neurologic damage. Vincristine and other neurotoxic drugs should not be produced on any equipment that is also used for producing drugs that are to be administered intrathecally. "
"Abstract: Formulation development is key to the successful treatment of acne. There has been significant progress over the past few years, but not all developments can be universally applied. An effective topical formulation must provide chemical stability and enhanced penetration of active ingredients at optimal concentrations for efficacy and safety; be cosmetically acceptable; and not add side effects of its own. Both retinoids and fixed combinations containing benzoyl peroxide are commonly used to treat acne, but both have the potential to cause troublesome dose-dependent irritation and dryness. Excipients such as surfactants and alcohol have added to the problem. Two products have recently been introduced where a combination of micronization skills and well-chosen excipients has minimized irritation and dryness without compromising efficacy. Results from two major studies are discussed in this article. "
"BACKGROUND: There is a high level of heterogeneity regarding the practical use of conventional systemic treatment in psoriasis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop evidence-based recommendations for the use of traditional systemic treatments in psoriasis in daily clinical practice: methotrexate (MTX), cyclosporin and retinoids. METHODS: A scientific committee selected clinically relevant questions concerning the use of MTX, cyclosporin and retinoids in psoriasis. This selection was made using the Delphi method. A systematic literature search was performed in Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library. The articles selected for analysis were reviewed and the level of evidence was appraised according to the Oxford Levels of Evidence. An Expert consensus meeting took place in June 2010, including 66 dermatologists. Recommendations for daily use of psoriasis systemic treatments were made during interactive workshops where the evidence was reviewed. Agreement among participants and the impact of the recommendations on clinical practice were systematically assessed using voting procedure in a plenary session. RESULTS: A total of 2800 references were identified, among which 122 articles were included in the systematic reviews. Three key recommendations on the use of MTX in psoriasis were formulated, including optimal dosage and route, use of folic acid, risk factors for liver fibrosis and monitoring of hepatotoxicity. The recommendations for cyclosporin in psoriasis focused on the modalities of cyclosporin prescription: dosage, scheme of treatment, optimal duration of treatment, renal toxicity monitoring and evidence for use of cyclosporin in non-plaque psoriasis (erythrodermic, pustular and ungueal). Recommendations were also made concerning the efficacy and safety of retinoids (mainly acitretin) in plaque and non-plaque psoriasis. CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations for the use of traditional systemic therapies in psoriasis are evidence based and supported by a panel of dermatologists. The next step will be to disseminate these recommendations and assess the agreement of physicians who were not involved in generating the recommendations. "
"Abstract: Nickel is an important economic commodity, but it can cause skin sensitization and may cause lung diseases such as lung fibrosis, pneumonitis, bronchial asthma and lung cancer. With development of nanotechnology, nano-sized nickel (Nano-Ni) and nano-sized titanium dioxide (Nano-TiO₂) particles have been developed and produced for many years with new formulations and surface properties to meet novel demands. Our previous studies have shown that Nano-Ni instilled into rat lungs caused a greater inflammatory response as compared with standard-sized nickel (5 μm) at equivalent mass concentrations. Nano-Ni caused a persistent high level of inflammation in lungs even at low doses. Recently, several studies have shown that nanoparticles can translocate from the lungs to the circulatory system. To evaluate the potential systemic effects of metal nanoparticles, we compared the effects of Nano-Ni and Nano-TiO₂ on matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP-2 and MMP-9) gene expression and activity. Our results showed that exposure of human monocyte U937 to Nano-Ni caused dose- and time- dependent increase in MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA expression and pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 activity, but Nano-TiO₂ did not. Nano-Ni also caused dose- and time- related increase in tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1), but Nano-TiO₂ did not. To determine the potential mechanisms involved, we measured the expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) in U937 cells exposed to Nano-Ni and Nano-TiO₂. Our results showed that exposure to Nano-Ni caused HIF-1α accumulation in the nucleus. Furthermore, pre-treatment of U937 cells with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor, 17-(Allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), prior to exposure to Nano-Ni significantly abolished Nano-Ni-induced MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA upregulation and increased pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 activity. Our results suggest that HIF-1α accumulation may be involved in the increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 production in U937 cells exposed to Nano-Ni. "
"Abstract: There are few topical formulations used for oral medicine applications most of which have been developed for the management of dermatological conditions. As such, numerous obstacles are faced when utilizing these preparations in the oral cavity, namely enzymatic degradation, taste, limited surface area, poor tissue penetration and accidental swallowing. In this review, we discuss common mucosal diseases such as oral cancer, mucositis, vesiculo-erosive conditions, infections, neuropathic pain and salivary dysfunction, which could benefit from topical delivery systems designed specifically for the oral mucosa, which are capable of sustained release. Each condition requires distinct penetration and drug retention profiles in order to optimize treatment and minimize side effects. Local drug delivery may provide a more targeted and efficient drug-delivery option than systemic delivery for diseases of the oral mucosa. We identify those mucosal diseases currently being treated, the challenges that must be overcome and the potential of novel therapies. Novel biological therapies such as macromolecular biological drugs, peptides and gene therapy may be of value in the treatment of many chronic oral conditions and thus in oral medicine if their delivery can be optimized. "
"Abstract: Scalp psoriasis is a common life-altering skin condition causing a great deal of distress. It significantly affects quality of life and is difficult to manage. Treatment can provide variable results, often impacting patient compliance with therapy. Salicylic acid is used as adjunctive therapy to other topical treatments because of its marked keratolytic effect. Its effectiveness as a monotherapy is not fully understood. An emollient foam formulation of 6% salicylic acid (Salkera) in an ammonium lactate vehicle has recently become available. Efficacy, tolerability and patient acceptability of salicylic acid 6% emollient foam were assessed in an open-label pilot study of 10 subjects with scalp psoriasis. All psoriasis severity parameters were reduced with a significant decrease in Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) score from 15.3 to 3.0 after four weeks of monotherapy (P<0.001). Sixty percent of subjects were either ""completely cleared"" or ""almost cleared"" of their psoriasis. No adverse events (AEs) were reported. All signs and symptom tolerability measures demonstrated statistically significant score decreases with the exception of oiliness severity and patient-reported burning tolerability. Salicylic acid 6% emollient foam provides a useful option in the treatment of psoriasis that is highly effective, well tolerated and acceptable to patients. "
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Capsaicin selectively binds to TRPV1, the vanilloid subtype 1 of the superfamily of transient receptor potential ion channels, which is highly expressed in pain-transmitting C fibers. Recent reports have demonstrated that the coadministration of capsaicin with a local anesthetic (LA) at the rat sciatic nerve elicits a prolonged nociceptive-selective nerve block, suggesting that activation of the TRPV1 receptor may allow LAs to enter the nerve through the TRPV1 pore. In previous studies, we demonstrated that transdermal amitriptyline achieves clinical analgesic effects and is more potent than lidocaine. Here we examine whether the combined application of amitriptyline and capsaicin as a transdermal patch will produce prolonged cutaneous analgesia compared with amitriptyline alone. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (weights 250-300 g) were assigned to five treatment groups (n = 6-8 per group). Transdermal patches containing amitriptyline with different concentrations of capsaicin were applied for 3 hrs to rats' shaved backs: 2.5% amitriptyline alone (control group) and in combination with 0.05%, 0.15%, 1%, and 8% capsaicin. Behavioral testing for cutaneous nociception was conducted before drug application and after patch removal using the cutaneous trunci muscle reflex. In addition, skin appearance was assessed to determine irritation by these formulations. RESULTS: The cutaneous analgesic effect is significantly prolonged when amitriptyline is applied in combination with 8% capsaicin. Amitriptyline alone provided a complete block to pinprick for 4.5 hrs, and the time to full recovery was 96 hrs. Amitriptyline with 8% capsaicin produced a complete block to pinprick for 6 to 9 hrs, and the time to full recovery was 216 hrs (P = 0.002). Amitriptyline alone causes toxic effects in skin, whereas the higher the concentration of capsaicin, the less skin irritation was noted, and the combination of amitriptyline 2.5% with capsaicin 8% caused no adverse skin reactions. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the combined application of amitriptyline and capsaicin results in prolonged cutaneous analgesia compared with amitriptyline alone, suggesting that the activation of the TRPV1 channel by capsaicin facilitates the passage of amitriptyline into nociceptors. This transdermal patch achieves far longer cutaneous analgesia than currently available patch applications such as EMLA cream. The mechanism that underlies the lesser skin irritation noted when amitriptyline is combined with higher doses of capsaicin compared with amitriptyline alone is unclear and may be related to a counteraction of amitriptyline-induced vasoconstriction.

"Abstract: Titanium dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles are being increasingly formulated in sunscreens. While the same compounds, in larger particle form, work by reflecting UV radiation, in nanoparticle form, they absorb UV radiation, resulting in photocatalysis, releasing reactive oxygen species. These reactive oxygen species are known to have the capability to alter DNA. Previous studies suggest that this photocatalytic process may not be significant, because the nanoparticles do not penetrate below the level of the stratum corneum. However, some recent studies suggest that nanoparticles may, under certain circumstances, breach that barrier. The majority of those studies have used animal skin models rather than human skin. "
"Abstract: Novel drug delivery systems, such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), have been proposed to reduce retinoic acid (RA)-induced skin irritation. However, one question still remains: could it be accomplished without reducing efficacy? To evaluate this question the comedolytic effects and epidermal thickening of RA-loaded SLN were compared to the conventional RA formulations (gel or cream), as well as the potential of these formulations to induce skin irritation. The comedolytic effects and epidermal thickening of these formulations, both containing RA at 0.01 or 0.05%, were investigated in a rhino mouse model, while the studies of RA-induced skin irritation were evaluated through rabbit skin irritation tests and in the rhino mouse model. RA-loaded SLN, as compared to the placebo, produced a comedolytic effect with a significant reduction of the utricle diameter, which proved to be similar to that observed for marketed gels or creams regardless of the RA concentration. RA formulations (SLN or marketed cream) also induced an epidermal proliferation leading to a thickened epidermis in treated animals. In both animals studied (rhino mice and rabbits), the RA-loaded SLN, when compared to conventional formulations, promoted a significant reduction in RA-induced skin irritation (erythema and scaling). Then, RA-loaded SLN represents an interesting alternative to reduce RA-induced skin irritation without reducing efficacy, and constitutes an innovative approach for the topical treatment of acne with RA.

"Abstract: The multiple etiologic factors involved in acne vulgaris make the use of several medications necessary to treat the condition. Use of a fixed combination of clindamycin phosphate 1.2% and tretinoin 0.025% in conjunction with a benzoyl peroxide (BPO) wash 4% targets several pathologic factors simultaneously and mitigates the potential for clindamycin-induced Propionibacterium acnes-resistant strains. New formulations may allow such regimens to be effectively used without overly reduced tolerability resulting from the irritation potential of tretinoin and BPO. This randomized, single-blind study investigated the local tolerability, irritation potential, and safety of an aqueous-based gel (clindamycin phosphate 7.2%-tretinoin 0.025% [CT gel]) when used in conjunction with a BPO wash 4% in participants with mild to moderate acne vulgaris. Participants applied the CT gel once daily in the evening for 4 weeks in conjunction with once-daily morning use of either BPO wash 4% or nonmedicated soap-free cleanser lotion (SFC). Local tolerability and irritation potential were assessed by participants and investigators using separate 6-point scales. The frequency and severity of dryness, scaling, erythema, burning/stinging, and itching increased during the first week of treatment in both treatment arms but decreased thereafter. Local tolerability reactions were slightly more frequent in the CT gel + BPO wash group versus the CT gel + SFC group at week 1 but were generally mild and improved within 1 to 2 weeks. In conclusion, therapy with CT gel + BPO wash appears safe and well-tolerated in participants with mild to moderate acne vulgaris. "
"Abstract: Dry eye syndrome is a common disorder of the tear film caused by decreased tear production or increased evaporation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential effectiveness of Cyclosporine A (CsA) nanoparticles (NPs) for the treatment of inflammation of the eye surface. Topical CsA is currently the only and safe pharmacologic treatment of severe dry eye symptoms. The NPs were prepared using either poly-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) or a mixture of PLGA with Eudragit®RL or were coated with Carbopol®. The mean size of CsA loaded NPs was within the range from 148 to 219nm, except for the Carbopol® coated NPs (393nm). The drug entrapment efficiency was very high (from 83 to 95%) and production yield was found between 75 and 92% in all preparations. The zeta potential of the Eudragit® RL containing NPs was positive (19-25mV). The NPs formulations exhibited a biphasic drug release with initial burst followed by a very slow drug release and total cumulative release within 24h ranged from 75 to 90%. Kinetically, the release profiles of CsA from NPs appeared to fit best with the Weibull model. The viability of L929 cells was decreased by increasing the concentration of the various NPs examined as well as the incubation time. The amount of NPs uptake was related to the polymer type used. The highest degree of cellular uptake (52.2%), tear film concentration of the drug (366.3ng/g) and AUC(0→24) (972.6ngh/g) value were obtained from PLGA: Eudragit® RL (75:25)-CsA NPs formulations. The change of surface characteristics of NPs represents a useful approach for improvement of ocular retention and drug availability. "
"Abstract: Rosacea is a prevalent inflammatory skin disorder that affects approximately 16 million individuals in the United States. Although its exact etiology is unknown, basic science, histologic evidence, and clinical evidence suggest that it is inflammatory in nature. In this 12-week, open-label, multicenter, community-based, phase 4 trial, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of once daily subantimicrobial-dose doxycycline 40 mg (30-mg immediate-release and 10-mg delayed-release beads) in participants with papulopustular rosacea (PPR) who were receiving topical therapy (metronidazole, azelaic acid, and/ or sodium sulfacetamide-sulfur) at the time of the study entry but whose rosacea symptoms were still present. The primary outcome measure was the change in the investigator global assessment (IGA) score from baseline to end of study (week 12). Secondary outcome measures were changes from baseline to end of study in the clinician erythema assessment (CEA) score, treatment responders (IGA score of clear, near clear), and safety. After week 12, 75.7% of participants in the per-protocol (PP) population had IGA scores of clear or near clear. In addition, there were significant differences in the distribution of baseline and week 12 IGA scores in the PP group (P = .0012). At week 12, most participants (63.6%) had mild CEA scores; the distribution was significantly different from baseline (P = .0407). Only 7% of participants had treatment-related adverse events (AEs), mostly mild or moderate in severity. Thus the 40-mg formulation of doxycycline proved to be effective and well-tolerated in a real-world setting in participants with rosacea who were receiving topical therapy but still experiencing symptoms.

"Abstract: Topical ocular drug delivery has always been a challenge for pharmaceutical technology scientists. In the last two decades, many nano-systems have been studied to find ways to overcome the typical problems of topical ocular therapy, such as difficult corneal penetration and poor drug availability. In this study, methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-hexylsubstituted poly(lactides) (MPEG-hexPLA) micelle formulations, which are promising nanocarriers for poorly water soluble drugs, were investigated for the delivery of Cyclosporin A (CsA) to the eye. As a new possible pharmaceutical excipient, the ocular compatibility of MPEG-hexPLA micelle formulations was evaluated. An in vitro biocompatibility assessment on human corneal epithelial cells was carried out using different tests. Cytotoxicity was studied by using the [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] (MTT), and clonogenic tests and revealed that the CsA formulations and copolymer solutions were not toxic. After incubation with MPEG-hexPLA micelle formulations, the activation of caspase-dependent and -independent apoptosis as well as autophagy was evaluated using immunohistochemistry by analyzing the localization of four antibodies: (1) anti-caspase 3; (2) anti-apoptotic inducing factor (AIF); (3) anti-IL-Dnase II and (4) anti-microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3). No apoptosis was induced when the cells were treated with the micelle solutions that were either unloaded or loaded with CsA. The ocular tolerance was assessed in vivo on rabbit eyes by Confocal Laser Scanning Ophthalmoscopy (CLSO), and very good tolerability was seen. The observed corneal surface was comparable to a control surface that was treated with a 0.9% NaCl solution. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that MPEG-hexPLA micelles are promising drug carriers for ocular diseases involving the activation of cytokines, such as dry eye syndrome and autoimmune uveitis, or for the prevention of corneal graft rejection.

"Abstract: One of the current goals in photodynamic therapy research is to enhance the selective targeting of tumor cells in order to minimize the risk and the extension of unwanted side-effects caused by normal cell damage. Special attention is given to receptor mediated delivery systems, in particular, to those targeted to folate receptor. Incorporation of a model photosensitizer (ZnTPP) into a folate-targeted liposomal formulation has been shown to lead an uptake by HeLa cells (folate receptor positive cells) 2-fold higher than the non-targeted formulation. As a result, the photocytotoxicity induced by folate-targeted liposomes was improved. This selectivity was completely inhibited with an excess of folic acid present in the cell culture media. Moreover, A549 cells (folate receptor deficient cells) have not shown variations in the liposomal incorporation. Nevertheless, the differences observed were slighter than expected. Both folate-targeted and non-targeted liposomes localize in acidic lysosomes, which confirms that the non-specific adsorptive pathway is also involved. These results are consistent with the singlet oxygen kinetics measured in living cells treated with both liposomal formulations. "
"BACKGROUND: Modified release tacrolimus (TAC) is a new, once-daily oral formulation of the established immunosuppressive agent TAC. Simplification of regimen has been associated with better adherence. This study evaluated patient adherence, as well as safety and efficacy among chronic stable heart transplantation (HT) patients switched from a conventional twice daily calcineurin inhibitor-based regimen (TAC or cyclosporine A [CsA]) to (once daily) modified release TAC. METHODS: We switched 54 chronic stable patients (41 males and 13 females) from twice daily dosing with conventional TAC or CsA to once daily dosing with modified release TAC. Self-reported adherence was assessed at baseline and at 4 months after the switch using the Basel Assessment of Adherence with Immunosuppressive Medication Scale [BAASIS]), a 4-item validated questionnaire including also a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Nonadherence was defined as any self-reported nonadherence on any item. RESULTS: Modified release TAC was discontinued in 4 patients because of diarrhea (n = 1) or gastrointestinal discomfort (n = 3) leaving 50 evaluable patients. Overall nonadherence at baseline for any of the 4 items was 74% versus 38% after 4 months (P = .0001). Thereafter, adherence improved in 28 patients (56.0%), was unchanged in 18 (36.0%), and decreased in 4 subjects (8.0%). The VAS score improved from 82.3% ± 2.6% to 97.5% ± 4.8% (P < .0001). No significant changes were observed after 4 months regarding hematologic, renal, or liver function parameters (all P = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic regimens for transplant recipients are often complex, contributing to a high incidence of medication nonadherence. This study in chronic, stable, heart transplantation patients demonstrated a significant improvement in patient adherence after a switch to modified release TAC, which was generally well tolerated.

"BACKGROUND: Calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity remains an issue for recipients of solid organ transplants. After cyclosporine A (CsA) microemulsion administration, effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and glomerular filtration rate(GFR) are decreased coincident with the maximal concentration (Cmax) of CsA. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the once-daily formulation of tacrolimus extended release (Tac ER) includes an equivalent AUCPK 0-24 hr and a lower Cmax versus twice-daily Tac immediate release. METHODS: Eighteen healthy subjects were allocated once-daily Tac ER and twice-daily CsA in a prospective, randomized,open-label, two-period, two-sequence single crossover study. CsA was targeted to C2 of 700 to 1400 ng/mL, and Tac ER was targeted to C0 of 5 to 10 ng/mL. Pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments were conducted preexposure, and PD and PK were assessed during a 6-hr postdose period after 10-day exposure. RESULTS: The achieved mean C(o) Tac and CsA were 6.4 +/- 1.16 and 201 +/- 57 ng/mL, respectively. At Cmax, the change in ERPF was +30 +/- 127 vs. -70 +/- 96 mL/min/1.73 m2 relative to baseline for Tac ER and CsA (P=0.0085). The ERPF and GFR AUC (PD 0-6) hr were 3645 +/- 887 vs. 3210 +/- 582 mL/1.73 m2 (P=0.027) and 604 +/- 98 vs. 543+/- 79 mL/1.73 m2(P=0.023) for Tac ER versus CsA, respectively. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly greater with exposure to CsA compared with Tac ER. CONCLUSIONS: Acute reductions in ERPF and GFR are attenuated with Tac ER compared with CsA and may correlate with the differing PK profiles of these calcineurin inhibitors. "
"Abstract: Phthalocyanines are macrocyclic compounds that can be employed as photosensitizers in the treatment of various infections and diseases, as well as in photodynamic therapy. Nevertheless, a disadvantage for the clinical application of these compounds is their strong tendency to form oligomers (especially dimers), a phenomenon that reduces their efficiency as photosensitizers. In the present contribution, we have studied the photophysical and photochemical properties of ZnPc and ZnF(16)Pc in an organic solvent (THF) and liposomal formulations (DMPC, DPPC and DSPC). Our results show that dye incorporation into liposomes decreases its aggregation degree, as revealed by absorption spectra, triplet quantum yield, and singlet oxygen quantum yield measurements. Additionally, we studied the photodynamic activity of both phthalocyanines in liposomal formulation on human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells. For ZnF(16)Pc the photophysical behavior and phototoxicity in vitro correlate with the aggregation degree. The dimers are not photoactive and the photochemistry of ZnF(16)Pc depends of the fraction present as monomer. On the other hand, ZnPc aggregation is minimal and its photophysical and photochemical properties are similar in the three liposomes studied. Nevertheless, its phototoxicity in vitro is liposome dependent. "
"Abstract: Modern tissue culture technology has made it possible to generate human skin equivalents that represent either epidermis or epidermis plus dermis (full-thickness skin) in vitro. Commercially available skin equivalents and in-house models are used for safety analysis of cosmetics and toxicity screening of various pharmaceutical compounds. Recently, tissue culture technology has also been used to develop in vitro models of skin disease, in particular to promote cutaneous drug research while sparing experimental animals. The spectrum of model diseases available covers a range from inflammatory disease to cancer. It has, thus, been possible to gain more insight into the role of active pharmaceutical ingredients of various dermatologically relevant drug classes as well as conventional and innovative formulations.

"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the two-compound formulation (TCF) calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate (BDP) gel versus other topical therapies for scalp psoriasis in adults using direct and indirect comparisons. METHODS: A systematic review identified 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of topical treatments used in clinical practice for moderately severe scalp psoriasis. A meta-analysis was undertaken to obtain estimates of clinical effectiveness using recommended efficacy and safety outcome measures. We determined the proportion of responding patients using two definitions: i) 'controlled disease' using the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) rating scale and ii) a score of 0 or 1 on the Total Sign Score (TSS). Tolerability was extracted in terms of percentages of patients experiencing all adverse events (AEs), skin AEs and withdrawals due to AEs. Direct comparisons were performed where head-to-head data were available. For other comparators where TCF gel was compared indirectly, 'pairs' of trials were compared on the basis of a common comparator using meta-regression in order to derive an indirect comparison estimate, while preserving randomisation within trials. Assumptions of comparability were considered regarding study homogeneity (data can be pooled in a meta-analysis), similarity of trials (clinical and methodological) and consistency of findings from direct and indirect evidence. RESULTS: The meta-analysis showed that TCF gel was statistically significantly more effective than other topical treatments in terms of achieving a response defined according to both IGA and TSS criteria. TCF gel was generally associated with a statistically significant lower risk of AEs, skin AEs or patients withdrawing from RCTs due to AEs. CONCLUSIONS: Although direct and indirect evidence in this analysis is sparse, this indirect comparison suggests that the TCF gel has significant benefits over other topical therapies considered in the routine management of patients with moderately severe scalp psoriasis. Despite other analysis limitations in terms of study heterogeneity inevitable across an evidence base spanning decades, these results were consistent, using a number of efficacy and tolerability outcome measures. "
"OBJECTIVES: To compare the cost effectiveness of the two-compound formulation (TCF) calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate gel used first-, second- or third-line to standard topical treatments for moderately severe scalp psoriasis from a Scottish NHS perspective. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Treatment pathways for scalp psoriasis patients in primary care were defined by Scottish prescribing statistics, an interview programme and published sources. The extensive 1-year Markov model included 12 different topical treatment pathways, each simulating three lines of therapy. Seven pathways contained the TCF gel in first-, second- or third-line. The remaining five pathways were included as comparators, reflecting the heterogeneity across clinical practice. The cost effectiveness of TCF gel was compared to the average of five non-TCF gel pathways. The clinical effectiveness measure was the ability of topical treatments to control disease at 4 weeks. Response rates were derived from indirect comparisons of ten randomised controlled trials. Utilities were elicited from SF-36 (v2) scores in one TCF gel trial. The main outcome was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the results. RESULTS: TCF gel used first-, second- or third-line was projected to increase QALYs (around 0.0025) with cost savings per patient (£20-30) over 1 year. The study analysis acknowledged a number of limitations including lack of quality comparator data, the need to make assumptions in the absence of evidence and lack of model validation. However the results showed that TCF gel was the dominant treatment strategy across a broad range of credible scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Scalp psoriasis is difficult to treat. Many different topical preparations can be used but several factors such as greasiness, irritation, time needed to apply, and lack of efficacy often result in reduced adherence to treatment regimens. Where cosmetic properties are important for patient acceptability and compliance is a major issue contributing to treatment failure, the once-daily TCF gel offers patients with scalp psoriasis an attractive, cost-saving treatment option. "
"Abstract: Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease and many patients require lifelong treatment. Characteristic scaly, itchy, unsightly psoriatic lesions affect many body areas and most patients commonly experience scalp involvement. The cosmetic embarrassment of visible body lesions, inaccessibility of scalp skin to application of therapies and proximity of sensitive facial skin add to the challenges of most patients managing their psoriasis long term. Psoriasis can severely impact patients' quality of life. This can impact significantly on the patient. In economic terms patients may incur increased out-of-pocket expenditure or extended time away from work as a direct consequence of psoriasis, particularly in severe cases; In many countries, specialist review of patients provides pressures on hard-pressed services and the costs of psoriasis care are substantial, particularly in patients with severe recalcitrant psoriasis which may require lengthy inpatient admission. Around 80% of patients with psoriasis have mild to moderately severe disease and the majority are treated with topical medicines by their physician in primary care. Despite the availability of a wide range of treatment options, regimens have been unsatisfactory, associated with patient dissatisfaction, poor compliance and often safety concerns with long-term use. Evidence-based clinical guidelines aim to improve healthcare of patients and while there are such guidelines for psoriasis, to date the challenges of (and recommendations for) managing scalp psoriasis are often limited or missing from these treatment guidelines. In the following in-journal supplement, a connected suite of five papers focus on the use of topical therapies for the treatment of the person afflicted with psoriasis. This work harnesses robust evidence from randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of topical therapies commonly used in psoriasis patients and translates this into recommendations for the most appropriate treatment of patients with body or scalp psoriasis, from an efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness perspective. Based upon systematic review and harnessing 'state of the art' evidence assessment methodologies, the modelling work suggests that the use of a two-compound formulation (TCF) product of calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate is the most appropriate treatment option for both body and scalp psoriasis. This Editorial acknowledges the results of any modelling exercise have limitations; indeed such limitations are acknowledged in each modelling contribution in this issue. With these caveats in mind, this introductory paper considers the implications of this research and distillation of the evidence. This work should guide cost-effective treatment choices for body and scalp psoriasis, assist in recommendations for management of scalp psoriasis in future iterations of psoriasis clinical guidelines and help primary care physicians striving to attain best outcomes in the care of the person with psoriasis. "
"OBJECTIVE: The efficacy of the two-compound formulation (TCF) product containing calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate applied once daily in psoriasis has been demonstrated in phase III trials but no randomised clinical trial comparing all commonly used topical treatments exists. The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of once-daily use of the TCF product relative to other commonly used topical agents in plaque psoriasis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data on change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score from baseline and PASI 75 (percentage of patients achieving a 75% reduction in PASI score), after 4 weeks of treatment were obtained by means of a systematic literature review of randomised controlled trials and synthesised with a Bayesian mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis. RESULTS: Relative to all active interventions, except for the unlicensed twice-daily application of the TCF product, the TCF once daily showed a greater efficacy based on PASI 75 response (relative risk ranging from 1.22 to 3.18) and improvement in PASI score from baseline (difference in % CFB PASI between TCF once daily and other active interventions ranged from 4.01 to 49.68). CONCLUSION: Among topical therapies evaluated, TCF once daily can be considered the most efficacious treatment for plaque psoriasis. "
"BACKGROUND: Specialized skin care regimens may help to minimize adverse events (AEs) following non-ablative facial procedures. METHODS: A 14-week, open-label, three-center study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a topical five-product system (Clinique Medical Optimizing Regimen; Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) for minimizing localized AEs during two 6-week procedure cycles with fractionated laser (FL) or intense pulsed light (IPL). The skin care regimen consisted of a 2-week preprocedure phase, a 1-week postprocedure phase, and a 3-week maintenance phase. Investigators and patients rated the presence and severity of erythema, itching, stinging/burning, edema, pain, pruritus, swelling, crusts/erosion, and photodamage. RESULTS: Two days after the FL/IPL treatment (IPL: n = 27; FL: n = 21), most assessments, including erythema, were near baseline values; at 4 weeks postprocedure, all investigator scores were comparable to baseline. Patients missed work or avoided social situations a mean of only 0.8 days. Mean subject ratings for itching, stinging/burning, pain, swelling, and redness for 2 weeks postprocedure were 'none' to 'mild'. Treatment-related AEs (acne, facial rash) occurred in four patients. All investigators stated they would recommend this topical over-the-counter regimen again in conjunction with non-ablative FL/IPL treatments. CONCLUSIONS: This topical five-product skin care system was safe and effective in conjunction with non-ablative FL/IPL procedures. "
"Abstract: Propolis, bee glue, and its main polyphenolic components show high antioxidant activity as found measuring their inhibitory action on lipid peroxidation of linoleic acid (LA) in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles. Furthermore, these substances evidence effectiveness as broad spectrum UVB and UVA photoprotection sunscreens, as it results by measurements of sun protection factor (SPF), the universal indicator related primarily to UVB radiations, and of the two parameters giving an indication of the UVA absorbance properties, i.e. UVA/UVB ratio and critical wavelength. The combination of these characteristics moves up propolis and its main polyphenolic components to the class of cosmeceuticals, as possible active ingredient of sunscreen commercial formulations for their protective and preventive properties. "
"Abstract: Tiaprofenic acid is a potent analgesic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and like any other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, oral administration of the conventional dosage forms of tiaprofenic acid invariably causes gastrointestinal side effects. In an effort to eliminate these side effects while enhancing the drug concentration at the target tissue, an epidermal application of tiaprofenic acid seems to be an effective alternative drug delivery modality. This study attempts to demonstrate the influence of different terpenes (d-limonene, menthol and nerolidol) in various combinations of preparations on the percutaneous penetration of tiaprofenic acid from Carbopol(®) 940 based gel formulations (1%) in an ex vivo experiment using Franz-type diffusion cells. The enhancement effect of terpenes on skin absorption of tiaprofenic acid was further evaluated by an in vivo method in rats. Amongst the terpenes used, d-limonene was the most outstanding penetration enhancer that was reference to penetration of tiaprofenic acid through rat skin ex vivo. In vivo penetration study shows that the AUC₀(-)₄₈(h) was increased by about 10 fold by the addition of 5% d-limonene to the formulation. Histological studies show that d-limonene causes disruption on the skin surface and is responsible for enhanced penetration of tiaprofenic acid. Since tiaprofenic acid is known to cause gastrointestinal disturbances following systemic administration, topical formulations of tiaprofenic acid in gel form including 5% d-limonene could be suggested as an alternative. "
"Abstract: The objective of the current study was to formulate oxybenzone into nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) to enhance its sunscreening efficacy and safety. NLCs of oxybenzone were prepared by the solvent diffusion method. A complete 2(3) factorial design was used for the evaluation of the prepared oxybenzone NLCs. The study design involves the investigation of the effect of three independent variables namely liquid lipid type (Miglyol 812 and oleic acid), liquid lipid concentration (15% and 30%), and oxybenzone concentration (5% and 10% with respect to total lipids) on the particle size (p.s.) , the entrapment efficiency (EE%) and the in vitro drug release after 8 h. The prepared NLCs were spherical in overall shape and were below 0.8 microm. Miglyol 812 and 30% liquid lipid were found to significantly decrease the p.s. and increase the EE% when compared to oleic acid and 15% liquid lipid. Increasing oxybenzone concentration increased significantly the p.s. but did not affect the EE%. NLCs prepared using Miglyol 812, 15% liquid lipid, and 10% oxybenzone showed slower drug release when compared to those prepared using oleic acid, 30% liquid lipid, and 5% oxybenzone, respectively. The candidate oxybenzone-loaded NLC dispersion was then formulated into gel. The incorporation of oxybenzone into NLCs greatly increased the in vitro sun protection factor and erythemal UVA protection factor of oxybenzone more than six- and eightfold, respectively, while providing the advantage of overcoming side effects of free oxybenzone as evidenced by very low irritation potential.

"INTRODUCTION: Bioequivalence of Equoral has been suggested by measurements of pharmacokinetic parameters in healthy volunteers and in stable renal transplant recipients, but not study in allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT) recipients. The aim of our study was to compare the pharmacokinetics and safety of Equoral to Neoral solution among ASCT recipients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our open-label, two-way crossover, randomized controlled trial compared Equoral versus Neoral solutions in ASCT recipients. The 30 enrolled patients from June 2007 to November 2008 had a 7 to 14-day duration of the test period. A 10-point blood sampling from 0 to 12 hours measured Cmax (extent of absorption), tmax (rate of absorption) and AUC(0-12h) (area under the concentration-time curve) calculated by the linear trapezoid rule. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee. RESULTS: Median age was 26 years (range = 6-47). The mean pharmacokinetic features were: AUC(0-12h): Equoral 4162 ± 1231 ng·mL/h vs Neoral 4370 ± 1059 ng·mL/h (P = .50); Cmax: Equoral 821 ± 244 ng/mL vs Neoral 834 ± 298 ng/mL (P = .86); and tmax: 105 minutes for both formulations. Comparable toxicities and rates of graft-versus-host disease were recorded in both groups. CONCLUSION: We suggest that Equoral and Neoral solution can be considered interchangeable in ASCT recipients. "
"Abstract: In large vessel vasculitis, including giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis, as well as in polymyalgia rheumatica, glucocorticoid therapy is the treatment of choice. However, there are two situations/questions for additional immunosuppressive therapies in these diseases: (i) therapy resistance to glucocorticoid mono-therapy; (ii) situations which call for sparing of glucocorticoids such as in complications of glucocorticoid therapy. This review summarises the current scientific debate on the effects of methotrexate in these diseases. Methotrexate at 10-15 mg/week appears to have a modest and delayed effect in GCA and PMR in reducing relapse rate and lowering the cumulative dose of glucocorticoid therapy. However, superiority of combination therapy in reducing the incidence of glucocorticoid-related complications has not been shown yet. The effects of higher doses and long-time effects as well as the efficacy in patients with glucocorticoid-resistance and complications are unclear. Methotrexate may thus be considered as adjunctive therapy to glucocorticoid therapy in glucocorticoid-resistance or complications. Further attempts should be made for a better identification of patients with glucocorticoid-refractory courses and a more precise formulation of guidelines on indication, optimal dosing and duration.

"Abstract: Magnetic micro- and nanoparticles based on ferrofluid (maghemite) were elaborated by inverse emulsion crosslinking of sodium salt of carboxymethylcellulose (CMCNa) and gelatin. Crosslinking was carried out with glutaric aldehyde within aqueous droplets dispersed into toluene in presence of surfactants. The influence of parameters such as the ratio of polymers and maghemite in the initial mixture on the composition, size, size dispersity, particle swelling and their ability for drug inclusion was studied. The ability to take-up drugs is directly correlated with the degree of swelling and gelatin content within the particles. Particle size is between tens of nanometers and a few microns. The magnetic properties of particles are demonstrated from saturation magnetization (between 43 and 44 emu g(-1)) when their superparamagnetic character was shown by the absence of hysteresis on the magnetization curve. Polymer-drug systems elaborated under particles keep their bactericide activity for at least 48 h. The absence of toxicity, associated with the bactericide activity, make these systems potential drug carriers. "
"Abstract: The effect of chemical enhancers and iontophoresis on the in vitro transbuccal delivery of 0.5% ondansetron HCl (ODAN HCl) was investigated using porcine buccal tissue. The chemical enhancers used were dodecyl 2-(N,N-dimethyl amino) propionate (DDAIP), its HCl salt dodecyl-2-(N,N-dimethylamino) propionate hydrochloride (DDAIP HCl), N-(4-bromobenzoyl)-S,S-dimethyliminosulfurane (Br-iminosulfurane), and azone. This study demonstrated that anodal iontophoresis at 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 mA current intensity significantly increased transbuccal delivery of ODAN HCl 3.3-fold, 5.2-fold and 7.1-fold respectively, compared to control. DDAIP HCl provided significantly higher transbuccal delivery of ODAN HCl than did DDAIP, azone and Br-iminosulfurane. It was found that DDAIP HCl in water significantly enhanced drug permeability (920 μg/cm(2)) compared to DDAIP HCl in propylene glycol (PG) (490 μg/cm(2)) during 24h. It was also found that 5% (w/v) DDAIP HCl in water alone provided higher permeation flux (29.3 μg/cm(2)/h) than iontophoresis alone at 0.3 mA (22.8 μg/cm(2)/h) during the same 8h treatment. A light microscopy study showed that treatment with chemical enhancers and iontophoresis did not cause major morphological changes in the buccal tissue. EpiOral™ MTS cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that DDAIP HCl at less than 5% (w/v) in water did not have significant detrimental effects on the cells. "
"Abstract: The absorption of filter substances in sunscreens, reducing the incident ultraviolet (UV) radiation, is the basis for the protecting ability of such formulations. The erythema-correlated sun protection factor (SPF), depending mainly on the intensity of the UVB radiation, is the common value to quantify the efficacy of the formulations avoiding sunburn. An ex vivo method combining tape stripping and optical spectroscopy is applied to measure the absorption of sunscreens in the entire UV spectral range. The obtained relations between the short-wavelength UV (UVB) absorption and the SPF confirm a clear influence of the long-wavelength UV (UVA) absorption on the SPF values. The data reflect the historical development of the relation of the concentration of UVB and UVA filters in sunscreens and points to the influence of additional ingredients, e.g., antioxidants and cell-protecting agents on the efficacy of the products. "
"Abstract: Interest in and interventions for photodamaged skin have dramatically increased over the last few years. Although a number of topical therapies have been used for the treatment of photodamaged skin, many therapies remain unproven in efficacy, unapproved, or only supported with limited clinical evidence. Topical retinoids, particularly tretinoin, are the most extensively studied. They have been shown to attenuate and reverse the signs of photodamage, such as coarse wrinkling. In addition, the clinical changes achieved with tretinoin are accompanied by histologic evidence of benefit. The main drawbacks to retinoid use are local irritation and erythema that can limit utility in some patients. New retinoids and formulations specifically optimized to improve cutaneous tolerability have been introduced. Two case reports of patients using low-concentration tretinoin gel 0.05% for the treatment of photodamaged skin are discussed. Over a relatively short treatment period of 4 weeks, tretinoin gel 0.05% was shown to provide both chemoprevention and reversal of photodamage. "
"Abstract: Hydroquinone has been the standard prescription agent for skin lightening; however, its use recently has become controversial. Hydroquinone is banned in Europe and parts of Asia because of potential long-term consequences, including carcinogenesis when orally consumed. These concerns have stimulated research to develop alternative skin lightening agents with efficacy comparable to hydroquinone but with a better safety profile. This double-blind study examined the skin lightening ability of a topical formulation containing kojic acid, emblica extract, and glycolic acid compared with prescription generic hydroquinone cream 4%. Eighty multiethnic participants with mild to moderate facial dyschromia were randomly assigned to use the study product or hydroquinone 4% twice daily for 12 weeks to evaluate product efficacy, tolerability, and safety using investigator assessment, participant assessment, and dermospectrophotometry. Study results demonstrated efficacy parity between the study product and hydroquinone 4%. Thus this novel skin lightening preparation is an alternative to hydroquinone 4% for participants with mild to moderate facial dyschromia. "
"Abstract: Systemic therapies with retinoic acid (RA) can result in toxic side effects without yielding biologically effective levels in target tissues such as lung. The authors adapted a PARI LC Star nebulizer to create a tubular system for short-term inhalation treatment of guinea pigs using a water-miscible formulation of all-trans RA (ATRA) or vehicle. Based on the initial average weight, animals received an estimated average ATRA doses of either 0.32 mg·kg(-1) (low dose, 1.4 mM), or 0.62 mg·kg(-1) (medium dose, 2.8 mM), or 1.26 mg·kg(-1) (high dose, 5.6 mM) 20 minutes per day for 6 consecutive days. This system led to a rise of ATRA levels in lung, but not liver or plasma. Cellular lung levels of retinol, retinyl palmitate, and retinyl stearate also appeared to be unaffected (245.6 ± 10.7, 47.4 ± 3.4, and 132.8 ± 7.7 ng·g(-1) wet weight, respectively). The application of this aerosolized ATRA also induced a dose-dependent protein expression of the cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (CRBP-1) in lung, without apparent harmful side effects. "
"BACKGROUND: There is evidence that excessive protease activity in the skin is an important factor in the development of atopic dermatitis. SRD44 is a topically formulated novel protease inhibitor that selectively inhibits Staphylococcal-derived aureolysin and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). METHODS: This was a double-blind, vehicle-controlled randomized trial conducted in thirteen hospital dermatology outpatient clinics in Germany (9), Bulgaria (3) and Finland (1). Ninety-three out of 103 screened adult subjects with confirmed atopic dermatitis affecting ≤ 20% of body surface area, with an IGA score of 2 or 3 at randomization were randomized following a washout period to either SRD441 ointment or matching vehicle twice daily for 28 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the clearance of Atopic dermatitis (AD score of 0 or 1 IGA) at Day 21. Secondary endpoints included measures of SCORing Atopic Dermatitis, pruritus self-assessment, rescue medication use and occurrence of new exacerbations. A range of safety and tolerance endpoints were included. RESULTS: There were no significant treatment differences in IGA success rates at Day 21 (SRD441 ointment, 11.1%; vehicle ointment, 12.5%; P = 1.000). Evaluation of secondary efficacy variables revealed no clinical or important statistical differences between treatment groups. Eighteen subjects (19.4%) discontinued the study drug because of an AE (seven subjects [15.6%] in the SRD441 group and 11 subjects [22.9%] in the vehicle group). Twenty-seven subjects (60.0%) in the SRD441 group and 34 subjects (70.8%) in the vehicle group reported an adverse event (AE). CONCLUSIONS: SRD441 ointment did not demonstrate efficacy in the treatment of atopic dermatitis raising questions on the effectiveness of MMPs as a target for the treatment of atopic dermatitis.

"BACKGROUND: Ondansetron is increasingly used to prevent emesis in children with acute gastroenteritis; however, the optimal dose is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine if higher doses of oral ondansetron are associated with greater efficacy or side effects. METHODS: We analyzed data from a prospective clinical trial performed between January 2004 and April 2005. Data were collected on 105 children with dehydration due to gastroenteritis who received an ondansetron oral disintegrating formulation. The following outcomes of efficacy were analyzed: number of vomiting episodes, volume of oral rehydration fluids consumed, percent weight gain, and the proportions of children who had ongoing vomiting, received intravenous rehydration, and were hospitalized. In addition, the number of episodes of diarrhea was evaluated to measure whether there were dose-dependent side effects. RESULTS: Participants were aged 0.5-8.2 years and the dose ranged between 0.13 and 0.26 mg/kg. There was no significant association between the dose of ondansetron and the outcomes of number of vomiting episodes, volume of fluids consumed, increase in bodyweight, or number of diarrhea episodes/hour. The mean dose of ondansetron (mg/kg) administered was not different amongst those who did and did not have ongoing vomiting, undergo hospitalization, and receive intravenous rehydration. CONCLUSIONS: Within the dose range of 0.13-0.26 mg/kg, higher doses of ondansetron were not superior to lower doses, nor were they associated with increased side effects. Thus, ondansetron in this dose range was shown to result in a similar reduction in emesis in children with acute gastroenteritis. "
"BACKGROUND: Selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) is a second generation MEK inhibitor that is currently in clinical trials for various solid malignancies. MEK kinase inhibitors are associated with dermatologic toxicities. While reactions affecting the skin, hair and nails to other targeted agents, such as epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRIs) have been abundantly described in recent years, the dermatologic toxicities associated with MEK inhibitors have not been well characterized. Similarly, their management may present a challenge in clinical trials. We reviewed the clinical presentation, evolution and management of dermatologic toxicities associated with selumetinib. METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records of 11 patients referred to the Dermatology Service with dermatologic toxicities secondary to selumetinib was performed. Data from two phase II trials in which selumetinib was used to treat advanced metastatic cutaneous, mucosal, or uveal melanomas were reviewed. Parameters studied included the time to onset, clinical presentation, histology and management. In addition, the clinical database was accessed to retrieve clinical photographs when available. RESULTS: Eight patients received selumetinib suspension orally at 100 mg twice a day and three patients received a newer capsule formulation at the maximum tolerated dose of 75 mg with the same frequency. The following adverse effects were observed: papulopustular rash (100%), xerosis (36%), pruritus (45%), fissures (9%), telangiectasias (27%), hyperpigmentation (9%), alopecia (9%), angular cheilitis (9%), and paronychia (9%). In addition, secondary bacterial infection with Staphylococcus aureus was documented in 3 patients (27%). CONCLUSIONS: Dermatologic side-effects associated with selumetinib were similar to those seen with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRIs). Treatment approaches used for EGFRI-induced dermatologic reactions may be potentially utilized to manage those associated with selumetinib. "
"BACKGROUND: The heated lidocaine/tetracaine patch (Synera; ZARS Pharma, Inc, Salt Lake City, UT) is among the local topical anesthetic formulations used to prevent procedural pain. This study was conducted to determine the depth and duration of anesthesia provided by the patch and to evaluate safety and tolerability. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period crossover study was conducted in healthy subjects. Subjects were randomized to receive either the heated lidocaine/tetracaine patch (active patch) in period 1 and placebo patch in period 2 or vice versa. Patches were applied for 30 mins to the volar aspect of the forearm. Pain and sensory depths were measured at baseline and at 30, 60, 90, and 150 mins after patch application. Duration of anesthesia was measured at 40, 70, 110, and 130 mins after patch application by evaluating thermal and mechanical sensation. RESULTS: A total of 25 subjects were enrolled in the study. Twenty-four subjects completed the study. Pain and sensory depths with the active patch were greater than with placebo (P < 0.001) at all postdose time points. Maximum mean pain depth achieved with the active patch was 8.22 mm; anesthesia lasted at least 100 mins after patch removal. Cool and warm sensations and hot pain thresholds were increased compared with placebo (P < 0.001). Light touch and pinprick were detectable by most subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The heated lidocaine/tetracaine patch is well tolerated, and it provides favorable depth and duration of anesthesia without significant sensory loss for superficial venous access and minor dermatological procedures after a 30-min application.

"Abstract: The calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate two-compound scalp formulation has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of scalp psoriasis over 8 weeks, but the patients studied were mainly White and non-Hispanic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the two-compound scalp formulation in the treatment of scalp psoriasis in Hispanic/Latino and Black/African American patients. A total of 99 Hispanic/Latino and 78 Black/African American patients were randomized double-blind in a 3:1 ratio to 8 weeks of once daily treatment of scalp psoriasis with either the two-compound scalp formulation (n=135) or its vehicle (n=42). In the two-compound group, 71.9% of patients had cleared or minimal disease at week 8 by the investigator's global assessment compared to 40.5% in the vehicle group (odds ratio 3.30; 95% CI 1.62-6.72; P<0.001). For the five secondary efficacy response criteria, three (total sign score, thickness of scalp psoriasis, patient's global assessment) showed that two-compound scalp formulation was statistically significantly more effective than its vehicle, and the other two (redness and scaliness of scalp psoriasis) approached statistical significance in favor of the two-compound scalp formulation. There was no statistically significant difference (P=1.00) between the percentage of patients with adverse reactions in the two-compound group (7.0%) and the vehicle group (7.9%). The two-compound scalp formulation is safe and effective in the treatment of scalp psoriasis over 8 weeks in Hispanic/Latino and Black/African American patients. "
"Abstract: Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a chronic and potentially sight-threatening disease. Topical corticosteroids (Cs) seem to be the only effective treatment for this condition, although severe side effects may occur owing to their prolonged use. More recently, cyclosporine (Cyc) eye drops have been reported as a valid alternative, but so far such treatment has only been successfully experimented for a short time and in small numbers of patients. The aim of our study is to evaluate the long term safety and efficacy of topical cyclosporine eye drops in children suffering from VKC. Over a period of 7 years we followed a large group of children suffering from severe VKC. They were selected to start cyclosporine eye drop treatment, because of the prompt relapse of their disease as soon as they stopped topical corticosteroids administration. All patients were followed-up in an ambulatory care assessment. A total of 156 children with VKC were treated with topical cyclosporine eye drops over a period ranging from two to seven years [mean time 3.8 +/- 1.09 years] during the seasonal relapse [range 9-66 months; mean time 24.7+/-10.4 months]. Two formulations, at 1% and 2% (82% and 18%, respectively) concentrations, of cyclosporine eye drops were made. The dosage administered was one drop in each eye from two to four times a day, depending on the severity of the disease and the season. The ocular objective scores were determined and compared every year, at the beginning and at the end of each treatment period. Blood samples were collected once a year in order to check both kidney and liver functions, as well as cyclosporine serum levels. We enrolled 156 patients (mean age 8.31+/-2.79 years; 116 males and 40 females) who were followed-up over a period of 7 years [156 (100%) children during the first and the second year; 138 (88.5%) patients until the third year; 90 (57.7%) until the fourth year; 32 (20.5%) until the fifth year; 10 (6.4%) until the sixth year and 2 (1.3%) until the seventh year]. The ocular objective scores significantly improved (p less than 0.001) over the years when comparing them at the beginning and the end of each seasonal treatment period, except for the last year. Over the treatment period, non-significant changes were recorded in terms of kidney and liver enzymatic activities and also in terms of cyclosporine serum levels. Cyclosporine eye drops, either at 1% or 2% concentrations, resulted safe and effective for long-term treatment of VKC in 156 children. The lack of significance of the score results during the seventh year can be explained by the small number of subjects treated for such a long period. A systematic ocular examination and both liver and kidney functional investigations allowed us to exclude the possibility of local or systemic side effects due to cyclosporine. If either transient or long-lasting, the occurrence of burning was referred by some of the patients treated, but none of them required to discontinue the drug. In conclusion, this is the first study showing that topical cyclosporine is easily handled even by children, with safe and effective results even when it is used over a long period of time. Our findings, though encouraging, need to be confirmed by further studies. "
"PURPOSE: The goals of this study were (1) to compare the injury at the basement membrane zone (BMZ) of rabbit corneal organ cultures exposed to half mustard (2 chloroethyl ethyl sulfide, CEES) and nitrogen mustard with that of in vivo rabbit eyes exposed to sulfur mustard (SM); (2) to test the efficacy of 4 tetracycline derivatives in attenuating vesicant-induced BMZ disruption in the 24-h period postexposure; and (3) to use the most effective tetracycline derivative to compare the improvement of injury when the drug is delivered as drops or hydrogels to eyes exposed in vivo to SM. METHODS: Histological analysis of hematoxylin and eosin–stained sections was performed; the ultrastructure of the corneal BMZ was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy; matrix metalloproteinase-9 was assessed by immunofluorescence; doxycycline as drops or a hydrogel was applied daily for 28 days to eyes exposed in vivo to SM. Corneal edema was assessed by pachymetry and the extent of neovascularization was graded by length of longest vessel in each quadrant. RESULTS: Injury to the BMZ was highly similar with all vesicants, but varied in degree of severity. The effectiveness of the 4 drugs in retaining BMZ integrity did not correlate with their ability to attenuate matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression at the epithelial–stromal border. Doxycycline was most effective on organ cultures; therefore, it was applied as drops or a hydrogel to rabbit corneas exposed in vivo to SM. Eyes were examined at 1, 3, 7, and 28 days after exposure. At 7 and 28 days after SM exposure, eyes treated with doxycycline were greatly improved over those that received no therapy. Corneal thickness decreased somewhat faster using doxycycline drops, whereas the hydrogel formulation decreased the incidence of neovascularization. CONCLUSIONS: Corneal cultures exposed to 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide and nitrogen mustard were effective models to simulate in vivo SM exposures. Doxycycline as drops and hydrogels ameliorated vesicant injury. With in vivo exposed animals, the drops reduced edema faster than the hydrogels, but use of the hydrogels significantly reduced neovascularization. The data provide proof of principle that a hydrogel formulation of doxycycline as a daily therapy for ocular vesicant injury should be further investigated. "
"Abstract: Titanium dioxide and zinc oxide nanomaterials, used as UV protecting agents in sunscreens, were investigated for their potential genotoxicity in in vitro and in vivo test systems. Since standard OECD test methods are designed for soluble materials and genotoxicity testing for nanomaterials is still under revision, a battery of standard tests was used, covering different endpoints. Additionally, a procedure to disperse the nanomaterials in the test media and careful characterization of the dispersed test item was added to the testing methods. No genotoxicity was observed in vitro (Ames' Salmonella gene mutation test and V79 micronucleus chromosome mutation test) or in vivo (mouse bone marrow micronucleus test and Comet DNA damage assay in lung cells from rats exposed by inhalation). These results add to the still limited data base on genotoxicity test results with nanomaterials and provide congruent results of a battery of standard OECD test methods applied to nanomaterials. "
"Abstract: The immunosuppressive agent Cyclosporin A (CsA) has very poor solubility in water and, in consequence, non-aqueous formulations have been developed for its intravenous administration to treat patients with transplant rejection. In this article, aqueous micelle solutions of novel amphiphilic copolymers based on methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol) (MPEG) and hexyl-substituted poly(lactides) (hexPLA) were studied for possible incorporation and formulation of CsA, and for their biocompatibility towards novel pharmaceutical applications. Above the critical micellar concentration (CMC), MPEG-hexPLA block-copolymers self-assemble into unimodal micelles with diameters of around 30 nm, either unloaded or drug-loaded. The best shelf-life stability of these formulations was observed when stored at 4°C with a drug loss inferior to 7% after 1 year. The polymer and micelle toxicities were evaluated in vitro for three different cell lines and in vivo using the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. The hemolytic property was assessed using human blood samples. As the studies revealed, MPEG-hexPLAs are non-toxic and do not show hemolysis; the same was found for the comparable MPEG-PLAs, both as unimers below their CMC and as polymeric micelles up to copolymer concentrations of 20 mg/mL. At this concentration, CsA was efficiently incorporated into MPEG-hexPLA micelles up to 6 mg/mL, which corresponds to a 500-fold increase of its water solubility. The current recommended clinical concentration administered per infusion (0.5-2.5 mg/mL) can be easily achieved and requires four times less copolymer than with the often-used Cremophor®EL surfactant. In this regard, MPEG-hexPLA micelle formulations can be an applicable formulation in transplant rejection treatments as an injectable CsA carrier system. "
"Abstract: Vitamin A palmitate has been used in cosmetics; however, studies report that this substance shows photoreactivity that can lead to loss of safety and efficacy. On the other hand, photostabilizers have been used to increase sunscreen photostability and consequently their safety and effectiveness. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the influence of photostabilizers on the photoprotective effects of a cosmetic formulation containing UV-filters and vitamin A palmitate. The formulation containing UV-filters was supplemented with vitamin A palmitate and the photostabilizers diethylhexyl 2,6-naphthalate (DEHN), bumetrizole and benzotriazolyl dodecyl p-cresol (BTDC). Hairless mice were treated daily by topical applications and irradiated (UVA/B). Erythema index, transepidermal water loss, histological/histometric analysis and number of sunburn cells (SBC) were evaluated. The results showed that all formulations protected from UV-induced enhancement of erythema and SBC but there was no difference among them. The formulation with no stabilizers reduced viable epidermis thickness due to atrophy induced by UV radiation. Thus, it can be concluded that the presence of photostabilizers influenced the effects of formulations containing UV-filters and vitamin A palmitate, which could be seen by histological and histometric analysis. Furthermore, the formulations containing the stabilizers DEHN and BTDC showed better protective effects on hairless mice skin. "
"Abstract: A randomized, two-way, crossover, bioequivalence study in 6 beagle dogs was conducted to compare the bioavailability of two peppermint oil formulations, soft capsule and hard capsule. The drug was given in a single dose of two capsules (total, 200 mg), and blood samples were withdrawn during the 12 h after drug administration. Menthol (CAS 2216-51-5) as the main component of peppermint oil was determined by a gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/I MS) method after cleavage with beta-glucuronidase. The following pharmacokinetic variables were computed for the two formulations: maximum concentration (Cmax), time to maximum concentration (Tmax), half-life of elimination (t1/2), mean residence time (MRT), and areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-infinity)). For calculation of the 90% confidence interval (CI), an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out. The results indicated that treatment and subject had statistically significant effect on AUC(0-t), AUC(0-infinity), and Cmax, and the 90% CIs for AUC(0-t), AUC(0-infinity), and Cmax were outside the acceptable bioequivalence range. The relative bioavailability was 121.4 +/- 10.6% for AUC(0-infinity). Therefore, it can be concluded that the two formulations are not bioequivalent and the bioavailability of soft capsules is significantly higher than that of hard capsules. "
"Abstract: The objective of the present study was to formulate and characterize Acitretin loaded Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (ActNLCs), to understand in vitro drug release and clinically evaluate the role of the developed gel in the topical treatment of psoriasis. ActNLCs were prepared by solvent diffusion technique using 3(2) full factorial design. The mean diameter and surface morphology of ActNLC was evaluated. ActNLCs were lyophilized and crystallinity of NLC was characterized by Differential Scanning Calorimtery (DSC) and powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The NLCs were incorporated in 1% w/w Carbopol 934 P gel base and in vitro skin deposition studies in Human Cadaver Skin and double-blind clinical studies in psoriatic patients were conducted. The optimized ActNLCs were spherical in shape, with average particle size of 223(±8.92)nm, zeta potential of -26.4 (±0.86) mV and EE of 63.0(±1.54)%. DSC and XRD data confirmed the formation of NLCs. Significantly higher deposition of Acitretin was found in human cadaver skin from ActNLC gel (81.38 ±1.23%) as compared to Act plain gel (47.28±1.02%). Clinical studies demonstrated significant improvement in therapeutic response and reduction in local side effects with ActNLCs loaded gel indicated its effectiveness in the topical treatment of Psoriasis.

"Abstract: A new fixed-dose combination formulation of adapalene 0.1% and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) 2.5% has shown excellent efficacy and safety in registration studies; however, it can be difficult to judge the real-world performance of a product using only the results from controlled clinical trials. This 12-week, open-label, community-based study evaluated adapalene/BPO in 91 patients with mild to moderate acne (20-50 inflammatory lesions and 30-100 noninflammatory lesions) who were treated at dermatology centers throughout Argentina. The study evaluated efficacy, described the most common side effects, determined tolerability, and assessed the level of patient satisfaction with treatment. By week 12, there were statistically significant reductions in both inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions (80.6% and 69.3% from baseline, respectively; P < .001); there were also significant improvements in the Investigator's Global Assessment scores (median score, 2.9 at baseline and 1.0 at week 12; P < .001). By week 12, 67% of patients were rated clear or almost clear by investigators. Local tolerability was good overall. When cutaneous irritation was present, it typically occurred in the first 2 weeks of treatment and improved or resolved with continuing therapy. Patients were highly satisfied with the results of treatment, and 74% of patients felt that they had marked or total improvement by week 12. Patient survey also revealed that 94% rated the efficacy as good or very good and 87.5% rated tolerability as good or very good. A significant majority (81%) felt that the treatment met expectations, and 62% perceived that improvement had been rapid during adapalene/BPO therapy. These results demonstrate that adapalene/BPO has good efficacy and tolerability in routine practice, resulting in continuous reductions in lesion counts throughout the study. Adapalene/BPO therapy is also associated with high patient satisfaction, which is important for therapeutic adherence and satisfaction with the physician's care. "
"Abstract: This work is a follow-up of our previous paper (Heinlaan et al., 2008. Chemosphere 71, 1308-1316) where we showed about 50-fold higher acute toxicity of CuO nanoparticles (NPs) compared to bulk CuO to water flea Daphnia magna. In the current work transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to determine potential time-dependent changes in D. magna midgut epithelium ultrastructure upon exposure to CuO NPs compared to bulk CuO at their 48 h EC(50) levels: 4.0 and 175 mg CuO/L, respectively. Special attention was on potential internalization of CuO NPs by midgut epithelial cells. Ingestion of both CuO formulations by daphnids was evident already after 10 min of exposure. In the midgut lumen CuO NPs were dispersed whereas bulk CuO was clumped. By the 48th hour of exposure to CuO NPs (but not to equitoxic concentrations of bulk CuO) the following ultrastructural changes in midgut epithelium of daphnids were observed: protrusion of epithelial cells into the midgut lumen, presence of CuO NPs in circular structures analogous to membrane vesicles from holocrine secretion in the midgut lumen. Implicit internalization of CuO NPs via D. magna midgut epithelial cells was not evident however CuO NPs were no longer contained within the peritrophic membrane but located between the midgut epithelium microvilli. Interestingly, upon exposure to CuO NPs bacterial colonization of the midgut occurred. Ultrastructural changes in the midgut of D. magna upon exposure to CuO NPs but not to bulk CuO refer to its nanosize-related adverse effects. Time-dependent solubilisation of CuO NPs and bulk CuO in the test medium was quantified by recombinant Cu-sensor bacteria: by the 48th hour of exposure to bulk CuO, the concentration of solubilised copper ions was 0.05 ± 0.01 mg Cu/L that was comparable to the acute EC(50) value of Cu-ions to D. magna (48 h CuSO(4) EC(50) = 0.07 ± 0.01 mg Cu/L). However, in case of CuO NPs, the solubilised Cu-ions 0.01 ± 0.001 mg Cu/L, explained only part of the toxicity. "
"OBJECTIVE: While several studies have examined adherence to controller medications for the treatment of COPD, few systematic reviews have taken the translational step to identifying important and necessary areas for further research. The objective of this study was to review data on the outcomes of adherence to various controller therapies in patients with COPD in an effort to help prescribers understand adherence properties for each therapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a systematic review of studies investigating adherence to an array of controller pharmaceutical regimens. The studies were obtained from PubMed during 2008 and 2009 using the following key words: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, adherence, controller medication, and persistence. Only articles encompassing adherence or persistence data to controller medications and published after 1990 were utilized. RESULTS: After the search results were filtered for only the articles that pertained to adherence or persistence measurements in COPD, 35 articles remained; and finally, discounting those articles not published in English, articles which did not compare treatments for COPD, as well as those which were review articles, ten applicable articles remained. Each of these found low levels of medication adherence and/or persistence among patients receiving medications for COPD. Patients receiving fluticasone/salmeterol (FSC) and tiotropium (TIO) for treatment showed the highest adherence among all controller medications. Patients who were married, older, and white were more likely to adhere to their medications. CONCLUSION: Characteristics of the medication used (i.e. dosing schedule, formulation, etc.) as well as patient characteristics affect the adherence/persistence to medications for the treatment of COPD. Further patient education is necessary in order to effectively improve disease management and patient outcomes in COPD. There is a need for future research and educational efforts to improve adherence in COPD and more clearly identify specific behavioral and treatment characteristics associated with specific COPD medications that can facilitate adherence.

"Abstract: In the case of cutaneous malignant or non-malignant diseases, topical photodynamic therapy (PDT) with a temoporfin (mTHPC)-containing formulation would be advantageous. Unfortunately, mTHPC is a highly hydrophobic drug with low percutaneous absorption and novel mTHPC-loaded invasomes for enhanced skin delivery were developed. The purpose of this study was to investigate photodynamic efficacy of mTHPC-loaded invasomes in vitro in two cell lines, i.e. the human colorectal tumour cell line HT29 and the epidermoid tumour cell line A431. Invasomes are vesicles containing besides phospholipids a mixture of terpenes or only one terpene and ethanol. Dark toxicity, phototoxicity and intracellular localization of mTHPC were studied. Laser scanning microscopy indicated perinuclear localization of mTHPC. Results revealed that mTHPC-invasomes and mTHPC-ethanolic solution used at a 2μM mTHPC-concentration and photoirradiation at 20J/cm(2) were able to reduce survival of HT29 cells and especially of A431 cells, being more sensitive to PDT. In contrast to HT29 cells, where there was not a significant difference between cytotoxicity of mTHPC-ethanolic solution and mTHPC-invasomes, in A431 cells mTHPC-invasomes were more cytotoxic. Survival of about 16% of A431 cells treated with mTHPC-invasomes is very promising, since it demonstrates invasomes' potential to be used in topical PDT of cutaneous malignant diseases. "
"Abstract: Being independent of artificial power sources, self administered sunlight triggered photodynamic therapy could be a suitable alternative treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis, that avoids the need for injectables and the toxic side effects of pentavalent antimonials. In this work we have determined the in vitro leishmanicidal activity of sunlight triggered photodynamic ultradeformable liposomes (UDL). ZnPc is a hydrophobic Zn phthalocyanine that showed 20% anti-promastigote activity (APA) and 20% anti-amastigote activity (AA) against Leishmania braziliensis (strain 2903) after 15min sunlight irradiation (15J/cm(2)). However, when loaded in UDL as UDL-ZnPc (1.25μM ZnPc-1mM phospholipids) it elicited 100% APA and 80% AA at the same light dose. In the absence of host cell toxicity, UDL and UDL-ZnPc also showed non-photodynamic leishmanicidal activity. Confocal laser scanning microscopy of cryosectioned human skin mounted in non-occlusive Saarbrücken Penetration Model, showed that upon transcutaneous administration ZnPc penetrated nearly 10 folds deeper as UDL-ZnPc than if loaded in conventional liposomes (L-ZnPc). Quantitative determination of ZnPc confirmed that UDL-ZnPc penetrated homogeneously in the stratum corneum, carrying 7 folds higher amount of ZnPc 8 folds deeper than L-ZnPc. It is envisioned that the multiple leishmanicidal effects of UDL-ZnPc could play a synergistic role in prophylaxis or therapeutic at early stages of the infection. "
"Abstract: Transdermal delivery of drugs has gained attention as an alternative to intravenous and oral methods of delivery. However, the skin permeation of drugs is generally poor. To overcome this problem, many permeation enhancers have been developed. In this study, ondansetron hydrogels were prepared, and their skin permeation and pharmacological effects were evaluated in mice. To prepare the hydrogels, a Box-Behnken design was introduced. Fifteen formulations of ondansetron hydrogels composed of hydroxyethylcellulose and hydroxypropylcellulose as gel bases, l-menthol as a penetration enhancer and isopropanol (IPA), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and water as a solvent were prepared. The quantities of IPA (X(1)), l-menthol (X(2)) and NMP (X(3)) were selected as causal factors. We performed an in vitro skin permeation study and an in vivo skin irritation study with the test hydrogels. The flux and the total irritation score were selected as response variables. The optimal formulation, one that has an appropriate penetration and an acceptable skin irritation score, was estimated using a nonlinear response surface method incorporating thin-plate spline interpolation. The optimal formulation also delivered the desired pharmacological activity. These results indicated the feasibility of delivering ondansetron transdermally. "
"Abstract: The systemic use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which act by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) is severely hampered by gastric and peptic ulcers. The topical delivery of NSAIDs has the advantages of avoiding gastric and peptic ulcers and delivering the drug to the inflammation site. Importance of aceclofenac as a new generational NSAID has inspired the development of topical dosage forms. This mode of administration may help to avoid typical side effects of NSAIDs associated with oral and systemic administration such as gastric irritation, particularly diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain and flatulence. The aim of this study was to formulate topical gel containing 1% of aceclofenac in carbopol and PEG base and to evaluate it for analgesic and antiinflammatory activity using carrageenan-induced thermal hyperalgesia and paw oedema in rats. Carrageenan administration into the hind paw produced a significant inflammation associated with hyperalgesia as shown by decreased rat paw withdrawal latency in response to a thermal stimulus (47+/-0.5 degrees C) 4 h after carrageenan injection. Topical application of AF1 significantly attenuated the development of hypersensitivity to thermal stimulus as compared to control (P<0.05) and other formulation treated groups (P<0.05). All the AF semisolid formulations, when applied topically 2 h before carrageenan administration, inhibited paw edema in a timedependent manner with maximum percent edema inhibition of 80.33+/-2.52 achieved with AF1 after 5 h of carrageenan administration However, topical application of AF2 markedly prevented the development of edema as compared to other formulation (AF2 and AF3) treated groups (P<0.05). Among all the semisolid formulations, Carbopol gel base was found to be most suitable dermatological base for aceclofenac. "
"Abstract: The broad spectrum herbicide glyphosate is widely used in agriculture worldwide. There has been ongoing controversy regarding the possible adverse effects of glyphosate on the environment and on human health. Reports of neural defects and craniofacial malformations from regions where glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH) are used led us to undertake an embryological approach to explore the effects of low doses of glyphosate in development. Xenopus laevis embryos were incubated with 1/5000 dilutions of a commercial GBH. The treated embryos were highly abnormal with marked alterations in cephalic and neural crest development and shortening of the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis. Alterations on neural crest markers were later correlated with deformities in the cranial cartilages at tadpole stages. Embryos injected with pure glyphosate showed very similar phenotypes. Moreover, GBH produced similar effects in chicken embryos, showing a gradual loss of rhombomere domains, reduction of the optic vesicles, and microcephaly. This suggests that glyphosate itself was responsible for the phenotypes observed, rather than a surfactant or other component of the commercial formulation. A reporter gene assay revealed that GBH treatment increased endogenous retinoic acid (RA) activity in Xenopus embryos and cotreatment with a RA antagonist rescued the teratogenic effects of the GBH. Therefore, we conclude that the phenotypes produced by GBH are mainly a consequence of the increase of endogenous retinoid activity. This is consistent with the decrease of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling from the embryonic dorsal midline, with the inhibition of otx2 expression and with the disruption of cephalic neural crest development. The direct effect of glyphosate on early mechanisms of morphogenesis in vertebrate embryos opens concerns about the clinical findings from human offspring in populations exposed to GBH in agricultural fields.

"Abstract: Three-dimensional in vitro skin models provide an alternative to animal testing for assessing tissue damage caused by chemical or physical agents and for the identification and characterization of agents formulated to mitigate this damage. The StrataTest® human skin model made with pathogen-free NIKS® keratinocyte progenitors is a fully-stratified tissue containing epidermal and dermal components that possesses barrier function as determined by measurements of electrical impedance. Independent batches of skin tissues responded consistently to known chemical irritants even after refrigerated storage for up to 7 days. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected after exposure of skin tissues to ozone, cigarette smoke or ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Pretreatment with the antioxidant parthenolide-depleted (PD)-Feverfew extract prevented cigarette smoke-induced or UV irradiation-mediated increases in ROS. Interleukin (IL)-1α and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) secretion increased in a dose dependent manner following UV irradiation but cytokine release was abrogated by pretreatment with a UVA/UVB sunscreen. Similarly, immunohistochemical detection showed increased thymidine dimer formation in UV-irradiated skin tissue that was prevented with sunscreen pretreatment. These results demonstrate that the StrataTest® human skin model is broadly applicable to a wide range of in vitro toxicological assays. "
"Abstract: Aquagenic wrinkling of the palms (AWP) is a condition that results in pain and edema of the hands after exposure to water. We describe a 32-year-old woman who presented with a several-year history of AWP. She was unable to tolerate a 20 percent aluminum chloride solution because of irritation, but a gel formulation of 15 percent aluminum chloride controlled her symptoms without side effects. "
"BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris is a common chronic skin disease affecting roughly 15 percent of the general population and up to 85 percent of adolescents and young adults. Adapalene, a synthetic naphthoic acid derivative with retinoid activity, has demonstrated good clinical efficacy in the treatment of acne if used with full compliance. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and assess safety of a new adapalene formulation, adapalene 0.1% lotion, versus the lotion vehicle in subjects with acne vulgaris. METHODS: Subjects were randomized to receive either adapalene 0.1% lotion or its vehicle once daily for 12 weeks in two multicenter, randomized, vehicle-controlled, double-blind, parallel group studies. Efficacy was evaluated using two co-primary endpoints: Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of success rate (defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a two point reduction, on a 5-point scale, from baseline to week 12 in IGA score); and the absolute change from baseline to week 12 in total, inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions. Signs of local skin irritation and routine clinical safety parameters were evaluated throughout both studies. RESULTS: In total, 2,141 subjects were included in the two studies: 1,068 patients received adapalene 0.1 percent lotion and 1073 received the vehicle. In both studies, adapalene 0.1% lotion was shown to be significantly more effective than its vehicle in improvement in the IGA success rate. Adapalene 0.1% lotion was also significantly superior to its vehicle in all three lesion reduction measures: total, inflammatory and non-inflammatory. Reports of application site skin irritation in the adapalene 0.1% lotion treatment group were transient and mild or moderate in severity, with only a few being severe. Additionally, according to patient surveys, the lotion formulation was found to be easily spreadable, easily absorbed and pleasant to use. CONCLUSION: Adapalene 0.1% lotion used once a day for 12 weeks is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of acne vulgaris. "
"BACKGROUND: Topical treatment of acne vulgaris on the back is challenging largely due to the extensive broad surface with difficult to reach areas. A ""leave-on"" foam is suited for application to the trunk due to ease of application and spreadability. Prior to this trial, no data on Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) reduction on the back has existed for any benzoyl peroxide (BP) formulations or other acne treatments. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of BP (5.3%) emollient foam and BP (8%) wash in reducing P. acnes levels on the back. METHODS: Five-week open-label single-center study of 20 healthy subjects (> 18 years old), colonized with P. acnes on their backs (> 10,000 colonies per cm2). Subjects were treated once daily with BP (5.3%) foam for two weeks; no treatment in week 3, and BP (8%) wash once daily for two further weeks. Quantitative bacteriologic cultures obtained at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6. RESULTS: Nineteen evaluable patients. Total P. acnes counts were reduced by 1.9 log (one week) and 2.1 log (two weeks) with BP (5.3%) emollient foam. BP (8%) wash did not reduce P. acnes counts after two weeks. DISCUSSION: BP (5.3%) emollient foam was superior to BP (8%) wash in reducing P. acnes on the back. The lack of effect of BP (8%) wash is surprising in view of the demonstrated results on the face and warrants further study. "
"Abstract: E6201 [(3S,4R,5Z,8S,9S,11E)-14-(ethylamino)-8,9,16-trihydroxy-3,4-dimethyl-3,4,9,10-tetrahydro-1H-2-benzoxacyclotetradecine-1,7(8H)-dione)] is a novel anti-inflammatory agent that has potent inhibitory effects on the production of proinflammatory cytokines from leukocytes and antiproliferative activity on keratinocytes. To characterize the in vivo pharmacological activity of E6201, topically administered E6201 was evaluated in several different animal models of dermatitis. E6201 formulated as an ointment or cream showed dose-dependent inhibition of croton oil-induced acute edema formation and neutrophil infiltration into mouse skin. In addition, E6201 cream inhibited the 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene-induced contact hypersensitivity reaction mediated by T cells in mice. In this model, E6201 cream also suppressed the migration of neutrophils and lymphocytes into the inflammatory site. Pretreatment with E6201 cream attenuated phorbol-12 myristate 13-acetate-induced ornithine decarboxylase activity, a marker of proliferation in epidermis. Furthermore, E6201 ointment showed inhibitory effects on both mezerein-induced and interleukin (IL)-23-induced epidermal hyperplasia. E6201 also suppressed T cell receptor-stimulated IL-17 production from human T cells. These results indicate that topically administered E6201 may be a useful agent for the prevention and treatment of cutaneous inflammatory and hyperproliferative diseases such as psoriasis. "
"Abstract: We propose a novel combination of high-throughput luminescent bacterial tests for the evaluation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating potential of engineered nanoparticles (eNPs) and the role of solubilised metal ions in this process. The set of tests consists of differently engineered recombinant Escherichia coli strains: (1) a new sensor strain, which bioluminescence is induced by superoxide anions; (2) six recombinant E. coli strains (superoxide dismutase (sod) single, double and triple mutants and a respective wild-type strain), transformed with luxCDABE genes responding to toxic compounds by decreasing their luminescence; and (3) three strains in which bioluminescence is specifically induced by bioavailable metals (Cu, Zn and Ag). The applicability of this battery of tests in profiling oxidative potential of eNPs was evaluated on nTiO(2), nCuO, nZnO and nAg (25, 30, 70 and <100 nm, respectively) NPs and fullerenes. As controls for the size or solubility, the bulk formulations (bTiO(2), bCuO and bZnO) and soluble salts (ZnSO(4), CuSO(4) and AgNO(3)) were also analysed. Bacterial toxicity tests showed that nCuO was four-fold more toxic, and nAg was 15-fold more toxic to triple sod mutant than to wild type (2-h EC(50) values were 8.1 and 2.0 mg Cu l(-1), respectively, and 46 and 3.1 mg Ag l(-1), respectively). Formation of ROS by nCuO and nAg was proved by superoxide anion-inducible strain. The metal sensor bacteria showed that the ROS formation by CuO NPs was caused by solubilised Cu ions, but in case of nAg, particles also had an effect. nZnO was remarkably more toxic to sod triple mutant than to wild type strain (2-h EC(50) were 4.5 and 54 mg Zn l(-1), respectively). Fullerenes inhibited the bioluminescence of sod triple mutant at 3,882 mg l(-1) but had no effect on the wild-type strain even at 20,800 mg l(-1). Nano and bTiO(2) showed some effect on viability of bacteria only at high concentrations (>4,000 mg l(-1)) although nTiO(2) (but not bTiO(2)) induced the bioluminescence of the superoxide anion sensing bacteria starting from 100 mg l(-1). Thus, our innovative combined approach is expected to provide more consistent and informative data concerning the general toxicity, ROS-production potential and also solubilisation of metals in the case of metallic NPs.

"Abstract: It has been clearly demonstrated that ultraviolet radiation is harmful to the skin and can cause helioderma and cancers. There are different methods of combating ultraviolet radiation: sunscreens formulated with filters and/or screens as well as clothing. For this work, the authors studied different fabrics to evaluate what effect the type, color and thickness of an article of clothing might have in terms of providing UVB (UPF) and UVA (UPF-UVA) protection. This study was conducted using a spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere and allowed the authors to discover that certain fabrics have UPF values which exceed 500, making them vastly superior to sunscreen creams. Synthetic fabrics appear to provide the highest level of sun protection. "
"Abstract: At present a wide range of photosensitizers are employed in photodynamic therapy (PDT) that have very different characteristics. Although, countless in vitro studies on the attributes of photosensitizers do exist, a direct comparison of these substances on one cell line are rare and may contribute to the choice of the optimal photoactive substance for a specific application. We therefore evaluated the properties of six widespread photosensitizers, namely Foscan, Fospeg, hypericin, aluminum (III) phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate chloride (AlPcS(4)), 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), and Photofrin in terms of: (i) cytotoxicity without illumination, (ii) phototoxicity, (iii) cellular uptake and release, and (iv) apoptosis induction in A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells using comparable illumination regimens. We clearly show that meso-tetrahydroxyphenylchlorin (mTHPC, Foscan) is a very effective photosensitizer inducing high phototoxicity at very low concentrations. Similar in vitro characteristics and phototoxicity were observed for Fospeg, the water-soluble formulation of mTHPC. Hypericin, a photosensitizer extracted from plants of the Hypericum genus, is very effective in inducing apoptosis over a wide range of light fluences. AlPcS(4) absorbs light of 674 nm wavelength providing a higher penetration depth in tissue. Its hydrophilic character allows for application as aqueous solution. ALA can be administered at very high concentrations without producing cytotoxic effects in the dark. The intracellular concentration of protoporphyrin IX rapidly decreases after withdrawal of ALA, thus minimizing the period of light sensitivity post PDT. Among all photosensitizers Photofrin has most clinical approvals and serves as standard. "
"UNLABELLED: IMPORTANCE IN THE FIELD: Activated cells metabolize albumin to cover their increased need for amino acids and energy. In inflamed, diseased and malignant tissue, extravasation of macromolecules into the tissue is upregulated. Drug carriers such as albumin have been used to target specifically diseased and malignant cells, resulting in higher efficacy of treatment and reduced side effects. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Owing to its advantageous biochemical and pharmacological properties, albumin has been regarded as an interesting candidate as a drug carrier. Covalent coupling to albumin carries drugs specifically to tumors and sites of inflammation, leading to reduced side effects as long as the native structure of albumin is unchanged. In this review, the means of coupling drugs to native albumin as well as exemplary studies for the use of albumin as drug carrier are summarized and discussed. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: An overview of the state-of-the-art using albumin as drug carrier for specific accumulation in tumors and inflammatory cells using the advantageous properties of native albumin is given in this review. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Native albumin is an effective drug carrier to sites of inflammation or malignancy. "
"BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) provides a therapeutic option for the treatment of actinic keratosis (AK). Different strategies are applied to overcome the chemical instability of ALA in solution and to improve skin penetration. A new stable nanoemulsion-based ALA formulation, BF-200 ALA, is currently in clinical development for PDT of AK. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of PDT of AK with BF-200 ALA. METHODS: The study was performed as a randomized, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, interindividual, two-armed trial with BF-200 ALA and placebo. A total of 122 patients with four to eight mild to moderate AK lesions on the face and/or the bald scalp were included in eight German study centres. The efficacy of BF-200 ALA after one and two PDT treatments was evaluated. BF-200 ALA was used in combination with two different light sources under illumination conditions defined by European competent authorities. RESULTS: PDT with BF-200 ALA was superior to placebo PDT with respect to patient complete clearance rate (per-protocol group: 64% vs. 11%; P < 0.0001) and lesion complete clearance rate (per-protocol group: 81% vs. 22%) after the last PDT treatment. Statistically significant differences in the patient and lesion complete clearance rates and adverse effect profiles were observed for the two light sources, Aktilite CL128 and PhotoDyn 750, at both time points of assessment. The patient and lesion complete clearance rates after illumination with the Aktilite CL128 were 96% and 99%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: BF-200 ALA is a very effective new formulation for the treatment of AK with PDT. Marked differences between the efficacies and adverse effects were observed for the different light sources used. Thus, PDT efficacy is dependent both on the drug and on the characteristics of the light source and the illumination conditions used. "
"OBJECTIVE: To develop recommendations for the use of methotrexate (MTX) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: Canadian rheumatologists who participated in the international 3e Initiative in Rheumatology (evidence, expertise, exchange) in 2007-2008 formulated 5 unique Canadian questions. A bibliographic team systematically reviewed the relevant literature on these 5 topics. An expert committee consisting of 26 rheumatologists from across Canada was convened, and a set of recommendations was proposed based on the results of systematic reviews combined with expert opinions using a nominal group consensus process. RESULTS: The 5 questions addressed drug interactions, predictors of response, strategies to reduce non-serious side effects, variables to assess clinical response, and incorporating patient preference into decision-making. The systematic review retrieved 93 pertinent articles; this evidence was presented to the expert committee during the interactive workshop. After extensive discussion and voting, a total of 9 recommendations were formulated: 2 on drug interactions, 1 on predictors of response, 2 on strategies to reduce non-serious side effects, 3 on variables to assess clinical response, and 1 on incorporating patient preferences into decision-making. The level of evidence and the strength of recommendations are reported. Agreement among panelists ranged from 85% to 100%. CONCLUSION: Nine recommendations pertaining to the use of MTX in daily practice were developed using an evidence-based approach followed by expert/physician consensus with high level of agreement. "
"BACKGROUND: Topical coal tar is a well known and effective treatment for psoriasis, but the messiness, staining, odor, and inconvenience associated with its use make patient satisfaction and compliance a challenge. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy, patient tolerability, and cosmetic acceptability of a new topical liquor carbonis distillate (LCD) 15% solution compared with calcipotriene (calcipotriol) cream in patients with moderate, chronic plaque psoriasis. STUDY DESIGN: A randomized, single-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, clinical trial consisting of a 12-week treatment phase and a 6-week post-treatment follow-up phase. SETTING: Outpatient dermatology research unit in an academic hospital. PATIENTS: Sixty adults with moderate, chronic plaque psoriasis (3-15% body surface area affected) not receiving other psoriasis therapies. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to apply either an LCD 15% solution (Psorent) or a commercially available calcipotriene 0.005% cream (Dovonex) to their psoriasis areas (excluding the head) twice daily at home for 12 weeks. ASSESSMENTS: A blinded investigator evaluated the patients' psoriasis using a modified Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) that excluded the head, and a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) scale at weeks 0 (baseline), 2, 4, 8, and 12 (end of treatment), and 18 (6 weeks after treatment was withdrawn). Patients assessed their psoriasis symptoms and quality of life and completed a cosmetic acceptability survey about their medication. OUTCOME MEASURES: The changes in the baseline PASI scores after 12 weeks of treatment were compared between LCD and calcipotriene groups. Additional comparisons were performed for success rates during treatment (PASI 75 and PASI 50), changes in PGA scores, patient-reported psoriasis symptom scores, patients' quality-of-life scores, and recurrence rates during post-treatment follow-up. RESULTS: Both treatment groups showed improvement in psoriasis severity and quality of life. However, the LCD group had greater mean reductions in PASI scores: 58% vs 37% in the calcipotriene group (p < 0.05) at week 12. Additionally, the LCD group had more patients (14/27) with absent or minimal psoriasis on the PGA scale than the calcipotriene group (6/28) by the end of treatment (p < 0.05). LCD-treated patients also maintained their improvement better than calcipotriene-treated patients through week 18 after treatment was withdrawn for 6 weeks. Both treatments were well tolerated and cosmetically acceptable to patients. CONCLUSION: The newly formulated LCD solution, applied twice daily at home for 12 weeks, was more effective and as well tolerated and cosmetically acceptable as the calcipotriene cream over 12 weeks of treatment and 6 weeks of follow-up. The LCD solution is a patient-accepted and effective corticosteroid-sparing treatment alternative for psoriasis patients. "
"Abstract: For a new anticancer drug carrier, we synthesized 4 compositions of amphiphilic stearic acidconjugated pullulan (SAP) and characterized them with FT-IR spectroscopy. Crystalline changes were verified by x-ray diffraction patterns before and after synthesis of the SAP conjugate. SAP nanoparticles were prepared by a diafiltration method, and the fluorescence spectroscopy using pyrene showed particle self-assembly in water. SAP nanoparticles were spherical in TEM photos, and particle size ranged between 200 approximately 500 nm in photon correlation spectroscopy. Release of all-trans-retinoic acid from the SAP nanoparticles was maintained over 5 weeks. For further study in vivo, we tested the cytotoxicity of SAP nanoparticles using an MTT assay, and cytotoxicity was augmented as the molar mass of stearic acid increased in human liver carcinoma HepG2 cells. Therefore, SAP nanoparticles might be a promising longterm delivery carrier for hydrophobic therapeutic molecules with the appropriate composition. "
"Abstract: The skin is considered a complex organ for drug delivery because of its structure. Drug delivery systems are designed for the controlled release of drugs through the skin into the systemic circulation, maintaining consistent efficacy and reducing the dose of the drugs and their related side effects. Transdermal drug delivery represents one of the most rapidly advancing areas of novel drug delivery. The excellent impervious nature of the skin is the greatest challenge that must be overcome for successful drug delivery. Today, polymers have been proven to be successful for long-term drug delivery applications as no single polymer can satisfy all of the requirements. Biopolymers in the field of dermal application are rare and the mechanisms that affect skin absorption are almost unknown. Biopolymers are widely used as drug delivery systems, but as such the use of biopolymers as drug delivery systems in dermatologic therapy is still in progress. Commonly used biopolymers include hydrocolloids, alginates, hydrogels, polyurethane, collagen, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), chitosan, proteins and peptides, pectin, siRNAs, and hyaluronic acid. These new and exciting methods for drug delivery are already increasing the number and quality of dermal and transdermal therapies. This article reviews current research on biopolymers and focuses on their potential as drug carriers, particularly in relation to the dermatologic aspects of their use. "
"Abstract: Topical dapsone gel 5% is indicated for the treatment of acne vulgaris and has been marketed since late 2008. The topical formulation retains the anti-inflammatory benefits of dapsone while minimizing the risk of toxicity associated with systemic exposure. This review summarizes the pharmacokinetic and safety data of topical dapsone gel 5% in acne patients, including those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, and provides support for dapsone usage in sulfonamide-allergic patients. Overall, topical dapsone gel has a favorable short- and long-term safety profile and has been shown to have no risk of hemolytic anemia, including in G6PD deficient patients. Although there are some structural similarities between dapsone and sulfonamides, dapsone is not a sulfonamide and cross-reaction with sulfonamides has not been demonstrated. "
"Abstract: Several generic cyclosporine (CsA) formulations have been developed over the last decade and are now widely available. In 2003 our local Health Department replaced Neoral with CicloHexal for the cost benefits, and we were compelled to convert all our renal transplant recipients to the generic CsA formulation. All renal transplant recipients were converted from Neoral to CicloHexal on a 1:1 dose basis in August/September 2003. Study 1 constitutes the retrospective review of all stable renal transplant patients and the CsA dose, CsA level and serum creatinine were noted. Study 2 constitutes the review of the records of de novo transplant patients inititated on CicloHexal compared to matched patients transplanted on Neoral before the conversion and the CsA dose, CsA level and serum creatinine noted (Study 2). There was no difference in the mean CsA dose, CsA level or serum creatinine at one month before conversion (on Neoral) compared to one month after conversion (on CicloHexal) in the 117 stable renal transplant recipients. Similarly, the mean CsA dose, CsA level and serum creatinine in de novo renal transplant recipients on Neoral (n=26) were similar to those on CicloHexal (n=23) at about seven and ten days postoperatively. In conclusion both stable and de novo renal transplant patients can be safely converted from Neoral to CicloHexal on a 1:1 dose basis. "
"BACKGROUND: The present study was undertaken to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a new microsphere adapalene formulation and conventional adapalene in adult patients with mild to moderate acne vulgaris. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, randomized, assessor-blind, multi-centric (3 centres) comparative, post-marketing phase IV study was undertaken in 175 patients with mild to moderate acne after approval by respective Institutional review boards. Patients fulfilling selection criteria were randomly assigned to either microsphere adapalene gel or conventional adapalene gel both once daily in the evening for 12 weeks after obtaining their informed consent. Efficacy variables included success rate and percent lesion reduction from baseline. Safety and tolerability was assessed on the basis of physical examination and monitoring of treatment-emergent adverse events. RESULTS: Of the 175 patients (88 in microsphere and 87 in conventional) 21 were lost to follow-up and considered drop-outs. There was a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in mean inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion and total lesion counts from 1st week onwards in both groups. A significantly lower number of microsphere treated patients (50%) reported a side effect (P < 0.05) as compared to 71.3% in conventional users. A highly significant decrease was observed in dryness and erythema (P < 0.01) in microsphere group compared to conventional. Eight patients in conventional group discontinued therapy due to severe irritation as compared to none in microsphere adapalene group. COMMENT: Therapy with microsphere adapalene provided a better tolerability with minimal irritation compared to conventional adapalene, without compromising efficacy and could be a better therapeutic option for acne.

"BACKGROUND: Dermatological procedures can result in disfiguring bruises that resolve slowly. OBJECTIVES: To assess the comparative utility of topical formulations in hastening the resolution of skin bruising. METHODS: Healthy volunteers, age range 21-65 years, were enrolled for this double (patient and rater) blinded randomized controlled trial. For each subject, four standard bruises of 7 mm diameter each were created on the bilateral upper inner arms, 5 cm apart, two per arm, using a 595-nm pulsed-dye laser (Vbeam; Candela Corp., Wayland, MA, U.S.A.). Randomization was used to assign one topical agent (5% vitamin K, 1% vitamin K and 0·3% retinol, 20% arnica, or white petrolatum) to exactly one bruise per subject, which was then treated under occlusion twice a day for 2 weeks. A dermatologist not involved with subject assignment rated bruises [visual analogue scale, 0 (least)-10 (most)] in standardized photographs immediately after bruise creation and at week 2. RESULTS: There was significant difference in the change in the rater bruising score associated with the four treatments (anova, P=0·016). Pairwise comparisons indicated that the mean improvement associated with 20% arnica was greater than with white petrolatum (P=0·003), and the improvement with arnica was greater than with the mixture of 1% vitamin K and 0·3% retinol (P=0·01). Improvement with arnica was not greater than with 5% vitamin K cream, however. CONCLUSIONS: Topical 20% arnica ointment may be able to reduce bruising more effectively than placebo and more effectively than low-concentration vitamin K formulations, such as 1% vitamin K with 0·3% retinol. "
"Abstract: Echinacea purpurea contains many beneficial constituents for protection of skin from oxidative stress and for improving hydration of skin. This study aimed to investigate the stability and dermatological efficacy of E. purpurea cream and gel. Echinacea purpurea extract was incorporated into suitable cream and gel bases. Stability of the extract in the formulations was investigated by determining its residual total phenolic content and antioxidant activity after storage at 4°C, 30°C and 40°C for 6 months. The effect of those formulations on skin irritation, hydration level and wrinkle reduction was evaluated in 10 healthy volunteers, aged 25-40 years. The shelf lives of E. purpurea cream and gel in terms of total phenolic content and antioxidant activity were only 2 and 4 months respectively at 4°C and could be extended up to 7 months by incorporation of α-tocopherol or disodium editate. The corneometer hydration indices increased up to 10.6 AU and 11.4 AU, and the wrinkles decreased 9.47% and 14.92% because of the application of E. purpurea cream and gel for 1 month. Both formulations showed no irritation to skin. Echinacea purpurea cream and gel developed in this study were effective in improving skin hydration and reducing wrinkle, but showed low storage stability. "
"Abstract: The aim of the research was to assess the bioequivalence between Rapidfilm, a new patented delivery system, versus the traditional orodispersible tablet (ODT). A randomized, two-way, single dose, crossover, bioequivalence study was conducted in 24 fasting, healthy volunteers with two formulations of ondansetron (Ondansetron Rapidfilm vs. Zofran Zydis Lingual ODT by GlaxoSmithKline GmbH & Co. KG). Plasma samples were analysed by a validated LC-MS/MS method during a collection period of 24 h post-dosing. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the targeted pharmacokinetic parameters did not show any significant difference between the two formulations and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) fell within the common acceptance range of 80-125%, satisfying the bioequivalence criteria. These results allow Rapidfilm to claim the same panel of indications of the conventional immediate release oral solid dosage forms, but offering several advantages also over the ODT: it can result in higher patient convenience for several applications.

"Abstract: The US Food and Drug Administration is in the process of formulating final rules for sunscreen labeling and testing. They have adopted a version of the solar simulator standard proposed by COLIPA, a European cosmetic products trade association. From our files we have selected spectral data on several solar simulators that comply with the proposed rules and have compared these sources both one to another and to several standard solar spectra of Air Mass 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0. In doing so we have used additional spectral analysis procedures including examining the goodness of fit between each solar simulator spectrum and an Air Mass 1.0 (0 degrees zenith angle) solar spectrum. The index of goodness of fit ranges from approximately 78% to just over 90% compared to solar spectra representing other Air Masses of 1.5 and 2.0, the goodness of fit is lower. Unfortunately, one may not assume that complying with a standard assures that other solar simulators also complying will produce identical results. In fact, by our analysis, none of the solar simulators we examined would be expected to produce the same SPF as sunlight. "
"Abstract: Since the nineteen fifties the attitude of the fair-skinned world population towards the sun has changed dramatically. Tanned skin, which before was regarded as the stigma of the underprivileged working classes, became fashionable and desirable. The science of photoprotection primarily focuses on ultraviolet exposure during leisure time activities, whereas ultraviolet radiation is still underestimated as a risk factor for UV-induced skin and eye problems. The actual discussion on the registration of UV-induced skin tumours as occupational diseases, however, has drawn more attention to this important issue. Ambient radiation, the working process itself and the photoprotective behaviour of an outdoor worker are the main factors which influence the actual UV exposure. However, the total risk for the development of actinic damage results from the interaction of both the occupational and the leisure time exposure. It is evident that there is a high need for photoprotective measures for outdoor workers. Topical sunscreens as a part of a comprehensive UV protection strategy for outdoor workers have to fulfil special requirements: reasonable price, high water resistance, non-sticky appearance. At present only a few products are available which meet these criteria. This is the reason why sunscreens are not so well accepted by outdoor workers. Great efforts have to be undertaken to improve sunscreen formulations and to convince people to apply them correctly and regularly. "
"Abstract: Based on the current weight of evidence of all available data, the risk for humans from the use of nano-structured titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) or zinc oxide (ZnO) currently used in cosmetic preparations or sunscreens is considered negligible. There is a large body of information that when viewed in its entirety is considered as sufficient to demonstrate that these nano-structured ultraviolet (UV) filters, irrespective of various treatments (coatings) or crystalline structure, can be regarded as safe for use at concentrations up to 25% in cosmetic products to protect the skin from harmful effects of solar UV radiation. ""Nano"" TiO(2) and ZnO formulated in topically applied sunscreen products exist as aggregates of primary particles ranging from 30-150 nm in size. These aggregates are bonded such that the force of sunscreen product application onto the skin would have no impact on their structure or result in the release of primary particles. Multiple studies have shown that under exaggerated test conditions neither nano-structured TiO(2) nor ZnO penetrates beyond the stratum corneum of skin. Further, the distribution and persistence of these nano-structured metal oxides is the same compared to larger pigment-grade (i.e., >100 nm) particles, demonstrating equivalence in the recognition and elimination of such material from the body. Finally, the in vitro genotoxic and photogenotoxic profiles of these nano-structured metal oxides are of no consequence to human health. Whereas the most logical, straightforward conclusion based on data from internationally-recognized guideline studies and current 20+ year history of human use is that nano-structured TiO(2) and ZnO are safe, there will continue to be questions as ""nano"" conjures images of technology gone awry. Despite this rather sober view, the public health benefits of sunscreens containing nano TiO(2) and/or ZnO outweigh human safety concerns for these UV filters. "
"Abstract: The magnitude and quality of UV protection provided by topical sun products have improved considerably over the past three decades. As our knowledge and understanding of sun protection requirements increases, product and testing technologies advance and new sunscreen molecules and technologies become available. The biannual London Sun Protection Conference has monitored this development over the last two decades. The 2009 edition of the conference (June 3 and 4) was entitled ""Perfection of Protection"". This paper, based on our talk given at the conference, tries to answer the question about the ""ideal sunscreen"" and explores four key requirements of good UV protection regarding where we stand on a ranking scale between poor and perfect, and what still needs to be done. Technology is leading with a rating of 80%, Assessment/measurement follows at 70%, Norms/standards around 50% and Compliance ranks only around 30% between poor and perfect. UV filters are the heart of the product technology. Besides UVB-filters, plenty of UV filters for UVA II and UVA I protection are now available in most parts of the world, except the USA. Although the Sun Protection Factor is well established and various methods have been developed for assessment of UVA protection, the performance measurement of sunscreens is still far from perfect. On the other hand, the high bar for achieving the highest UVA protection in the various classification systems released recently in Europe (2006) and the USA (2007) already helped to increase the protection considerably. The greatest problem however, remains poor compliance. Providing cosmetically pleasing formulations that people like to wear and communicating what sunscreens are and how they work are key elements in improving UV protection. "
"BACKGROUND: Topical agents containing mixtures of hydroquinone and glycolic acid often cause irritation in patients with melasma. OBJECTIVE: The authors assessed the safety and efficacy of a new cream containing hydroquinone (HQ), glycolic acid, and hyaluronic acid for epidermal melasma. METHODS: Fifteen Latin American women with bilateral epidermal melasma underwent twice-daily full face application with the study cream for 12 weeks. A moisturizer was added if irritation developed. RESULTS: Mexameter data revealed that 14 of 15 patients (93%) improved, and there was a significant decrease in MASI (melasma area and severity index) scores of 64% over the course of the study. Fifty-three percent of the patients required a moisturizer after eight weeks of treatment. The majority of adverse events were mild. Patient and physician global evaluation showed moderate, obvious or very marked improvement in all patients. LIMITATIONS: Open, uncontrolled trial in a small number of patients. CONCLUSION: A cream containing hydroquinone, glycolic acid and hyaluronic acid demonstrates improvement in patients with melasma. "
"BACKGROUND: Tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage, Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) is a synthetic retinoic acid receptor- betagamma topical retinoid approved for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and acne vulgaris. OBJECTIVES: To review a decade of experience using tazarotene as a monotherapy or as combination therapy for approved and other indications: acne, psoriasis, photoaging, basal cell carcinomas and various keratinization disorders. METHODS: We reviewed the published literature available on PubMed for safety and efficacy of topical tazarotene gel or cream preparations. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Tazarotene, in both gel and cream formulations, has been used both as monotherapy and as an adjuvant therapy. For psoriasis it has been combined with steroids, calcipotriene and phototherapy, and for acne, with antibiotics. Tazarotene has been shown to upregulate the tumor suppressor, tazarotene induced gene 3, which is overexpressed in psoriasis and skin cancer. Adverse effects are limited to mild to moderate local irritation and erythema as seen with the 'retinization period' of other topical retinoid therapies. Daily application of tazarotene is effective with sustained benefits and limited local side effects. "
"BACKGROUND: An occlusive patch formulation containing 10% methyl salicylate and 3% l-menthol was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of mild to moderate pain. Despite widespread use of counterirritants, including methyl salicylate and menthol, for topical pain relief, published efficacy and safety data regarding the use of the agents alone or in combination are limited. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety profile of a patch containing 10% methyl salicylate and 3% l-menthol compared with a placebo patch in adult patients with mild to moderate muscle strain. METHODS: Eligible patients were men or women aged >or=18 years with a clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate muscle strain. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 1 active patch or 1 placebo patch applied to the skin at the affected area (ie, shoulder, upper back, upper arm, neck, calf, thigh, forearm, abdomen). Pain intensity was assessed on a 100-mm visual analog scale while at rest and with movement for 12 hours after patch application. The primary efficacy end point was the summed pain intensity difference score through 8 hours (SPID8) with movement. Analyses included use of descriptive statistics and an ANOVA model. Safety data, including adverse events, and secondary efficacy end points were also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 208 patients (104 men, 104 women; age range, 18-78 years) were randomized to 1 of 2 study groups (105 in the active-patch group [mean age, 37.3 years], 103 in the placebo-patch group [mean age, 38.1 years]). The primary efficacy analysis (SPID8 with movement) indicated that patients receiving the active patch experienced significantly greater pain relief (approximately 40%) than those patients receiving a placebo patch (mean [SD], 182.6 [131.2] vs 130.1 [144.1]; P = 0.005). Analysis of the per-protocol population also found significantly more relief (P = 0.024) in the active-patch group (176.2 [131.4]; n = 92) versus the placebo-patch group (130.2 [144.0]; n = 96). Statistical analysis of secondary efficacy measures supported the primary end-point results. The number of patients experiencing any type of adverse event was comparable between study groups (active patch, 6.7% [7 events]; placebo patch, 5.8% [6 events]). No serious adverse events were reported during the study. CONCLUSION: A single, 8-hour application of a patch containing methyl salicylate and l-menthol provided significant relief of pain associated with mild to moderate muscle strain in these adult patients compared with patients receiving a placebo patch.

"Abstract: The cost of immunosuppression following transplantation can be reduced by using generic ciclosporin (for example, Equoral) rather than innovator ciclosporin drugs such as Neoral. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the interchangeability, safety, and tolerability of Equoral, a generic ciclosporin, with Neoral in stable adult renal transplant recipients. This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group clinical trial in stable renal transplant patients, comparing 6 months of treatment with Equoral with the same treatment period on Neoral. The primary end point was the between-treatment comparison of the total daily ciclosporin dose at the end of the study. A total of 99 patients were enrolled and constituted the full analysis/safety population, and 78 patients forming the per-protocol population were assessed for efficacy. Equoral was found to be equivalent to Neoral with regard to the primary end point of daily dose at the end of the study. This was supported by comparable serum ciclosporin levels at the end of the study. There were no renal transplant rejection incidents, but there was one death (in the Neoral group). Drug tolerability and incidence of adverse events were comparable between the treatment groups. In conclusion, Equoral and Neoral are interchangeable in stable renal transplant patients, and both drugs are associated with a similar safety and tolerability profile. "
"Abstract: Preservatives are used in ocular medications to prevent microbial contamination. The use of benzalkonium chloride (BAC), the most widely used preservative in ocular medications, has been scrutinized with a number of studies indicating its toxicity to monolayer cultures of corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the toxicity of BAC and other preservatives and common components of ocular formulations on monolayer and stratified air-lifted cultures of Chang conjunctival cells. Air-lifting Chang cells grown on transwell filters increased stratification as assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance and histology. Unlike monolayer cultures in which ocular medications containing BAC caused near complete loss of cell viability, stratified, air-lifted cultures were not affected by the presence of BAC in ocular medications with up to 30-min exposures. Stratification shifted the dose-response curve to the right for benzalkonium chloride, thimerosal, chlorhexidine digluconate, potassium sorbate and EDTA. These results demonstrate that stratification significantly affects cell viability of Chang conjunctival cells in response to preservatives and additives of ophthalmic preparations. "
"Abstract: The ocular structures are very sensitive to damage from ultraviolet (UV) radiation, exposure is linked to corneal and conjunctival damage, cataract formation and may also be implicated in the aetiology of age-related macular degeneration. These structures are usually protected by wearing suitable eyeglasses and goggles. An alternative to conventional eyeglasses/goggles is the concept of ""liquid sunglasses"" which involve the topical application of eye drops that are designed to block harmful UV radiation reaching the sensitive ocular surfaces. The evaluation of such compounds directly applied to the eye surface requires in situ measurements to compare the efficacy of different formulations. A novel ocular spectrometer system has been used to evaluate changes in the transmission of ultraviolet (UV) radiation through the anterior eye following topical application of candidate UV-absorbing formulations. The key feature of the system is the ability to propagate a beam of light tangentially through the anterior eye using a compact, hand-held lens assembly incorporating UV-transmitting optical fibres. A range of formulations containing UV-absorbing compounds were topically applied to ex vivo rabbit eyes. Significant increases in the absorption of the UV spectrum were detected in seven of the eight formulations studied, demonstrating the potential of this measurement technique in the evaluation of formulations developed as potential topical ocular sunscreens. "
"Abstract: Scalp lesions are common among patients with psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis and a number of other inflammatory and fungal conditions. Topical corticosteroids are a mainstay of treatment for many scalp dermatoses and they significantly reduce erythema, scaling and pruritus. Conventional corticosteroid formulations such as cream and ointments are often difficult or time consuming for patients to apply and may produce undesirable cosmetic effects. Medicated shampoos provide a more convenient alternative for patients who require topical administration of corticosteroids for scalp conditions. Tar shampoos have long been used to treat psoriasis and are effective for the long-term maintenance of remission in patients who respond to therapy. Antifungal shampoos are effective for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis and other mycotic conditions. A shampoo formulation containing fluocinolone acetonide, 0.01% is also approved for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. One superpotent corticosteroid shampoo (clobetasol propionate 0.05%; Clobex Shampoo) is approved in the United States (U.S.) for once-daily treatment of psoriasis of the scalp. The results of a 2007 pilot study also demonstrated that clobetasol propionate shampoo improved the signs and symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis. These findings suggest that high-potency corticosteroid shampoos may provide an important option for topical corticosteroid therapy in dermatologic conditions affecting the scalp. "
"UNLABELLED: Various therapeutic agents have been described for the treatment of alopecia areata (AA), but none are curative or preventive. The aim of AA treatment is to suppress the activity of the disease. The high rate of spontaneous remission and the paucity of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies make the evidence-based assessment of these therapies difficult. The second part of this two-part series on AA discusses treatment options in detail and suggests treatment plans according to specific disease presentation. It also reviews recently reported experimental treatment options and potential directions for future disease management. LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After completing this learning activity, participants should be able to compare the efficacy and safety of various treatment options, formulate a treatment plan tailored to individual patients, and recognize recently described treatments and potential therapeutic approaches. "
"Abstract: Hesperetin is one of the flavonoids and possess anti-inflammatory, UV-protecting and antioxidant effects. Permeation issues for topical delivery systems of such effects are occasionally problematic, and in view of the fact that microemulsions are potential carriers for transdermal delivery system, the objective of this study was to design an optimal microemulsion formulation by in vitro permeation study for hesperetin topical dosage form and determine its topical photoprotective effect and skin irritation by in vivo study. The hesperetin-loaded microemulsion showed an enhanced in vitro permeation compared to the aqueous and isopropyl myristate (IPM) suspension dosage form of hesperetin. In comparison, the effect of co-surfactant on the drug permeation capacity, propylene glycol showed highest permeation rate, followed by ethanol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol (PEG 400). Sunscreen agent padimate O, as a transdermal enhancer could increase the permeation rate of hesperetin. In case of in vivo study, the hesperetin-loaded microemulsion showed significant topical whitening effect and diminished skin irritation when compared with the non-treatment group, indicating that the hesperetin microemulsion could be used as an effective whitening agent. "
"Abstract: The combination of calcipotriol (Cp) and topical corticosteroids increases efficacy and reduces side effects as compared to monotherapies. Previous studies suggest that such combinations may have an added value with respect to reduction of T-cell subsets. A two-compound product consisting of Cp and betamethasone dipropionate (BD) has become available for the treatment of psoriasis and is clinically superior to both monotherapies. No immunohistochemical data are available on the in vivo effects of the two-compound formulation versus monotherapy with respect to the three key processes in psoriasis pathogenesis: epidermal proliferation, epidermal differentiation and inflammation. Therefore, 18 patients were treated with the two-compound product, Cp monotherapy or BD monotherapy for 6 weeks and biopsies were taken before and after 4 and 6 weeks of treatment. These biopsies were stained immunohistochemically and analysed (semi)quantitatively. All treatments decreased the number of Ki-67(+) cells and increased the keratin 15(+) staining. A more pronounced reduction of epidermal and dermal T-cell markers and human beta defensin-2 was seen following combination treatment, compared with both monotherapies. In conclusion, the investigated markers of the skin immune system and epidermal proliferation indicated an added value of the two-compound product over both monotherapies. "
"Abstract: The objective of this work was to verify if hydrophilic gels containing benzophenone-3 loaded nanocapsules (HG-NCBZ3) could improve the sunscreen in vitro effectiveness against UVA radiation and its photostability compared to a conventional hydrogel containing the free sunscreen (HG-BZ3). In parallel, the immune response of the nanostructured system was evaluated by mouse ear swelling test and the local lymph node assay. The nanocapsules were prepared by interfacial deposition of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) and characterized in terms of particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, drug content and encapsulation efficiency. HG-NCBZ3 UV scans showed higher absorption intensity values than HG-NCplacebo, prepared using unloaded nanocapsules. Films of the gels were irradiated with UVA light and the BZ3 recovery was evaluated by HPLC. BZ3 recovery decreased from 100% to 29% for HG-BZ3 and to 56% for HG-NCBZ3 after 13 h. After wavelength scans within 13 h, the relative areas under the curves (AUC) decreased from 1.00 to 0.62 for HG-BZ3 and remained constant for HG-NCBZ3. Sensitization assay showed that stimulation indexes lower than 3 for all the hydrogel samples. Formulations did not induce increases higher than 10% in ear swelling, indicating that the hydrogels did not cause cutaneous sensitization in mice. The nanoencapsulation improved both the photostability and the effectiveness of BZ3 compared to the non-encapsulated sunscreen and the topical application of free and nanoencapsulated BZ3 did not produce significant allergy response in mice.

"OBJECTIVES: The authors assessed the efficacy of a ceramide-dominant, triple-lipid barrier repair formulation (EpiCeram), which designed to correct the lipid-biochemical abnormalities in atopic dermatitis (AD) in comparison to fluticasone propionate cream. METHODS: In a five-center, investigator-blinded, randomized trial, EpiCeram was compared to fluticasone (Cutivate) cream in 121 patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Primary outcome measures were: 1) reduction in disease severity, assessed as SCORAD (Severity Scoring for Atopic Dermatitis) scores; 2) improvement in pruritus; and 3) improvements in sleep habits. RESULTS: EpiCeram reduced clinical disease severity, decreased pruritus and improved sleep habits both 14 and 28 days after initiation of therapy. Although the fluticasone-treated group showed significantly greater improvement at 14 days, SCORAD, pruritus and sleep habit scores for EpiCeram did not differ significantly from the fluticasone-treated group by 28 days. CONCLUSION: The ceramide-dominant, physiological-lipid based formulation could represent an effective stand-alone or ancillary therapy for many pediatric patients with AD. "
"Abstract: The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of 1,4-cyclohexanediol as a retardant on the percutaneous absorption and penetration of azelaic acid. Hairless rat skin was mounted on Franz diffusion cells and treated with topical formulations containing solubilized azelaic acid with and without 1,4-cyclohexanediol. The skin was separated into stratum corneum and the deeper skin layers. The azelaic acid collected in receptor medium and each layer at the end of each time point was extracted and quantified. A significant decrease in flux across the skin suggests a penetration retardation effect of 1,4-cyclohexanediol (42.50 microg/cm(2)/h in the presence of vs. 76.25 microg/cm(2)/h in the absence of) at active loading level of 1.13 mg/cm(2). The penetration retardation effect was also observed at higher active loading level (2.82 mg/cm(2)). Furthermore, presence of 1,4-cyclohexanediol in the topical formulation did not reduce the skin and epidermal retention of azelaic acid, suggesting its potential use in the development of superior topical formation for reducing potential systematic side effect while maintaining therapeutic efficiency. "
"Abstract: Patients with photodamaged skin need guidance in selecting treatment plans that optimize outcomes, minimize downtime, and reduce adverse effects. The gold standard among cosmeceuticals is the topical retinoids, such as tretinoin. A topical formulation of folic acid and creatine appears to be a viable treatment option for the treatment of photodamaged skin. The use of specific topical cosmeceuticals in combination with nonablative photorejuvenation is recommended in choosing modalities that address the concerns of the patient. A combination of intense pulsed light (IPL), low-intensity diode light, and biostimulating drugs has been shown to provide results superior to those of IPL alone for photorejuvenation. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is the treatment of choice for type C photodamage. Low-strength 5-ALA (1 to 2%) applied several times, every 10 to 15 minutes, and incubated for 30 to 60 minutes with 550 to 630 nm, 530 to 1200 nm, or 570 to 1200 nm light activation improved hyperpigmented lesions, skin smoothing, and skin elasticity with high patient satisfaction. The use of 0.5% liposome-encapsulated 5-ALA spraying has been shown to be an alternative to 20% 5-ALA in a cream base in patients undergoing photorejuvenation. Adipose-derived stem cells and their derived secretory factors may have potential as treatments of photodamage. "
"Abstract: The present study was conducted to assess the efficacy of a new mouthrinse formulation in reducing oral malodour compared to that of commercially available products containing chlorhexidine (CHX) and a negative control. 174 healthy volunteers, each with an organoleptic score of at least 2 and an H(2)S level as part of the volatile sulfur compounds (VSC) higher than 50 ppb, were divided into four groups. Participants were stratified according to their organoleptic ratings (OR). Group I: mouthrinse I (250 ppm F(-) from amine fluoride/stannous fluoride (ASF), 0.2% zinc lactate, oral malodour counteractives); group II: mouthrinse II (0.05% CHX, 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride, 0.14% zinc lactate); group III: mouthrinse III (0.12% CHX); group IV: tap water. All groups were instructed to perform standardized oral hygiene measures and to apply the respective test rinse twice daily after tooth brushing. Malodour was assessed by organoleptic measurement and by VSC levels at baseline, day 1, day 7, day 14 and day 21 into the study. To evaluate discolouration of the teeth, the colour was assessed at baseline and final visit. The ASF mouthrinse showed superior efficacy as compared to the negative control. A significant reduction in OR and VSC readings was achieved after single application as well as after 7 and 21 days of continuous use. Between test groups I-III no statistically significant differences were found at any time point. There was also a trend towards fewer side effects caused by the ASF product compared to the products containing CHX. The newly developed mouthrinse product significantly reduces oral malodour in patients with increased values both in OR and in VSC. "
"Abstract: A main cause for gastrointestinal (GI) complications in graft recipients is the routinely administered inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor mycophenolic acid (MPA). MPA is available in two formulations, the prodrug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and the enteric-coated sodium salt (EC-MPS). Clinical results point to a better GI tolerability of EC-MPS as compared to MMF. We performed an open surveillance study in 397 organ graft recipients to investigate the clinical tolerability of EC-MPS in renal graft recipients who were converted from MMF to EC-MPS (maintenance) or who received EC-MPS as a new component of their immunsuppressive regimen (de novo). Physicians recorded GI symptoms (nausea, emesis, anorexia, diarrhea, abdominal cramps) at the start of EC-MPS treatment (visit 1) and at the next two visits in the clinic (visits 2 and 3); general tolerability (very good/good/moderate/poor) was assessed at visit 2 and 3. Two hundred seventy-five patients were on maintenance treatment with MMF and were converted to equimolar doses of EC-MPS, and 122 patients received EC-MPS de novo. The mean time since transplantation was 4.2 +/- 4.4 years. Median time until visit 2 was 28 days and until visit 3, 65 days. In 63.0% of patients, tolerability was rated as very good at visit 2 and in 64.7% at visit 3. Most patients who had suffered from GI complications during preceding MMF treatment reported improvement or total disappearance of their symptoms after conversion to EC-MPS. In conclusion, EC-MPS is a useful means to reduce GI complications in MPA-treated patients. "
"Abstract: This article reviews various studies supporting the use of a fixed-combination monotherapy hydrating gel containing clindamycin 1% and benzoyl peroxide 5% (C/BPO), which is the only available formulation with a hydrating gel vehicle containing a humectant and an occlusive. The C/BPO hydrating gel provides a flexible and complementary efficacy and/or tolerability profile when used alone or with topical retinoids, which results in rapid response in inflammatory and noninflammatory acne. It also mitigates the irritation associated with disease flare or topical retinoid use, and reduces the postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) seen in women and in patients with skin of color with acne. These benefits are important because they have the potential to improve patient adherence to therapy and clinical outcomes. "
"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the formulation characteristics and pharmacodynamic activity of the lecithinized coal tar formulation (LCT) employing different methodologies and compare it with that of a conventional coal tar formulation (CCT) employing different methodologies. METHODS: Characterization for skin-staining was carried out employing shaved back skin of rats. Rheological properties were determined using Texture Analyzer. The dispersibility of the coal tar formulations in water was determined by macroscopic examination. Antipsoriatic pharmacodynamic activity of the formulations was evaluated employing mouse-tail model. RESULTS: The study revealed distinct superiority of the LCT vis-à-vis CCT. The LCT was found be nonstaining with no apparent adverse effect on rat skin. Rheological studies revealed significantly better spreadability and lower stickiness of the LCT than that of CCT. The LCT forms uniform dispersion with water, while the CCT tends to form large aggregates. Finally, the pharmacodynamic model demonstrated superior anti-psoriatic activity of the LCT. CONCLUSIONS: The findings with the LCT were highly encouraging, as it proved to be nonstaining to skin, easily applicable, and water dispersible with markedly improved efficacy. The product was thus potentially more patient-compliant and efficacious. The evaluation methodologies adopted during the studies were found to be accurate, simple, specific, and reproducible with immense potential for assuring the quality of coal tar product(s). "
"Abstract: We report a facile silica nanovehicle preparation procedure for hydrophobic drug delivery, which is carried out in water without adding any surfactant and additional catalyst. This strategy includes hydrophobic drug nanopaticle preparation by reprecipitation method and in situ hydrolyzation and polymerization to encapsulate this naoparticle using only N-(beta-amimoethyl)-gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (AETPS). To demonstrate this technique hypocrellin A (HA), a hydrophobic photosensitizing anticancer drug, is embedded into silica nanovehicle using this simple method. The resulting HA encapsulated nanovehicles (HANV) are monodisperse and stable in aqueous solution. Comparative studies with free HA and entrapped HA have demonstrated that the encapsulation effect on the embedded photosensitizer nanoparticle significantly enhances the efficacy of singlet oxygen generation and, thereby, the in vitro photodynamic efficacy. "
"Abstract: The nanosized titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2) is produced abundantly and used widely in the chemical, electrical/electronic and energy industries because of its special photovoltaic and photocatalytic activities. Past reports have shown that the nano-TiO2 can enter into the human body through different routes such as inhalation, ingestion, dermal penetration and injection. The effects of nano-TiO2 on different organs are currently being investigated and the concerns on its large scale applications such as sunscreen, etc. indeed become more interesting for us to investigate and to find the possible right answers for right doses for a safer application. In this research, the cytotoxicity of the nano-TiO2 was investigated in PC12 cells, a cell line used as a model in vitro for the brain neurons research. While the PC12 cells were treated with different concentrations of nano-TiO2 (1, 10, 50 and 100 microg/ml), the viability of cells was significantly decreased in the periods of 6, 12, 24 and 48 h, showing a significant dose effect and time-dependent manner. Meanwhile, the flow cytometric assay gave indication that the nano-TiO2 induced intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the apoptosis of PC12 cells with the increasing concentration of nano-TiO2. Interestingly, pretreatment of N-(mercaptopropionyl)-glycine (N-MPG), known as a type of ROS scavenger formulations, could somehow inhibit PC12 apoptosis induced by the nano-TiO2. These results might have revealed a key mechanism in PC12 apoptosis under the effect of the nano-TiO2 solutions. "
"Abstract: Rosacea is a common chronic inflammatory disorder of the facial skin characterized by periods of exacerbation, remission and possible progression. The principle subtypes include erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, papulopustular rosacea, phymatous rosacea and ocular rosacea. Although the pathogenesis is unknown, rosacea is largely recognized as an inflammatory disorder. Individual subtypes are likely a result of different pathogenic factors and respond best to different therapeutic regimens. The non-pharmacologic approach to therapy is adequate skin care, trigger avoidance and photoprotection; in addition, there are several topical, herbal, systemic and light based therapies available. Standard Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatments include topical sodium sulfacetamide, metronidazole, and azelaic acid. Anti-inflammatory dose doxycycline, a controlled-release 40 mg formulation offers a non-antibiotic, anti-inflammatory treatment option. Combination of azelaic acid or topical metronidazole with anti-inflammatory doxycycline appears to have a synergistic effect. Oral isotretinoin may be effective for phymatous rosacea and treatment resistant rosacea. Light based therapies with pulsed dye laser and intense pulsed light are effective in treatment of erythema and telangiectasias. As our knowledge of rosacea and its therapeutic options expand, a multifaceted approach to treatment is warranted. "
"Abstract: Topical corticosteroids are effective for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. The duration of treatment with mid- to high-potency formulations is limited by the well-known side effects associated with their long-term use; further, topical corticosteroids treat only the inflammation associated with the disease. This study assessed the antifungal activity of a new corticosteroid-free cream against Malassezia spp, which may be an important pathogenic factor in seborrheic dermatitis. This was a single-center, bilateral, open-label pilot study in 10 healthy volunteers. The nonsteroidal cream was applied twice daily to a designated target area on the chest for 7 days, and the number of colony-forming units of Malassezia spp taken by tape stripping after 7 days was compared with baseline. The percentage reduction from baseline to day 7 in the number of colony-forming units of Malassezia spp was 94% on the treated side versus 49% on the untreated side (P = .03). This pilot study shows the nonsteroidal topical cream has antifungal activities. Further exploration into its potential as a therapeutic alternative for seborrheic dermatitis is warranted. "
"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based recommendations for therapeutic decision making in childhood psoriasis are lacking. OBJECTIVES: We sought to systematically review all available literature concerning treatment efficacy and safety in childhood psoriasis and to propose a recommendation for topical and systemic treatment of childhood psoriasis. METHODS: Databases searched were PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trial Register. All studies reporting on efficacy and safety of all treatment options in childhood psoriasis were obtained and a level of evidence was determined. RESULTS: Literature search revealed 2649 studies, of which 64 studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of topical and systemic therapies given in childhood psoriasis are efficacious. Short-term side effects were usually mild; long-term side effects were not described. LIMITATIONS: Most conclusions formulated are not based on randomized controlled trials. CONCLUSIONS: A rough summary of the proposed algorithm is as follows: first, calcipotriene with/without topical corticosteroids, followed by dithranol. Methotrexate is considered to be the systemic treatment of choice. "
"BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been proposed as a treatment option for acne vulgaris. The authors have proposed in this work a liposomal delivery for methylene blue (MB) for selective acne treatment. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of liposomes loaded methylene blue (LMB) based photodynamic therapy in patients with mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris in a randomized, controlled and investigator blinded study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Liposomes loaded methylene blue (LMB) was prepared and studied for different pharmaceutical properties and formulated in hydrogel (MB 0.1%). Permeability and selective sebaceous gland targeting in mice skin was studied. Gel containing LMB was used for treating 13 patients complaining of mild-moderate acne vulgaris once a week for two weeks. Efficacy evaluation included changes in lesions counts, clinical assessments of clinical improvement by patients and evaluating dermatologists. Pain and local adverse effects were also evaluated. RESULTS: The mechanism of the drug released from liposomes (both in pH = 5.5 and in pH = 7.2) was following zero order kinetics with significant increase in the drug released in pH = 5.5. Drug released from free methylene blue (FMB) gel was significantly higher (P < 0.05) with Higuichi's diffusion model than LMB gel, which followed zero order kinetics. Free MB gel showed superficial destruction in the mice hair shaft while LMB showed complete destruction of pilosebaceous unit. After only two sessions, there was a 83.3% reduction in the number of inflammatory acne lesions and a 63.6% reduction in the number of non-inflammatory acne lesions. At 12 weeks, 90% of patients had a moderate-to-marked improvement of their acne in the treated areas. Most patients had no pain; also no serious adverse side effects were recorded. All the patients had no edema. Slight transient hyperpigmentation was seen only in three patients. CONCLUSION: Liposomal MB hydrogel selectively delivered MB to sebaceous gland and was effective in photodynamic treatment of mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris. "
"Abstract: The aim of this study was to develop nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) for topical delivery of fluticasone propionate (FP) with the aim to further improve the safety profile and decrease the adverse-side effects commonly reported in topical corticotherapy. NLC are colloidal drug-carriers consisting of a blend of a solid lipid and a small amount of liquid lipid since these carriers have proved to be effective in epidermal targeting in particular of glucocorticoids. NLC consisting of glyceryl palmito-stearate, and PEG-containing medium chain triglycerides mixture, stabilised by polysorbate 80 and soybean phosphatidylcholine were prepared. A mean particle size between 380 and 408 nm and entrapment efficacy of 95% were obtained for FP-loaded NLC. The crystallinity and polymorphic phase behaviour of FP-free and FP-loaded NLC were examined by differential scanning calorimetry and wide angle X-ray diffraction. Results revealed a low-crystalline structure and confirmed the incorporation of FP into the particles. The suitability of PEG-containing liquid lipids to form the lipid matrix of NLC was also confirmed. "
"BACKGROUND: Actinic keratoses (AKs) are common and may progress to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). While cryotherapy is the most commonly used treatment for AKs, it is only suitable for treating a few lesions at a time. Topical medications such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) allow for more generalized treatment of AKs in the setting of multiple lesions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and discuss clinical trials examining the efficacy of 5-FU cream formulations (0.5% and 5%), as 5% 5-FU has four times greater systemic absorption. METHODS: We conducted Pubmed and Embase searches (1965 to 13 April 2009) to find studies evaluating the efficacy of 5-FU cream monotherapy (0.5% and 5%) in treating multiple AKs of the face and scalp. We only included studies employing standard treatment regimens (as per the US FDA), with an endpoint of complete clearance. RESULTS: Nine studies met our criteria. At 4 weeks post-treatment, complete clearance rates of 0.5% and 5% 5-FU ranged from 16.7% to 57.8% and 43% to 100%, respectively. As the various studies employed different measurements of tolerability, we were unable to pool this data. In the only split-face study comparing both formulations, both treatments produced equivalent rates (43%) of complete clearance, but 5% 5-FU had higher rates of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Despite evidence suggesting the superior efficacy of 5% 5-FU over 0.5% 5-FU, high-powered clinical trials comparing both treatments are lacking. Furthermore, tolerability rates between formulations warrant further examination given the possible enhanced systemic absorption of 5% 5-FU over 0.5% 5-FU. Such studies will enable dermatologists to appropriately balance the risks and benefits of each respective treatment to provide optimal solutions to patients with multiple AKs. "
"Abstract: The calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) cyclosporine micro emulsion (CyA-ME) and tacrolimus (Tac) both display renal and vascular toxicities. We undertook a single-center retrospective study among 149 surviving liver transplant recipients. The primary outcome was kidney function over 10 years posttransplant, evaluating the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula with subsequent Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative staging. The secondary outcomes included correlations between CNI trough levels (C0), GFR, and items of cardiovascular toxicity. At 1 and 5 years, the mean GFRs were 74.2 and 76.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2) under Tac versus 62.8 and 66.0 mL/min/1.73 m(2) under CyA-ME (P < .001). The mean value in favor of Tac was + 10 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Distribution of GFR stages showed more Tac patients at stage 1 or 2 and more at stage 4 or 5 under CyA-ME. There was no significant correlation between CNI-C0 and GFR. Switches between CNI or to mycophenolate mofetil did not show any significant GFR improvement. Patients under CyA-ME displayed significantly higher blood pressures with 3 requiring dialysis versus none under Tac. In conclusion, we observed that liver transplant patients under Tac maintained significantly better renal function with less progression to dialysis as compared with CyA-ME, indicating a lower renal and vascular (lower BP) toxicity.

"Abstract: Retinol is a cosmetic ingredient that is structurally similar to all-trans-retinoic acid, which has been shown to be effective in the treatment of photodamage. Since skin keratinocytes are reported to metabolize retinol to retinoic acid, investigators have hypothesized that retinol may also be helpful in improving skin photodamage. In this eight-week, double-blind, split-face, randomized clinical study, a stabilized 0.1% retinol-containing moisturizer was tested (36 subjects) against the vehicle (28 subjects) in women with moderate facial photodamage. Each product was applied once daily to the designated half side of the face. Subjects were evaluated at baseline and after four and eight weeks of treatment using a 0-9 scale for photoaging parameters. The results showed that, after eight weeks, the retinol moisturizer was significantly more efficacious than the vehicle in improving lines and wrinkles, pigmentation, elasticity, firmness and overall photodamage. Many of these differences were significant at week 4, with a progressive improvement to week 8. This study demonstrates that a formulation containing stabilized retinol is safe and effective to ameliorate the appearance of photoaged skin. "
"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of a novel pimecrolimus-eluting stent in a porcine coronary model and in a phase I clinical trial. BACKGROUND: Rapamycin- and paclitaxel-eluting stents reduce the need for repeat intervention by limiting neointimal hyperplasia but might cause delayed healing, pre-disposing patients to late stent thrombosis. Because inflammation plays a key role in restenosis, pimecrolimus, an anti-inflammatory drug, might reduce restenosis without adversely affecting re-endothelialization. METHODS: We evaluated a novel polymeric pimecrolimus-eluting stent covered with a thin parylene C diffusion barrier in a porcine coronary model and in a phase I human clinical trial. The clinical study was a prospective, nonrandomized, first-in-human hypothesis-generating study that enrolled 15 patients who had a single de novo native coronary stenosis. RESULTS: At 28 days and 3 months in the porcine model, histopathologic indicators predicted safety and biocompatibility when stents coated with polymer only, drug only, and 2 drug-polymer formulations were compared with bare-metal stents (BMS). In the phase I clinical trial, 15 patients had successful implantation of pimecrolimus-eluting stents. By 6 months, no patient suffered death, myocardial infarction, or stent thrombosis. However, the angiographic restenosis (61%), mean late loss (1.44 mm), and repeat target lesion revascularization (53%) were significantly higher than historical BMS controls. Whereas the primary end point was percent volume obstruction, restenosis was so severe that operators performed intravascular ultrasound examination in only 6 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Pimecrolimus-eluting stents induced an exaggerated neointimal hyperplasia at 6 months in comparison with historical controls. "
"Abstract: Pharmacologic treatment options for osteoarthritis (OA) are diverse both in terms of mechanisms of action and delivery formulations; however, no single agent has been demonstrated to consistently offer both a high level of tolerability and a sustained degree of efficacy across a broad OA patient population. Ultimately, a multimodal approach to OA treatment is the best option, offering a greater likelihood of tolerability by avoiding sustained exposure to higher risk agents while improving efficacy by combining agents with more than one mechanism of action. Such an approach should take into consideration the compatibility of different pharmacologic therapies while also taking advantage of nonpharmacologic treatments. Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are both easily accessible to patients and generally effective for pain relief, are the most popular pharmacologic therapies used in OA; unfortunately, these agents are associated with gastrointestinal and other cardiovascular risks. Combining these agents with other treatments possessing differing side-effect profiles and mechanisms of action will likely reduce the safety and tolerability risk. The recent availability in the United States of a topical NSAID gel with less systemic exposure than oral NSAIDs may offer clinicians an additional means of achieving effective analgesia in OA of superficial joints while minimizing the risk of adverse events.

"OBJECTIVE: To determine the protection times provided by insect repellent and sunscreen in combined formulations against biting mosquitoes. To determine if concurrent use of repellent and sunscreen influenced protection times. METHODS: Insect repellent containing comparable concentrations of N, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET) with and without sunscreen were tested on human skin to determine the mean protection time (MPT) against Aedes aegypti (L.) in the laboratory. Further trials were undertaken to determine the effect on MPT of sunscreen reapplication over repellent every two hours. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the MPT provided by 80% DEET with (MPT+/-SE=770+/-54.8 minutes) and without (MPT+/-SE=830+/-20.2 minutes) sunscreen or 7.14% DEET with (MPT+/-SE =240+/-15.5 minutes) and 6.98% DEET without (MPT+/-SE =230+/-18.4 minutes) sunscreen. Reapplication of sunscreen resulted in a significantly lower MPT of a 17.0% DEET formulation when sunscreen was reapplied concurrently (MPT+/-SE=330+/-25.2 minutes), compared with DEET alone (MPT+/-SE =400+/-12.7 minutes). CONCLUSIONS: When combined in a single formulation with sunscreen, the MPT provided by both high and low concentrations of DEET is not reduced. However, if sunscreen is reapplied over insect repellent, protection times can be reduced significantly. IMPLICATIONS: In areas of endemic mosquito-borne disease, the reapplication of a low concentration repellent and sunscreen formulation may provide the most effective protection from biting mosquitoes while minimising the risk of overexposure to DEET.

"Abstract: Skin cancer is caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV) and the sun is the main source of this radiation. Sunscreens were initially formulated to prevent sunburns; laboratory studies later revealed that in rodents they could reduce UV-induced skin cancer which resembles human squamous cell carcinoma. Three randomized trials in older adults showed the ability of sunscreens to moderately reduce the occurrence of solar keratoses and of squamous cell carcinoma. However, no effect was observed for basal cell carcinoma. There is no animal model for human melanoma and observational studies often found sunscreen use associated with a higher risk of nevus, melanoma and basal cell carcinoma. These higher risks were found when sun exposure appeared to be intentional, that is, with the desire to acquire a tan, a healthy look or simply to spend as long as possible in the sun with as much skin exposed as possible. Three randomized trials showed that sunscreen use by sun sensitive subjects engaging in intentional sun exposure could increase the duration of exposure without decreasing sunburn occurrence. This increased duration could be the reason why melanoma risk is increased when sunscreen is used. Hence, sunscreen abuse may extend sun exposure duration thus allowing sun exposure behaviours that would not be possible otherwise. Advertising for sunscreens and labeling of sunscreen bottles should inform consumers of the carcinogenic hazards associated with sunscreen abuse. It would be good to use a personal UV dosimeter which would give an alert when one's individual sunburn threshold in the absence of sunscreen use is nearing. The combination of sunscreen and a UV dosimeter may be an option for reducing the melanoma risk among sun worshippers. "
"Abstract: Acne vulgaris is a common skin disorder that affects most individuals at some point in their lives. It may result in significant morbidity, including cutaneous scarring and psychological impairment. Current treatments include topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, topical and systemic antibiotics, and systemic isotretinoin. There are growing concerns of rising antibiotic resistance, significant side effects of isotretinoin therapy, and lack of safe and effective treatment for pregnant females. Recent advances in the pathogenesis of acne have led to a greater understanding of the underlying inflammatory mechanisms and the role the Propionibacterium acnes and biofilms. This has led to the development of new therapeutic targets. This article reviews emerging treatments of acne, including topical picolinic acid, topical antibiotic dapsone, systemic zinc salts, oral antibiotic lymecycline, new formulations of and synergistic combinations of benzoyl peroxide, photodynamic therapy with topical photosensitizers and potential acne vaccines.

"Abstract: The aim of this study was to determine the safety of azelaic acid (AA) and its derivatives in nanovesicles for pharmaceutical and cosmetic uses. The hydrophilic property of AA was modified by complexing AA with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (AACD). The lipophilic property of AA was improved to diethyl azelate (DA) by esterification with Fischer reaction. AA, AACD and DA were entrapped in liposomes and niosomes with the compositions of L-alpha-dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol = 7:3 and Tween 61/cholesterol = 1:1, respectively, by chloroform film method with sonication. The size of the vesicles ranged from 50 to 200 nm, indicating nanosize characteristics. The cytotoxicity of AA, AACD and DA entrapped nanovesicular formulations on mouse epidermal cell lines (JB6, normal cell lines) by the sulforhodamine B assay was modest when compared with cisplatin. Blank liposomes and niosomes gave no growth inhibitory effect. The irritation of AA, AACD and DA entrapped and not entrapped in nanovesicles on rabbit skin was examined according to the Environmental Protection Agency health effect test guidelines. The results showed no signs of erythema or edema within 72 h. AA and its derivatives were safe for topical use when entrapped in nanovesicles because of no toxicity to normal cell lines and no allergy on rabbit skin. "
"Abstract: A 3-step acne system has been developed to enhance the bioavailability and follicular penetration of benzoyl peroxide (BPO). Participants with mild to moderate facial acne vulgaris were randomly assigned to 10 weeks' facial treatment with the 3-step acne system (proprietary salicylic acid cleanser 2% twice daily, proprietary salicylic acid toner 2% once daily, and solubilized BPO gel 5% twice daily) or with control cleanser twice daily plus clindamycin 1%-BPO 5% gel (jar formulation) twice daily. Among 139 participants enrolled, the 3-step acne system was at least as effective as clindamycin-BPO in reducing noninflammatory lesion counts in the early weeks of treatment in the absence of an antibiotic (mean reductions were 27% vs 13%, 39% vs 25%, 40% vs 33%, and 42% vs 42% at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 10, respectively) (all not significant). Both regimens were associated with comparable reductions in inflammatory lesion counts at all time points. Both regimens also were generally well-tolerated with mean scores for erythema, dryness, peeling, burning/stinging, and itching less than mild in both groups at all time points. The 3-step acne system is at least as effective as clindamycin-BPO in reducing noninflammatory lesion counts in the early weeks of treatment in the absence of an antibiotic, which is likely attributed to the solubilized BPO formulation.

"Abstract: Capsicum fruit, a popular spice as chili pepper, is an important ingredient of the formulations used in traditional medicines. Moreover, Capsicum fruit is listed as an official drug in several pharmacopoeias. Capsaicin, the most abundant component in Capsicum fruit, exhibits its therapeutic and adverse effects in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, the known capsaicin content is the prerequisite for optimizing any formulation based on Capsicum fruit as a crude drug. We studied 16 samples of Capsicum fruits grown at different altitudes in Nepal and determined their capsaicin content by high-performance liquid chromatography. The capsaicin content was found to range from 2.19 to 19.73 mg/g of dry weight of Capsicum fruits. Capsaicin content in pericarp was found to be higher than in seeds. No correlation was found between the shape or size of the fruits and its capsaicin content. Our findings indicate that many of the formulations prepared from Capsicum fruit, even as described in pharmacopoeias, may vary in their strength, therapeutic activity, and possible side effects if the capsaicin content in Capsicum fruit is not standardized.

"Abstract: To date, emollients are included in skin care formulations although not much is known about their adsorption/deposition properties and/or the interactions of the constituents within these multi-component systems. The modulation of the adsorption/deposition via the use of specific surfactant and/or emollient systems could therefore help to increase performance and sensorial benefits as well as to reduce adverse effects. In this study, the effects of various tripartite systems consisting of sodium laureth sulphate (SLES), a co-surfactant and an emollient were studied. The two different emollients tested adsorbed with varying amounts although the same surfactant/co-surfactant system was used. Interestingly, the deposition of both SLES and/or the emollient is also substantially influenced by the emollient component itself as well as by the co-surfactant used. Sensory assessments showed that although SLES has a negative effect on the skin feel, adsorbed emollients improve skin softness and smoothness. These results show that optimization of performance is possible when using a co-surfactant best suited for the emollient. "
"INTRODUCTION: Calcineurin inhibitors are associated with chronic allograft nephropathy. Protocols to reverse nephrotoxicity incorporate dosage reduction or withdrawal of these agents. Using ketoconazole as a sparing agent with mean cyclosporine doses of less than 50 mg/d, we have usually observed adverse cosmetic effects. One cohort of patients exhibited severe gingival hyperplasia that required gum resection; some also had hypertricosis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of conversion from cyclosporine (CsA) to a tacrolimus generic formulation (TAC) in patients with adverse cosmetic effects from CsA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients were studied at a mean (SD) of 56 (48) months posttransplantation; serum creatinine concentration was 1.91 (0.68) mg/dL. All had eyebrow and facial hypertricosis, and 10 also had gum hyperplasia. Cyclosporine C0 or C2 levels and CsA dosage had previously been changed simultaneously with ketoconazole. The day after withdrawal of CsA, TAC therapy was started at a dose of 0.065 to 0.030 mg/kg/d. Patients were followed up for 18 months (12.76 [7.57]) with routine laboratory tests. RESULTS: Twenty patients without proteinuria demonstrated improved renal function at 1-month follow-up; serum creatinine concentration was 1.76 (0.42) mg/dL vs 1.47 (0.37) mg/dL (P < .02). Levels of tacrolimus were 13.82 (7.95) ng/mL at 15 days and 7.3 (3.5) ng/mL at 2 months after the dosage was decreased to 0.042 mg/kg/d. Gum hypertrophy and hypertrichosis resolved in all patients. One patient died 18 months after conversion of cardiovascular disease and chronic allograft nephropathy. Neither diabetes nor dislipidemia were noted. CONCLUSION: Generic TAC is a good therapeutic alternative in renal transplant recipients with adverse reactions to CsA. "
"Abstract: The present investigation aims at development of pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) based drug in adhesive type transdermal systems of ondansetron hydrochloride with higher permeation flux. The effect of mixture of two chemical permeation enhancers (oleic acid and lauric acid diethanolamide); and drug loading dose on the ex vivo human cadaver skin permeation from the transdermal patches has been investigated using a d-optimal combined mixture design. Incorporation of chemical permeation enhancers significantly improved the permeability parameters and it was also found that blend of permeation enhancers is more effective than either permeation enhancer. Criterion of desirability was employed to numerically optimize the transdermal system. Optimized formulation was achieved with 67.5% lauric acid diethanolamide, 32.5% oleic acid and 10% drug loading in an acrylate based PSA matrix. Optimized formulation was found to be nonirritating and safe for dermatological application. "
"Abstract: Cosmetic ingredients previously considered ""inert"" have potential to provide a biologic effect to skin. In a cosmeceutical formulation, the boundary between an ""active"" and ""inert"" ingredient may be obscured. For this reason, the cosmeceutical distributor must find a nonambiguous method to demonstrate the efficacy of a new ingredient. For a product to be successful in the marketplace, the benefits of the product must clearly be communicated to the consumer, and the consumer must be satisfied with product performance. "
"Abstract: Consumers will pay a premium for high-performance skin and hair care products. The demand exists, and in return for the high cost, consumers expect the product to perform as claimed and to meet aesthetic standards beyond many products found in the mass market. To be successful in this highly competitive market, products must function as claimed or consumers will not repurchase. Effective contemporary high-end products must be properly formulated in nonirritating vehicles that consumers will perceive as elegant. "
"Abstract: The cosmeceutical category is an undefined, unclassified, and unregulated area of dermatology that is yet in its infancy. Traditional cosmeceuticals involve the topical application of biologically active ingredients that affect the skin barrier and overall skin health. The ability of these ingredients to enhance skin functioning depends on how they are formulated into products that can maintain the integrity of the active ingredient, deliver it in a biologically active form to the skin, reach the target site in sufficient quantity to exert an effect, and properly release from the carrier vehicle. In the United States, cosmeceuticals are sold as cosmetics, making marketing, packaging, and aesthetic appeal important considerations. Ideally, the cosmeceutical should be clinically tested for efficacy to ensure a proven skin benefit and also to substantiate marketing claims. Governmental limitations of efficacy claims restrict cosmeceutical development because products can only be assessed in terms of their ability to improve skin appearance but not function. Improving function would remove the cosmeceutical from the cosmetic category and place it in the drug category. Herein lies the challenge of defining the cosmeceutical category. "
"BACKGROUND: There is increasing concern over the local and systemic side effects of TiO(2) and ZnO coated nanoparticles widely used in sun blockers. OBJECTIVE: To determine the localization and possible skin penetration of TiO(2) and ZnO nanoparticles, dispersed in 3 sunscreen formulations, under realistic in vivo conditions in normal and altered skin. METHODS: Nuclear microscopy techniques provided spatially resolved quantitative analysis of Ti and Zn nanoparticle distributions in transversal cryosections of skin obtained by biopsy with no further treatment. A test hydrophobic formulation containing coated 20-nm TiO(2) nanoparticles and 2 commercial sunscreen formulations containing TiO(2) alone or in combination with ZnO were tried, taking into account realistic use conditions by consumers and compared with the recommended standard condition for the sun protection factor test. The protocols consisted of an open test. RESULTS: Following a 2-hour exposure period of normal human skin to TiO(2)- and ZnO-containing sunscreens, detectable amounts of these physical blockers were only present at the skin surface and in the uppermost stratum corneum regions. Layers deeper than the stratum corneum were devoid of TiO(2) or exogenous ZnO, even after 48 h of exposure to the sunscreen, under occlusion. Deposition of TiO(2) and ZnO nanoparticles in the openings of the pilosebaceous follicles was also observed, suggesting a preferential fixation area. Penetration of nanoparticles into viable skin tissue could not be detected. CONCLUSIONS: TiO(2) or ZnO nanoparticles are absent or their levels are too low to be tested under the stratum corneum in human viable epidermal layers. Therefore, significant penetration towards the underlying keratinocytes is unlikely. "
"Abstract: Two photosensitizing systems: (1) tetrakis(4-hydroxyphenyl)porphyrin (p-THPP) encapsulated in sterically stabilized liposomes (SSL) and (2) p-THPP functionalized by covalent attachment of poly(ethylene glycol) (p-THPP-PEG(2000)) were studied in vitro. The dark and photo cytotoxicity of these systems were evaluated on two cell lines: HCT 116, a human colorectal carcinoma cell line, and DU 145, a prostate cancer cell line and compared with these determined for free p-THPP. It was demonstrated that both encapsulation in liposomes as well as attachment of PEG chain result in pronounced reduction of the dark cytotoxicity of the parent porphyrin. The liposomal formulation showed higher than p-THPP-PEG(2000) photocytotoxicity towards both cell lines used in the studies. "
"Abstract: Plaque-type psoriasis is a chronic and immune-mediated skin disease affecting approximately 1-3% of the Caucasian population. Most cases are of mild or moderate severity and benefit from local treatment that represents the mainstay therapy. Topical corticosteroids and vitamin D(3) analogues remain the option of choice. Optimization of these treatments is made by the combination of calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate. This formulation combines the keratinocyte differentiation and antiproliferative action of the vitamin D(3) analogues with the anti-inflammatory effect of steroids enhancing effectiveness while reducing the side-effect profile of the single topical agent. In this article, we highlight the advantages of the association of calcipotriene and betamethasone in the treatment of localized plaque-type, scalp and nail psoriasis. "
"Abstract: This safety assessment includes Ammonium and Glyceryl Thioglycolate and Thioglycolic Acid Butyl, Calcium, Ethanolamine, Ethyl, Isooctyl, Isopropyl, Magnesium, Methyl, Potassium, and Sodium Thioglycolate, as used in cosmetics. Thioglycolates penetrate skin and distribute to the kidneys, lungs, small intestine, and spleen; excretion is primarily in urine. Thioglycolates were slightly toxic in rat acute oral toxicity studies. Thioglycolates are minimal to severe ocular irritants. Thioglycolates can be skin irritants in animal and in vitro tests, and can be sensitizers. A no-observable-adverse-effect level for reproductive and developmental toxicity of 100 mg/kg per day was determined using rats. Thioglycolates were not mutagenic, and there was no evidence of carcinogenicity. Thioglycolates were skin irritants in some clinical tests. Clinically significant adverse reactions to these ingredients used in depilatories are not commonly seen, suggesting current products are formulated to be practically nonirritating under conditions of recommended use. Formulators should take steps necessary to assure that current practices are followed. "
"Abstract: This work aims to investigate the influence of the formation of ion pairing between all-trans retinoic acid (RA) and a lipophilic amine (stearylamine; STE) on the drug encapsulation efficiency (EE) and stability of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs). The SLNs were characterized for EE and size. The EE and particle size were significantly improved and reduced, respectively, when the surfactant or co-surfactant concentration increased. However, while the formulation without STE allowed only 13% of RA encapsulation, the EE for RA-STE-loaded SLNs was 94%. The stability studies showed a significant decrease in EE for the SLNs without STE, while, for SLNs loaded with RA and STE, the EE remained constant after 360 days. The interactions among ion pairing components and the lipid matrix were investigated through small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The SAXS analysis revealed the presence of RA in the crystalline form in SLNs without ion pairing, while crystalline RA was not observed in SLNs loaded with RA/amine. Skin irritation studies showed that the SLNs loaded with the ion pairing were significantly less irritating when compared to the marketed RA-cream. This novel SLN formulation represents a promising alternative for topical treatment of acne with RA. "
"Abstract: When liposomes are used as drug delivery systems, it is important that the therapeutic agent is efficiently and adequately encapsulated. In this study, cyclosporine A (CyA) was chosen as a model drug for two reasons. First, liposomes are a potential delivery system for CyA, as it has been shown that CyA has decreased side effects when encapsulated in liposomes. Secondly, if the aqueous solubility of a lipophilic drug can be increased, then it is possible to increase liposomal encapsulation by additionally loading the drug into the liposomes' aqueous compartments. Therefore, we investigated the use cyclodextrins (CDs) for complexing CyA to increase aqueous solubility as a strategy to increase liposomal loading. The effect of CyA loading on the liposomes' characteristics, stability and rigidity of the bilayer, and also the drug release profile were evaluated. Liposomes encapsulating CyA, liposomes containing CyA-CD complexes, and liposomes loaded with both plain drug and complex (double-loaded liposomes) were prepared. For evaluation of the effect of CD on bilayer rigidity and integrity, the permeability of the liposomal membrane in terms of carboxyfluorescein (CF) leakage was studied. Among liposomal formulations containing only CyA, 1, 2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC):cholesterol (CHOL) (1:1) and hydrogenated soybean phosphatidylcholine (HSPC):CHOL (1:1) formulations demonstrated maximum drug entrapments of 65.94 +/- 4.68% and 75.03 +/- 4.87%, respectively. There was no significant difference in encapsulation efficiencies between different liposomal formulations for those containing CyA-CD complexes (P > 0.05). Measurement of encapsulation efficiency showed that the amount of drug entrapped in the lipid bilayers was identical when prepared in the form of CyA inclusion complexes. Drug entrapment in double-loaded liposomes was increased by approximately 2-fold. The release profile of all liposomal formulations was biphasic, with an initial rapid phase during the first 5 h followed by a continuous and slower release thereafter. During the first 5 h, CyA used as the complex was released to a greater extent than free CyA. Leakage of CF from liposomes was affected by the inclusion of CD. The leakage rate was minimum for CyA liposomes and maximum for double-loaded (CyA and CyA-CD) liposomes. In conclusion, it is possible to encapsulate CyA both in the aqueous and lipidbilayers of liposomes if the aqueous solubility of CyA is increased by complexation with CD. Although entrapment of a higher amount of drug was achieved, the stability of the liposomes was compromised and should therefore be considered. "
"BACKGROUND: The efficacious acne treatment adapalene gel 0.1% is significantly less irritating than tretinoin of various concentrations and formulations, according to several clinical studies conducted predominantly in Caucasian patients. OBJECTIVES: To confirm the lower irritation potential of adapalene gel 0.1% compared to tretinoin gel 0.025% among volunteers of various ethnic origins and to explore the difference in the irritant susceptibility among ethnic groups. METHODS: The study was a single-centre, randomized, investigator-masked and intra-individual comparison. Healthy volunteers applied adapalene and tretinoin daily to the face for 21 days and to the forearms for 4 days, and were then evaluated for the level of irritation. RESULTS: The irritation potential of adapalene gel 0.1% was significantly lower than that of tretinoin gel 0.025% in all tolerability assessments, irrespective of the volunteers' ethnic origins. The between-treatment differences were similar among various ethnic groups. Statistically significant but small inter-ethnicity differences were observed in the evaluation of facial signs, with Caucasians being less susceptible than Chinese, Asian Indians and Malays. CONCLUSION: Adapalene gel 0.1% was significantly better tolerated than tretinoin gel 0.025% among various ethnic groups. The patients' ethnic origins had no impact on the difference between adapalene and tretinoin treatments in terms of tolerability. "
"Abstract: The toxic effects of nanoparticles (NPs) of ZnO and CuO to particle-ingesting model organism protozoa Tetrahymena thermophila were evaluated. Nano-ZnO was remarkably more toxic than nano-CuO (EC(50) values approximately 5mg metal/l versus 128mg metal/l). Toxic effect of CuO depended on particle size: nano-CuO was about 10-20 times more toxic than bulk CuO. However, when calculated on basis of bioavailable copper (quantified using recombinant Cu-sensor bacteria) the 4-h EC(50) values of nano- and bulk formulations were comparable (2.7 and 1.9mg bioavailable Cu/l, respectively), and statistically different from the EC(50) value of Cu(2+) (1.1mg/l). Differently from CuO particles, bulk and nanosized ZnO as well as Zn(2+) were of similar toxicity (4-h EC(50) values 3.7 and 3.9mg bioavailable Zn/l, respectively, and 4.9mg Zn(2+)/l). Thus, the toxic effect of both, CuO and ZnO (nano)particles to protozoa was caused by their solubilised fraction. The toxic effects of the copper compounds were not dependent on exposure time (4 and 24h), whereas the toxicity of zinc compounds was about 1.5 times lower after 24h of exposure than after 4h, probably due to adaptation. In summary, we recommend T. thermophila as a simple eukaryotic particle-ingesting model organism for the toxicity screening of NPs. For the high throughput testing we suggest to use the 4-h assay on microplates using ATP and/or propidium iodide for the evaluation of cell viability. "
"Abstract: Topical products commonly used to treat acne include retinoids and antimicrobials, due to their effects on different components of pathogenesis. Accordingly, a fixed combination of adapalene 0.1% and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) 2.5% was developed (Epiduo, Galderma) and was approved by the US FDA in December 2008 for the treatment of acne. The superior efficacy of this combination was demonstrated in 2 large randomized controlled trials. This paper reviews the evidence for efficacy and tolerability of the combination of the retinoid adapalene 0.1% and BPO 2.5%, a once-daily gel formulation for the treatment of acne. "
"Abstract: Fixed combination products of clindamycin 1% (as 1.2% clindamycin phosphate) and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) 5% are commonly used in the treatment of acne vulgaris. Although any given topical acne product may be therapeutically effective, signs and symptoms of cutaneous tolerability may lead to missed applications by the patient, thus limiting adherence to therapy. BPO and other formulation components such as surfactants, preservatives and high levels of organic solvents can cause cutaneous irritation and dryness. BPO irritation is dose-dependent. An approach to optimizing the BPO concentration was undertaken to develop a surfactant- and preservative-free, clindamycin and low concentration (<5%) BPO formulation. A 33% reduction in skin irritation was seen when the BPO concentration was halved from 5% to 2.5% (clindamycin-BPO 2.5% gel), maintaining a comparable amount of total BPO delivered to the skin. As a result, clindamycin-BPO 2.5% gel appears to provide efficacy comparable to that of higher concentration (5%) fixed clindamycin-BPO combination products and should optimize patient compliance as a result of the reduction in cutaneous tolerability reactions, including signs of skin irritation or dryness. Clinical studies have shown clindamycin-BPO 2.5% gel to be highly effective with the potential for a more favorable tolerability profile compared to products containing higher concentrations of BPO.

"BACKGROUND: Sunscreens have long been used to protect against the acute effects of UV radiation. They can also have protective effects on chronic UV-induced changes, such as photoaging and skin cancer. Recent studies have focused on marine organisms as a source of natural bioactive molecules and some UV-absorbing algal compounds are under investigation as candidates for new natural sunscreens. OBJECTIVE: The cutaneous photoprotective ability of the mycosporine-like aminoacids (MAAs) Porphyra-334 and shinorine (P-334+SH), high UV-absorbing compounds isolated from the red alga Porphyra rosengurttii, was evaluated by in vivo procedures in mouse skin. The expression of the heat shock protein HSP70 as a potential biomarker for acute UV damage was also investigated. METHODS: A galenic formulation containing the MAA combination of P-334+SH was applied topically to the dorsal skin of SkhR-1 H hairless mice, which were irradiated with a single UV radiation dose of 3.87Jcm(-2) and compared with a combination of UVB- and UVA-absorbing reference filters. Clinical signs of sunburn, such as erythema and edema, as well as other quantifiable histological and biochemical parameters, such as the expression of the heat shock protein 70 and antioxidant enzyme activities, were measured from skin biopsies at 6, 24, 48 and 72h post-radiation. RESULTS: The formulation containing MAA prevented sunburn cell formation, as well as corneum stratum, malphigian, dermal and hypodermal thickening and other structural and morphological alterations observed in biopsies of non-photoprotected skin. A significant increase in Hsp70 was observed in the epidermis of non-photoprotected mouse skin, besides a de novo expression in deeper layers. P-334+SH protected against the significant decrease in superoxide dismutase and catalase activities observed in non-photoprotected mice. CONCLUSION: The topical application of P-334+SH protected against UV-induced skin damage in mice and contributed to maintaining the antioxidant defence system of the skin as well as Hsp70 expression.

"Abstract: Among the emerging literature addressing the biological effects of nanoparticles, very little information exists, particularly on aquatic organisms, that evaluates nanoparticles in comparison to non-nanocounterparts. Therefore, the potential effects of nano-scale and non-nano-scale TiO(2) and ZnO on the water flea, Daphnia magna, were examined in 48-h acute toxicity tests using three different test media, several pigment formulations--including coated nanoparticles--and a variety of preparation steps. In addition, a 21-d chronic Daphnia reproduction study was performed using coated TiO(2) nanoparticles. Analytical ultracentrifugation analyses provided evidence that the nanoparticles were present in a wide range of differently sized aggregates in the tested dispersions. While no pronounced effects on D. magna were observed for nano-scale and non-nano-scale TiO(2) pigments in 19 of 25 acute (48-h) toxicity tests (EC50>100 mg L(-1)), six acute tests with both nano- and non-nano-scale TiO(2) pigments showed slight effects (EC10, 0.5-91.2 mg L(-1)). For the nano-scale and non-nano-scale ZnO pigments, the acute 48-h EC50 values were close to the 1 mg L(-1) level, which is within the reported range of zinc toxicity to Daphnia. In general, the toxicity in the acute tests was independent of particle size (non-nano-scale or nano-scale), coating of particles, aggregation of particles, the type of medium or the applied pre-treatment of the test dispersions. The chronic Daphnia test with coated TiO(2) nanoparticles demonstrated that reproduction was a more sensitive endpoint than adult mortality. After 21d, the NOEC for adult mortality was 30 mg L(-1) and the NOEC for offspring production was 3 mg L(-1). The 21-d EC10 and EC50 values for reproductive effects were 5 and 26.6 mg L(-1), respectively. This study demonstrates the utility of evaluating nanoparticle effects relative to non-nano-scale counterparts and presents the first report of chronic exposure to TiO(2) nanoparticles in D. magna.

"BACKGROUND: There has been some apprehension expressed in the scientific literature that nanometer-sized titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) and other nanoparticles, if able to penetrate the skin, may cause cytotoxicity. In light of a lack of data regarding dermal penetration of titanium dioxide from sunscreen formulations, the Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research initiated a study in collaboration with the National Center for Toxicology Research using minipigs to determine whether nanoscale TiO(2) in sunscreen products can penetrate intact skin. Four sunscreen products were manufactured. METHOD: The particle size distribution of three TiO(2) raw materials, a sunscreen blank (no TiO(2)) and three sunscreen formulations containing uncoated nanometer-sized TiO(2), coated nanometer-sized TiO(2) or sub-micron TiO(2) were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to determine whether the formulation process caused a change in the size distributions (e.g., agglomeration or deagglomeration) of the TiO(2). RESULTS: SEM and XRD of the formulated sunscreens containing nanometer TiO(2) show the TiO(2) particles to have the same size as that observed for the raw materials. This suggests that the formulation process did not affect the size or shape of the TiO(2) particles. CONCLUSION: Because of the resolution limit of optical microscopy, nanoparticles could not be accurately sized using LSCM, which allows for detection but not sizing of the particles. LSCM allows observation of dispersion profiles throughout the sample; therefore, LSCM can be used to verify that results observed from SEM experiments are not solely surface effects. "
"Abstract: A need exists for safe, effective therapy for the relief of the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (AR) that also consistently relieves nasal congestion, the most common and bothersome symptom. This study was performed to assess efficacy and safety of a once-daily tablet containing 10 mg of loratadine, an antihistamine, and 10 mg of montelukast, a leukotriene antagonist (SCH 445761) versus placebo and pseudoephedrine (PSE; 240 mg once-daily formulation; active comparator). In a multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized study, 1095 subjects with documented history of seasonal AR and positive skin-prick test to a prevailing aeroallergen were treated for 15 days with fixed-dose combination loratadine/montelukast (L/M), PSE, or placebo. After randomization, subjects rated severity of nasal congestion and measured peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) rate in the morning and evening. The change in quality of life from baseline was also assessed. L/M and PSE were significantly more effective than placebo in alleviating nighttime and daytime nasal congestion and improving PNIF rate, an objective measure of nasal obstruction. There were no significant differences between L/M and PSE for any efficacy analysis including improvement in the quality of life. Subjects treated with L/M experienced a similar incidence of total adverse events versus placebo and a lower incidence of total adverse events (including dizziness, insomnia, jitteriness, nausea, and dry mouth) versus PSE. Nasal decongestant activity of L/M was significantly higher than that of placebo and similar to that of PSE in symptomatic AR subjects. L/M showed a safety profile similar to placebo and was better tolerated than PSE. Thus, L/M offers a safe and efficacious alternative to PSE for the treatment of nasal congestion associated with AR.

"BACKGROUND: Despite a range of available topical and systemic therapies, treatment of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) can be challenging. Objectives. To evaluate the efficacy of a specially formulated preparation of tacrolimus 0.3% in clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment (TCPO) in the treatment of CLE. METHODS: Case notes of 13 patients with treatment-resistant CLE (11 discoid LE, 1 systemic LE and 1 subacute cutaneous LE) who had used twice-daily TCPO (TCPO group) were reviewed. These were compared with five similar patients with resistant CLE who had been given 0.1% tacrolimus ointment alone (TO group). RESULTS: In the TCPO group (mean treatment duration 20 months, range 1-72), a good or excellent response was seen in five and six patients, respectively; one patient showed slight improvement. Telangiectasia and acne were observed in two patients. No systemic side-effects were noted. In the TO group (mean treatment duration 6 months, range 1-24), one patient showed good improvement and two showed slight improvement. CONCLUSION: The results of our small retrospective study suggest that TCPO may be more effective than either 0.1% tacrolimus or clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment monotherapy in the treatment of recalcitrant CLE. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these preliminary findings. "
"Abstract: Combination therapy for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris using benzoyl peroxide (BPO) and an antibiotic is more efficacious and better tolerated than treatment with either component alone. Moreover, the addition of BPO to antibiotic therapy is recommended as a means of preventing the development of Propionibacterium acnes antibiotic resistance. However, BPO is an irritant, and the dryness and irritation experienced by some patients using topical therapy containing BPO can negatively impact compliance. Historically, once-daily treatment application has enhanced compliance versus twice daily. The current 12-week study aimed to compare the efficacy of a clindamycin 1%-BPO 5% topical gel with the hydrating excipients dimethicone and glycerin (C/BPO HE) and a clindamycin 1%-BPO 5% topical gel that does not contain hydrating excipients (C/BPO) applied once daily for the treatment of 20 participants with facial acne vulgaris and to determine if there were differences in product preference and participant acceptability between the treatments. Both C/BPO HE and C/BPO were effective in the treatment of acne, with substantive reductions (-60.8% and -61.3%, respectively) in total inflammatory lesions at week 4 in both treatment groups. Participants receiving C/BPO HE demonstrated a more consistent treatment response than with C/BPO, with incremental reductions in total inflammatory lesions at each time point, whereas the response to C/BPO waned at week 8. As a result, greater percentage reductions in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions were observed with C/BPO HE treatment than C/BPO treatment at week 8 (papules: -71.9% vs -49.4%, P=.053; pustules: -64.8% vs -28.0%, P=.134; open comedones: -44.5% vs 2.6%, P=.480; closed comedones: -35.5% vs -26.3%, P=.501). With the exception of papules, greater reductions in all lesion subtypes also were observed at week 12. None of the between-group differences reached statistical significance. Both treatment groups displayed similar disease signs and symptoms throughout the study period. However, scaling, erythema, dryness, and pruritus occurred more frequently in participants using C/BPO. Treatment satisfaction was greatest with C/BPO HE; participants reported that this formulation was easy to apply and 100% (9/9) of participants reported that they would continue using C/BPO HE compared with 80% (8/10) of participants using C/BPO. Both treatments were well-tolerated. In this pilot study, both formulations were effective in the treatment of inflammatory and noninflammatory acne lesions, but C/BPO HE produced a more consistent reduction in total inflammatory lesions over 12 weeks. The addition of hydrating excipients in the C/BPO HE formulation appears to improve patient tolerance and acceptance, which will likely help patients to comply with therapy. "
"BACKGROUND: A novel formulation of > or = 98% pure capsaicin (4975) is currently undergoing clinical investigation using novel routes of delivery to provide selective analgesia lasting weeks to months with a single dose. We conducted this study to assess the safety and effects of instilled and injected 4975 in rat models of wound healing osteotomy repair and sensory-motor nerve function. METHODS: Adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were used. To assess the effects of 4975 on nerve or muscle, 0.0083 or 0.025 mg 4975 or vehicle (25% polyethylene glycol-300) was applied to exposed sciatic nerve, or 0.1 mg 4975 or vehicle was injected into the surrounding muscle (Group 1). To assess the effect of 4975 on bone healing, an osteotomy was made in one femur and 0.5 mg of 4975 or vehicle was instilled into the site (Group 2). Behavioral testing was performed on both groups of rats and histological evaluation of the sciatic nerve, and surrounding soft tissue and bone was done at days 3, 14, and 28 after surgery. Femurs from osteotomy rats were assessed using peripheral quantitative computed tomography and biomechanical testing. Standard statistical tests were used to compare groups. RESULTS: Rats with direct application of 4975 to the sciatic nerve and surrounding muscle were no different from the controls in nociceptive sensory responses (F = 0.910, P = 0.454), grip strength (F = 0.550, P = 0.654), or histology of the muscle or sciatic nerve. In osteotomy rats, there were no statistical differences between 4975 and vehicle-treated rats for bone area (H = 2.858, P = 0.414), bone mineral content (F = 0.945, P = 0.425), or bone mineral density (F = 0.87, P = 0.462) and no difference in soft tissue healing. There were neither differences in bone stiffness (F = 1.369, P = 0.268) nor were there noticeable differences in the macro- or microscopic appearance of the right femur osteotomy healing site and surrounding soft tissues between the control group and the 4975-treated animals. CONCLUSION: A single, clinically relevant application of instilled or injected 4975 has no observable adverse effect on wound and bone healing after osteotomy or on the structural integrity of exposed muscle and nerve.

"UNLABELLED: Due to an increasing number of skin diseases as a result of exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, it is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of new skin care formulations with broad-spectrum sunscreens. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the status of nerve fibres in healthy human skin, to quantify effects of UV radiation on nerve endings, and to evaluate neuroprotective effects of new skin care formulations against UV exposure damage. METHODS: Samples were obtained from 34 female patients enrolled for plastic surgery and were immediately treated (10 min) with three emulsions: Cream 1, Cream 2 (placebo) and a sunscreen with sun protection factor 15 (SPF15). Control samples and those treated with the cream emulsions were exposed to UVA and UVB for 60 min. Nerve fibres were identified by immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody (anti-human CD56/NCAM). Cell damage was assessed by image analysis. RESULTS: Several cellular nervous structures were identified in the skin samples, including free nerve endings. UVA and UVB significantly decreased (40-60%) density of nerve endings in the control samples and those treated with placebo (Cream 2) or SPF15 (all P < 0.001). Cream 1 completely blocked effects of UV radiation on nerve endings (P > 0.05 vs. control). CONCLUSIONS: Quantification of cell damage induced by UV radiation provides useful information for identification of new skin care compounds with neuroprotective properties. "
"BACKGROUND: Oral dapsone has been available for over 60 years. Its first clinical use was discovered in 1945, when it was found to be efficacious in inhibiting the progression of leprosy. The combined antibacterial and anti-inflammatory pharmacologic activities of dapsone have made it a widely investigated drug, particularly for use in refractory and unusual dermatologic conditions. However, the possibility of significant hematological side effects, even at low doses, has limited its use. Currently, oral dapsone has FDA approval for the treatment of leprosy and dermatitis herpetiformis. The potential of oral dapsone to treat acne vulgaris is well established, but the risks of serious side effects have made it an undesirable drug for use in the relatively healthy acne population. Recently, a topical formulation of dapsone (Aczone, Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of acne vulgaris. OBJECTIVE/METHODS: The aims of this study were to review the published literature on dapsone pharmacology and pharmacokinetics, and to evaluate the gel's efficacy and safety in treating acne vulgaris, and finally to provide personal insight into its future as a topical agent for acne vulgaris. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Clinical studies indicate dapsone gel 5% is effective in treating mild to moderately severe acne. It is well tolerated, with pharmacokinetic evidence indicating topical dosing in comparison to oral administration significantly reduces systemic concentrations of the drug, and therefore risk of serious side effects. Data suggests that dapsone gel 5% has the potential to become an established topical drug for the treatment of acne vulgaris. However, studies comparing the clinical effectiveness of the dapsone gel 5% to other available topical antiacne drugs are needed as are studies accessing its usefulness and safety when combined with other acne pharmaceuticals.

"Abstract: Topical retinoids have been used in the treatment of pigmentary disorders such as melasma, actinic lentigines, and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. This article evaluates the clinical efficacy and tolerability of retinoid treatment for pigmentary disorders through an evidence-based approach. We searched the MEDLINE and The Cochrane Library databases using the keywords 'retinoid' combined with 'melasma,' 'lentigines,' or 'postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.' For each study, the methodology and outcomes were assessed according to specific criteria. There is fair evidence to support the use of topical tretinoin as a monotherapy in the treatment of melasma as well as in the treatment of lentigines (grade B). Adverse effects of topical retinoids are quite frequent, and include local skin irritation, erythema, and peeling, and their severity is mild to moderate. There is evidence to support the use of topical tretinoin in a fixed, triple-combination therapy (hydroquinone 4%/tretinoin 0.05%/fluocinolone acetonide 0.01%) for the treatment of melasma (grade B). There is poor evidence (grade C) to support the use of combination formulations for the treatment of lentigines, and large, randomized, double-blind, controlled trials are needed to further evaluate their use for this indication. In conclusion, there is evidence to support the use of topical retinoids as monotherapy or in combination with other topical agents in the treatment of pigmentary disorders. "
"Abstract: Dapsone, a synthetic sulfone that has been available for over 60 years, has been used to treat a myriad of cutaneous disorders. Prior to the general acceptance of isotretinoin, oral dapsone had been reported to be effective in the treatment of nodulocystic acne. However, the potential for systemic toxicity prevented its widespread adoption in the treatment of acne. For many years scientists explored the possibility of developing a topical formulation of dapsone for the treatment of acne in the hope of minimizing the adverse hematologic effects of oral dapsone. Such a formulation had been unavailable until recently. Dapsone 5% gel (Aczone) was recently developed to treat acne vulgaris. This topical formulation was approved in the US based on two randomized, vehicle-controlled studies. A 12-month, open-label study was also conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of topical dapsone over the long term. Finally, two open-label phase I pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to evaluate the systemic absorption of topical dapsone compared with oral dapsone. This article reports the results of these studies, which show a reduction in acne lesion count comparable to those observed in clinical trials of other approved topical acne therapies. With regard to safety, the studies demonstrated that the concentrations of dapsone and N-acetyl dapsone remain low and do not accumulate over time once steady state is reached. Of the total of 50 patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in all the studies, only two experienced a drop in hemoglobin levels, and those shifts in values were consistent with fluctuations observed for other study participants. A recent study evaluating the risk of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency found topical dapsone 5% gel to be safe to use in this patient population. Based on the observations noted in the above-mentioned studies, we conclude that topical dapsone 5% gel is safe and effective in the treatment of acne vulgaris. "
"Abstract: The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxic effect of nanosized ZnO, CuO and TiO(2) to Saccharomyces cerevisiae - a widely used unicellular eukaryotic model organisms in molecular and cell biology. The effect of metal oxide nanoparticles, their bulk forms and respective ionic forms were compared. The bioavailable Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) ions in the growth medium were quantified by recombinant microbial sensors. Nano and bulk TiO(2) were not toxic even at 20000 mg/l. Both, nano and bulk ZnO were of comparable toxicity (8-h EC(50) 121-134 mg ZnO/l and 24-h EC(50) 131-158 mg/l). The toxicity was explained by soluble Zn-ions as proved by the microbial sensor. However, nano CuO was about 60-fold more toxic than bulk CuO: 8-h EC(50) were 20.7 and 1297 mg CuO/l and 24-h EC(50) were 13.4 and 873 mg/l, respectively. The increase in toxicity of both CuO formulations at 24th hour of growth was due to the increased dissolution of copper ions from CuO over time. Comparison of EC(50) values of nano CuO, bulk CuO and Cu(2+) with bioavailable copper concentrations in the growth medium showed that the solubilized Cu-ions explained only about 50% of the toxicity of both, nano and bulk CuO. To our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the toxicity of ZnO, CuO and TiO(2) nanoparticles to S.cerevisiae. "
"Abstract: Reconstructed human epidermis models (RHE) constitute an innovative alternative to study phototoxicity and photoprotection in the cosmetic industry. However, little information is currently available concerning the harmful effects of solar-simulated radiation (SSR) in these in vitro skin models. In this study, the phototoxic effects of a single acute SSR dose of 275 kJ m(-2) were evaluated in a validated RHE model (from SkinEthic), and were compared with those obtained from an ex vivo skin organ culture recently developed from domestic pig ears. The RHE model was well differentiated in vitro and released a significant level of the cytosolic enzymes lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and extracellular signal-related kinase 2 (ERK2) protein in the culture medium 24 h after SSR exposure. The SSR-induced cytotoxicity was related to the formation of sunburn cells and the appearance of DNA damage (thymine dimer and DNA fragmentation) in keratinocytes. Interestingly, these DNA alterations were associated with the activation of the caspase-3 protease, mainly in the basal layers of the epidermis. In addition, the RHE model responses were comparable with porcine skin following solar irradiation, and none of the above cellular responses was observed in non-irradiated skin models. Finally, topical application of a broad-spectrum UVB + A sunscreen formulation efficiently protected both the RHE and pig skin against the deleterious effects of SSR. Thus, both RHE and ex vivo pig skin organ culture models are complementary tools in the assessment of SSR-induced DNA damage and apoptosis, and they may be used to evaluate the photoprotective capacity of cosmetic formulations.

"Abstract: In this work two types of pheophorbide-HSA (Pheo-HSA) nanoparticles, PHSA40 and PHSA100, were prepared and their photophysical and photosensitizing properties were investigated. Due to intramolecular interactions the singlet oxygen quantum yield of PHSA40 and PHSA100 is very low (less than 0.1). Intracellular uptake and phototoxicity of pheophorbide a as well as of the Pheo-HSA nanoparticles were studied in Jurkat cells. The HSA nanoparticles do not influence the amount of dye accumulation in cells. After 24h incubation, PHSA40 and PHSA100 showed a higher phototoxicity than Pheo. The reason for this behavior is an efficient nanoparticle decomposition in the cellular lysosomes. The process of drug release during incubation of cells with Pheo-HSA nanoparticles was illustrated by fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The final phototoxicity of Pheo-HSA is at the same scale as induced by free Pheo. The drug release ability of HSA nanoparticles shows the possibility to use such formulations as drug carriers in PDT treatment. Therefore, this work constructs a standard for further investigation and optimization of photosensitizer-HSA drug carrier system. "
"BACKGROUND: Retinoids are photoreactive molecules found in skin and retinal tissue. The use of retinoids in pharmacologic doses, applied topically, raises the potential of phototoxicities. Recent review articles and current US drug labeling indicate that tretinoin is a phototoxin. In developing a new formulation of topical all-trans-retinoic acid (tretinoin), formal testing of dermal photoreactions was therefore undertaken. METHODS: Four prospective, randomized, and controlled trials were carried out in healthy volunteers at two independent research facilities. Two trials examined phototoxicity following 24 h of drug exposure under occlusion (combined n=51), and two examined photoallergenicity following a 3-week, six dose induction phase (combined n=72) followed by challenge. RESULTS: No phototoxic or photoallergic reactions occurred with tretinoin 0.05% in a new gel formulation. CONCLUSION: The findings in these studies are consistent with previous studies of tretinoin in various formulations, and support the conclusion that tretinoin appears to be neither phototoxic nor photoallergenic in vivo. "
"BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis obliterans is the most important long-term sequelae of lung transplantation limiting survival. Optimized immunosuppression, including inhalation of cyclosporine A (CsA), may be a promising approach to overcome this problem. METHODS: In this study a liposomal CsA solution was characterized in vitro, doses of 10 and 20 mg were inhaled with the PARI eFlow inhaler by 12 stable lung transplant recipients, and lung deposition was evaluated by gamma scintigraphy. RESULTS: Inhalation of CsA leads to lung deposition of 40 +/- 6% (10 mg) and 33 +/- 7% (20 mg), respectively. This deposition resulted in a peripheral lung dose of 2.0 +/- 0.4 mg (10 mg) and 3.4 +/- 0.8 mg (20 mg), respectively. Extrathoracic deposition was 16 +/- 6% (10 mg) and 14 +/- 4% (20 mg), respectively, and the total deposition was calculated with 56% (10 mg) and 46% (20 mg). Lung deposition and peripheral lung deposition increased significantly with treatment time. The maximum CsA blood concentration and the area under the time course of blood concentration correlated with peripheral lung deposition. There were no statistically significant differences between patients with single- and double-lung transplantation. Inhalation of the study medication was well tolerated, and led to only minor but statistically significant changes in lung function parameters (FEV(1): -0.07 L; FVC: -0.09 L; sRaw: +0.35 kPa s.). CONCLUSIONS: The new liposomal CsA PARI formulation can be deposited to the peripheral lung using the PARI eFlow nebulizer. The treatment was well tolerated, and no drug-related side effects were observed. Once or twice daily dosing of 10 mg CsA A PARI would result in a sufficient peripheral lung deposition of approximately 14 and 28 mg/week, respectively. "
"Abstract: With extensive use of metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) in a variety of applications comes a higher potential of release into aquatic environments. NPs tend to form much larger aggregates in water, which are expected to settle down to the bottom of the water column and possibly get mixed with the sediments. However, little is known about the environmental impacts and biological effects of these aggregated NPs in the sediment column. In this study, we examined the sedimentation of nanoscale ZnO particles (nZnO) in zebrafish culture medium, and assessed the toxicity of settled nZnO aggregates on developing zebrafish embryos and larvae. Given the known dissolution of nZnO particles to release Zn(2+), we also assessed the toxic effect of soluble Zn(2+) in this organism. We demonstrated that within 48 h, micron-sized nZnO aggregates were formed and settled out of the culture medium. These aggregates were found to exert dose-dependent toxicity to zebrafish embryos and larvae, reducing the hatching rate and causing pericardial edema. The observed toxicity of the nZnO aggregates was not likely a result solely of particle dissolution, as soluble Zn(2+) alone caused much less toxicity to zebrafish embryos than nZnO. Instead, the combination of both nZnO and Zn(2+) may contribute to the embryonic toxicity, possibly by increasing reactive oxidative species (ROS) and/or compromising the cellular oxidative stress response. Interestingly, we demonstrated that one type of formulated sediments could mitigate the toxicity of nZnO aggregates, highlighting a possible countermeasure to reduce the adverse impact of nZnO aggregates on the environment.

"BACKGROUND: alpha-Hydroxy acids (alphaHAs) are reported to reduce signs of aging in the skin and are widely used cosmetic ingredients. Several studies suggest that alphaHA can increase the sensitivity of skin to ultraviolet radiation. More recently, beta-hydroxy acids (betaHAs), or combinations of alphaHA and betaHA have also been incorporated into antiaging skin care products. Concerns have also arisen about increased sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation following use of skin care products containing beta-HA. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether topical treatment with glycolic acid, a representative alphaHA, or with salicylic acid, a betaHA, modifies the short-term effects of solar simulated radiation (SSR) in human skin. METHODS: Fourteen subjects participated in this study. Three of the four test sites on the mid-back of each subject were treated daily Monday-Friday, for a total of 3.5 weeks, with glycolic acid (10%), salicylic acid (2%), or vehicle (control). The fourth site received no treatment. After the last treatment, each site was exposed to SSR, and shave biopsies from all four sites were obtained. The endpoints evaluated in this study were erythema (assessed visually and instrumentally), DNA damage and sunburn cell formation. RESULTS: Treatment with glycolic acid resulted in increased sensitivity of human skin to SSR, measured as an increase in erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation. Salicylic acid did not produce significant changes in any of these biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term topical application of glycolic acid in a cosmetic formulation increased the sensitivity of human skin to SSR, while a comparable treatment with salicylic acid did not. "
"Abstract: UVA exposure induces DNA damage that could result in skin carcinogenesis. Antioxidants are usually employed as protective agents to avoid this problem: in particular, both beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol can protect the skin against UVA-induced damage. It is well known that the photochemical instability of these compounds has been a limiting factor for their applications to protect skin. In this study, stearyl ferulate-based solid lipid nanoparticles (SF-SLNs), as vehicles for beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol, were formulated to improve the stability of these compounds. The SF-SLNs were characterized for entrapment efficiency, size and shape together with their cytotoxicity and capability to inhibit lipid peroxidation. After treatment with a pro-oxidant and/or exposition to sunlight the antioxidants entrapped in SF-SLNs were extremely stable. The results highlighted how SF-SLNs represent a suitable vehicle for beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol stabilizing and protecting them from degradation. A dermatological formulation in order to prevent skin damages is, therefore, suggested. "
"Abstract: Cyclosporine A (CsA) has been clinically used as immunosuppressant, and new application for airway inflammation was also proposed. However, the clinical use of CsA was limited due to severe adverse effects after systemic exposure and the poor solubility. In the present investigation, novel respirable powder (RP) of CsA was developed for pulmonary administration with use of solid dispersion of wet-milled CsA (WM/CsA), and the physicochemical and pharmacological properties of the WM/CsA and its RP formulation were characterized. CsA in the solid dispersion was found to be amorphous by X-ray powder diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry. It exhibited the improved dissolution behavior as compared to active pharmaceutical ingredients. Laser diffraction and cascade impactor analysis of newly developed WM/CsA-RP, consisting of jet-milled WM/CsA and lactose carriers, suggested high dispersion and deposition in the respiratory organs with the emitted dose and the fine particle fraction of 96 and 54%, respectively. Intratracheal administration of WM/CsA-RP (100 microg CsA) in experimental inflammatory rats led to 71 and 85% reduction of granulocyte recruitment in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and lung tissues, respectively, with showing ca 10(2)-fold reduced AUC and C(max) values of plasma CsA as compared to the oral dosage form of CsA at toxic concentration (10 mg/kg). Upon these findings, WM/CsA-RP would be efficacious dosage form for clinical treatment of airway inflammations with minimal systemic side effects. "
"AIM: This paper is a report of a review conducted to describe the current evidence about the prevention and treatment of incontinence-associated dermatitis and to formulate recommendations for clinical practice and research. BACKGROUND: Incontinence-associated dermatitis is a common problem in patients with incontinence. It is a daily challenge for healthcare professionals to maintain a healthy skin in patients with incontinence. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, reference lists and conference proceedings were explored up to September 2008. REVIEW METHODS: Publications were included if they reported research on the prevention and treatment of incontinence-associated dermatitis. As little consensus about terminology was found, a very sensitive filter was developed. Study design was not used as a selection criterion due to the explorative character of the review and the scarce literature. RESULTS: Thirty-six publications, dealing with 25 different studies, were included. The implementation of a structured perineal skin care programme including skin cleansing and the use of a moisturizer is suggested. A skin protectant is recommended for patients considered at risk of incontinence-associated dermatitis development. Perineal skin cleansers are preferable to using water and soap. Skin care is suggested after each incontinence episode, particularly if faeces are present. The quality of methods in the included studies was low. CONCLUSIONS: Incontinence-associated dermatitis can be prevented and healed with timely and appropriate skin cleansing and skin protection. Prevention and treatment should also focus on a proper use of incontinence containment materials. Further research is required to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of various interventions. "
"Abstract: Uvinul T 150, a UVB absorber, was administered (concentration 5%) in a vehicle to the skin of hairless albino mice before ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure for 5 days per week in a photocarcinogenicity study. Uvinul T 150 prolonged the latency period to 50% skin tumor incidence (controls: 21-22 weeks; Uvinul T 150: 36 weeks in males and 31 weeks in females). When Uvinul T 150 was applied in an alternating-exposure procedure (3 days/week before and 2 days/week after UVR), the inhibition of photocarcinogenesis was less marked (latency period 28-30 weeks). The vehicle formulation had no effect (latency period 20-21 weeks). The sensitivity of the test system was demonstrated by a positive control (8-methoxy-psoralene). Although UVB absorption was shown to inhibit photocarcinogenesis, the results also suggest that UVA radiation makes a contribution to skin tumor formation. "
"BACKGROUND: Newer agents and formulations seek to improve the tolerability of topical retinoid therapy. Recently, a gel containing crystalline clindamycin 1.2% and tretinoin 0.025% (CLIN/RA) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of treating mild-to-moderate acne. OBJECTIVE: This single-center, randomized, evaluator-blind phase 1 study compared the tolerability of CLIN/RA to 0.1% tretinoin gel or 0.1% adapalene gel. RESULTS: Forty-five patients applied CLIN/RA once daily to one side of their face every day for 21 days. Patients were randomized to either tretinoin 0.1% (n = 23) or adapalene 0.1% (n = 22) on the contralateral side. A clinical evaluator assessed degree of erythema and scaling; patients provided subjective evaluations of burning, stinging, and itching. CONCLUSION: CLIN/RA was significantly better tolerated than was 0.1% tretinoin gel, as evidenced by significantly reduced erythema (P < 0.04), scaling (P < 0.03), itching (P < 0.02), burning (P < 0.03) and stinging (P < 0.04). A trend for greater erythema, scaling, and subjective discomfort for 0.1% adapalene gel compared to CLIN/RA was also evident. "
"BACKGROUND: Niacin lowers levels of atherogenic apolipoprotein-B-containing lipoproteins, including lipoprotein(a), and raises levels of atheroprotective high-density lipoproteins. However, cutaneous flushing has been a major impediment to the clinical use of niacin. OBJECTIVE: Extended-release niacin (niacin ER) is a once-daily prescription niacin formulated to limit flushing. An analysis of flushing events with niacin ER should facilitate its clinical use. METHODS: The analysis pools previously unpublished data on flushing and related side effects from four randomized, double-blind studies of niacin ER, and also reviews long-term data on flushing from a 96-week open label, uncontrolled study. RESULTS: Among 333 patients treated with niacin ER (once daily at bedtime) for 3 to 6 months, 83% reported at least one flushing episode, compared to 18% of patients treated with placebo or gemfibrozil. Approximately 50% had ≤5 flushing events, and only 5% reported >20 flushing events. The majority (76%) of patients treated with niacin ER rated flushing events as mild to moderate in intensity; 6% of patients withdrew due to flushing. In an 8-week comparison of niacin ER once daily at bedtime with immediate-release niacin three times daily at equivalent total daily doses, the total number of flushing events was 76% lower in the niacin ER group. CONCLUSION: Niacin ER can help control flushing events while providing favorable effects on lipids and lipoproteins. The generalizability of this analysis may be limited by self-selection and motivation of research subjects, and further studies of flushing in the clinical practice setting are warranted. "
"Abstract: UV solar radiation is the major environmental risk factor for malignant melanoma. A great effort is currently posed on the search of new compounds able to prevent or reduce UV-mediated cell damage. Ferulic acid is a natural compound recently included in the formulation of solar protecting dermatological products. The purpose of the present work was to assess whether its ethyl ester derivative, FAEE, could protect skin melanocytes from UV-induced oxidative stress and cell damage. Experiments on human melanocytes irradiated with UVB showed that FAEE treatment reduced the generation of ROS, with a net decrease of protein oxidation. FAEE treatment was accompanied by an induction of HSP70 and heme oxygenase, by a marked suppression of PARP activation and a significant suppression of apoptosis. Moreover FAEE prevented iNOS induction, thus suppressing the secondary generation of NO-derived oxidizing agents. FAEE may represent a potentially effective pharmacological approach to reduce UV radiation-induced skin damage. "
"Abstract: Neoplastic meningitis from breast cancer often leads to a progressive neurologic deterioration followed by fatal outcome. The therapy is based on the administration of high dose systemic chemotherapy with drugs able to pass through the blood-brain barrier, such as methotrexate (MTX) and cytarabine, cranial or craniospinal irradiation, and intrathecal (IT) administration of MTX and/or cytarabine. However, these approaches only have modest efficacy and are associated with side effects for the patients. A depot formulation of liposomal cytarabine (DepoCyte) has proven to be useful in clinical trials. We describe the case of a woman with a diagnosis of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis from breast carcinoma who presented cerebrospinal fluid normalization and prolonged complete MRI response to intrathecal chemotherapy with liposomal cytarabine (DepoCyte).

"Abstract: Incorporation of unaggregated monomeric molecules of pheophorbide(a) into micelles of poly(ethyleneoxide-b-epsilon-caprolactone) has been characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and asymmetric flow field flow fractionation. It was shown that the method used leads to 20 nm micelles, corresponding to approximately 200 molecules of polymer and 4 molecules of monomeric pheophorbide(a) per nano-object which was able to generate (1)O(2) in the medium. They have been used thereafter as nanocarriers for photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy against cancer cells. The encapsulation of photosensitizer has been verified and in vitro tests on human cancerous cells have revealed a ca. 2-fold enhanced photocytotoxicity and cellular uptake compared to free pheophorbide(a). "
"BACKGROUND: The oral administration of loratadine, an antihistamine, can have a variety of adverse side effects, such as headache, fatigue, and nausea, because of the transient high blood concentration. To avoid these effects, loratadine can be administered using a transdermal drug delivery system. METHOD: This study examined the effects of the drug concentration on drug release from prepared hydroxypropyl methylcellulose gels using a synthetic cellulose membrane at 37 degrees C. The drug concentrations tested were 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, and 0.5% (w/w). The effect of temperature on drug release from the 0.3% loratadine gels was evaluated at 27 degrees C, 32 degrees C, 37 degrees C, and 42 degrees C. Various types of penetration enhancers, such as glycols, glycerides, propylene glycol derivatives, nonionic surfactants, and fatty acids, were incorporated in the gel formulation to increase the level of drug permeation. RESULTS: The rate of drug release increased with increasing drug concentration or temperature. The activation energy for the release of the drug was 5.714 kcal/mol for 0.3% loratadine gel. Among all the enhancers used in this study, polyoxyethylene 2-stearyl ether showed the best enhancing effect. The enhancement factor of the loratadine gel containing the polyoxyethylene 2-stearyl ether was 2.03 compared with that of the loratadine system containing no enhancer. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the topical gel formulation of loratadine containing a penetration enhancer could be developed to enhance the penetration of loratadine. "
"Abstract: Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are often prescribed as the first line therapy for pulmonary diseases such as asthma. The biggest concern of using steroid therapy is the systemic side effects at high dose. To reduce the side effects, the pharmaceutical industry has been putting effort to generate new drugs with maximized topical efficacy. One of the key challenges is to differentiate efficacy from local versus systemic contribution in preclinical animal models. Fluticasone with various formulations was used as a model compound to explore the possibilities to demonstrate lung targeted efficacy by intratracheally instillation in the lipopolysaccharide induced inflammation rat model. Fluticasone formulations contained various surfactant concentrations and particle sizes to achieve lung retention and lower systemic exposure. Neutrophil infiltration in broncoalveolar lavage fluid and cytokine production in whole blood were measured to assess pulmonary efficacy versus systemic efficacy. PK/PD characterization of fluticasone with various formulations in the rat inflammation model provided an integrated approach in preclinical to evaluate lung targeted efficacy for ICS. Our study concluded that the combination of the rat LPS model and fluticasone is not suitable to use for establishing potency and dose requirement for new drug candidate designed for topical only efficacy.

"Abstract: Colchicine, an alkaloid found in extracts of the plants Colchicum autumnale and Gloriosa superb, is effective in the treatment of acute gout and dermatological conditions like leuko-cytoclastic vasculitis, psoriasis, and Sweet's syndrome. Oral administration of colchicine is associated with gastrointestinal side effects and its accumulation in the body leads to bone marrow suppression. In the present study, an attempt has been made for development and in vitro and in vivo evaluation of elastic liposomal formulation for topical delivery of colchicine. The in vitro skin permeation study across rat skin found transdermal flux for different elastic liposomal formulations to range between 32.8 +/- 1.2 and 44.4 +/- 1.9 microg h(-1) cm(-2), which was approximately seven to 11 times higher than obtained using drug solution (4.3 +/- 0.6 microg h(-1) cm(-2)). The results of skin deposition study showed that elastic liposomal formulation provide 12.5-fold higher skin deposition as compared to drug solution of colchicine. Confocal laser scanning microscopy also revealed better accumulation and deeper penetration (up to 200 microm) of elastic liposomes than drug solution (up to 12 microm). The biological evaluation of various vesicular formulations and drug solution was carried out using monosodium urate-induced air pouch model. The results of anti-gout activity in rats showed better and sustained biological effects in 24 h measured in terms of exudate volume (63.1 +/- 5.7% and 9.6 +/- 0.5% reduction with elastic liposomes and drug solution, respectively), reduction in leukocyte count (74.2 +/- 6.0% and 4.1 +/- 0.3% reduction with elastic liposomes and drug solution, respectively), decrease in inflammatory cells accumulation, and collagen deposition with elastic liposomal formulation than drug solution. Hence, the present study reveals that elastic liposomal formulation of colchicine possesses greater potential to enhance skin accumulation, prolong drug release, and improve the site-specificity of colchicine.

"Abstract: The use of medicinal tar for dermatologic disorders dates back to the ancient times. Although coal tar is utilized more frequently in modern dermatology, wood tars have also been widely employed. Tar is used mainly in the treatment of chronic stable plaque psoriasis, scalp psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and seborrheic dermatitis, either alone or in combination therapy with other medications, phototherapy, or both. Many modifications have been made to tar preparations to increase their acceptability, as some dislike its odor, messy application, and staining of clothing. One should consider a tried and true treatment with tar that has led to clearing of lesions and prolonged remission times. Occupational studies have demonstrated the carcinogenicity of tar; however, epidemiologic studies do not confirm similar outcomes when used topically. This article will review the pharmacology, formulations, efficacy, and adverse effects of crude coal tar and other tars in the treatment of selected dermatologic conditions. "
"OBJECTIVE: To assess in weaned lambs the palliative effects of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, carprofen, following intradermal injection of cetrimide to induce non-surgical mulesing. PROCEDURES: We allocated 40 weaned lambs (20-22 weeks old) to four groups of 10 animals: (1) control, 2) conventional surgical mules, (3) intradermal treatment and (4) intradermal treatment + carprofen. Non-surgical mulesing was induced by intradermal injection of 4% (w/w) cetrimide + 3% (w/w) polyvinylpyrrolidone in water. In group 4, carprofen (4 mg/kg, SC) was administered 1 h before intradermal treatment. Five weaners, including an animal from each treatment, were run in each pen. Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, cortisol, beta-endorphin and haptoglobin levels and rectal temperature were monitored at least daily for the first 7 days after treatment, then weekly until day 28. Body weight was measured weekly and behaviour was measured every 15 min for 12 h on the day of treatment, then on days 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 21 and 28 following treatment. RESULTS: The intradermal treatment resulted in high fever and elevated blood cortisol by 12 h. Rectal temperatures were significantly elevated until 5 days after treatment, cortisol was elevated until 3 days after treatment, haptoglobin for at least 7 days after treatment and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio until 4 days after treatment. Average daily gain was depressed in the week following treatment. Abnormal behaviours (hunched standing, stiff walking, pawing, lateral lying and lying intention) were increased on the day of treatment and for 6 days post treatment. Carprofen reduced the time spent in abnormal behaviours by approximately two-thirds but did not ameliorate the physiological responses to the intradermal treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In weaner sheep, carprofen ameliorated the behavioural responses, but was unable to provide relief from the intense and sustained physiological responses to non-surgical mulesing by intradermal injection of cetrimide. Systemic side-effects may be unavoidable with formulations based on quaternary ammonium compounds that are designed to reduce the risk of fly strike in sheep by remodelling breech tissue through induction of tissue necrosis.

"Abstract: Topical corticosteroids are one of the oldest and most useful treatments for dermatologic conditions. There are many topical steroids available, and they differ in potency and formulation. Successful treatment depends on an accurate diagnosis and consideration of the steroid's delivery vehicle, potency, frequency of application, duration of treatment, and side effects. Although use of topical steroids is common, evidence of effectiveness exists only for select conditions, such as psoriasis, vitiligo, eczema, atopic dermatitis, phimosis, acute radiation dermatitis, and lichen sclerosus. Evidence is limited for use in melasma, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and alopecia areata. "
"Abstract: Triphala is categorized as a rejuvenator and antioxidant-rich Ayurvedic herbal formulation and has traditionally been used in various gastric problems including intestinal inflammation. The aim of the present study was to examine the comparative enteroprotective effect of Triphala formulations against methotrexate-induced intestinal damage in rats. Triphala formulations were prepared by mixing equal (1:1:1) and unequal (1:2:4) proportions of Terminalia chebula Retz., Terminalia belerica (Gaertn.) Roxb. and Emblica officinalis Gaertn. Intestinal damage was induced by administering methotrexate (MTX) in a dose of 12 mg/kg, orally for 4 days to albino rats. The intestinal damage response was assessed by gross and microscopical injury, measuring the intestinal permeability to phenol red and tissue biochemical parameters. Triphala equal and unequal formulations at the dose of 540 mg/kg significantly restored the depleted protein level in brush border membrane of intestine, phospholipid and glutathione content and decreased the myeloperoxidase and xanthine oxidase level in intestinal mucosa of methotrexate-treated rats. In addition, Triphala unequal formulation showed significant decrease in permeation clearance of phenol red with significant attenuation in the histopathological changes, level of disaccharidase in brush border membrane vesicles and lipid peroxidation content of intestinal mucosa. Based on the data generated, it is suggested that Triphala unequal formulation provides significantly more protection than Triphala equal formulation against methotrexate-induced damage in rat intestine.

"Abstract: Topically applied formulations (e.g., emollients and moisturizers) may influence the optical physics of skin and therefore the effectiveness of UVR exposures. In this issue, Lu et al. provide evidence for another type of influence by moisturizers, one that does not require the presence of the chemical agent before or during UVR exposure. Several such test agents applied after the completion of a course of UVR enhanced the tumor response in mice, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The study design is rational but the group sizes are modest, the resulting database is therefore limited, and the repeatability is not yet determined. Perhaps most important for the this Journal's readership, the clinical relevance is unknown and deserves detailed examination. "
"BACKGROUND: Solar lentigines represent a common feature of photoaging, particularly on the back of the hands. Bleaching agents are usually proposed to lighten the shade of the lesions. METHODS: The study was randomized and designed to assess the effect of a bleaching solution containing 2% mequinol (4-hydroxyanisole, 4HA) and 0.01% tretinoin (Solagé). The formulation was applied twice daily for 3 months on solar lentigines present on the back of one hand. The lesions on the other hand were treated with the ethyl alcohol vehicle which served as a control. Clinical diagnosis was confirmed using dermoscopy. In addition, objective measurements of the hypermelanosis were performed at 1-month intervals during and after treatment. Clinical assessments were used as well as narrow-band reflectance spectrophotometry, image analysis of video-recorded ultraviolet light-enhanced visualization (ULEV method) and photodensitometry of the corneomelametry test. RESULTS: The multipronged assessment of the lesional color demonstrated a significant lightening effect of the 4HA/tretinoin solution. This was demonstrated after 2 months of treatment and was maintained at least 2 months after stopping treatment. CONCLUSION: Both the visual ratings and the objective bioinstrumental methods indicate the rapid lightening effect of the 4HA/tretinoin formulation. After stopping treatment, the rate of repigmentation appeared to have slowed compared to the depigmentation phase. "
"Abstract: A topical gel containing a proprietary mixture of over 110 growth factors, cytokines, and soluble matrix proteins secreted by human dermal fibroblasts was evaluated for safety and efficacy in the treatment of mild to severe facial photodamage. In a double-blind study, 60 subjects were randomly assigned to receive either active gel or the vehicle and applied twice daily for 6 months along with a moisturizing cleanser and sunscreen. Efficacy (profilometry, photography, and clinical assessment) and safety (adverse event reporting) measures were evaluated at 0, 3, and 6 months. Treatment with the active gel for 3 months produced greater reduction in fine lines and wrinkles than the vehicle treatment as measured by objective and subjective assessment techniques. The results were either statistically significant (P < or = .05) or trending towards statistical significance (P < or = .1). This study demonstrates that addition of a topical formulation of growth factors and cytokines to a basic skin care regimen reduces the signs of photoaging. "
"Abstract: Acne affects as many as 50 million individuals in the United States. Topical therapy combining a retinoid and an antibiotic is recommended as a first-line therapeutic option for mild to moderately severe acne. Although treatment for extended durations may be required, little long-term safety data on these combination therapies are available. This report summarizes the long-term safety and tolerability of a novel combination product for the treatment of acne vulgaris in participants 12 years and older. The combination treatment is a gel formulation containing a crystalline suspension of clindamycin phosphate 1.2%-tretinoin 0.025% (CLIN/RA). Two cohorts participated in a long-term (up to 52 weeks), multicenter, open-label, safety evaluation of CLIN/RA. Treatment duration was 6 months for the first cohort (N = 442) and 12 months for the second cohort (N = 213). Overall, the CLIN/RA gel was well-tolerated; 92%, 91%, and 94% of participants reported no itching, burning, or stinging, respectively. The most frequent adverse events were acne (29/442; 7% [usually a flare]), sunburn (12/442; 3%), hypersensitivity (7/442; 2%), contact dermatitis (5/442; 1%), and application-site desquamation (3/442; 1%). These results confirm the safety of CLIN/RA gel for mild to moderately severe acne. The CLIN/RA gel fixed-dose combination provided minimal adverse events and a favorable safety profile for 2 agents with established efficacy for the treatment of acne vulgaris. "
"Abstract: This author discusses the utility and versatility of the modern croton oil peel, which, unlike older formulations, may be used for all ages and skin types for effective and long-lasting skin resurfacing. He provides the rationale for various croton oil concentrations, focusing on avoiding complications while achieving a desirable clinical result and includes a comprehensive guide to application, appropriate formulas, and the perioperative process. Of significance is that this is a procedure with a distinct learning curve; the goal for the experienced practitioner is to control the application process, proceeding slowly enough to be able to stop at the appropriate depth.

"INTRODUCTION: Methotrexate, a folate antagonist, is a mainstay treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It is also widely used in a low dose formulation to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In rats, methotrexate is known to induce micronuclei formation, leading to genetic damage, while vitamin A is known to protect against such methotrexate-induced genetic damage. Leucovorin (folinic acid) is generally administered with methotrexate to decrease methotrexate-induced toxicity. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine whether vitamin A and leucovorin differed in their capacity to prevent formation of methotrexate-induced micronuclei in rat bone marrow erythrocytes. The present study also aimed to evaluate the effect of combined treatment with vitamin A and leucovorin on the formation of methotrexate-induced micronuclei. METHODS: Male and female Wistar rats (n=8) were injected with 20 mg/kg methotrexate (single i.p. dose). The control group received an equal volume of distilled water. The third and fourth groups of rats received vitamin A (5000 IU daily dose for 4 successive days) and leucovorin (0.5 mg/kg i.p. dose for 4 successive days), respectively. The fifth and sixth groups of rats received a combination of vitamin A and a single dose of methotrexate and a combination of leucovorin and methotrexate, respectively. The last group of rats received a combination of leucovorin, vitamin A and single dose of methotrexate. Samples were collected at 24 hours after the last dose of the treatment into 5% bovine albumin. Smears were obtained and stained with May-Grunwald and Giemsa. One thousand polychromatic erythrocytes were counted per animal for the presence of micronuclei and the percentage of polychromatic erythrocyte was determined. RESULTS: Comparison of methotrexate-treated rats with the control group showed a significant increase in the percentage of cells with micronuclei and a significant decrease polychromatic erythrocyte percentage. Combined methotrexate and vitamin A therapy and combined methotrexate and leucovorin therapy led to significant decreases in the micronuclei percentage and an increase in polychromatic erythrocyte percentage when compared to rats treated with methotrexate alone. Leucovorin was found to be more effective than vitamin A against the formation of methotrexate-induced micronuclei. CONCLUSIONS: Both vitamin A and leucovorin provided significant protection against genetic damage induced by methotrexate. "
"Abstract: Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis [MAP], the causative agent of enteric Johne's disease, incurs significant economic losses to the livestock industry. Prophylactic vaccination can be employed as a control means, however mineral oil-based vaccines currently in practice have limited efficacy, produce strong antibody responses that confound serological diagnostic testing, and cause severe injection site reactions. In the present study, the safety and efficacy of a commercial mineral oil-adjuvanted vaccine (Gudair) was compared with novel parenteral-route vaccines in sheep; these comprised live or heat-killed (HK) whole cell preparations of MAP strain 316F, formulated into a food-grade lipid vaccine delivery matrix. Subcutaneous administration of lipid-formulated live or HK 316F-induced significantly fewer adverse injection site reactions than Gudair; adverse injection site reactions were eliminated altogether by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of lipid-formulated live 316F. Injections of lipid-formulated 316F-induced significant peripheral blood cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses in the absence of antibody, while Gudair-induced strong antibody and CMI reactivity. Vaccinated and non-vaccinated control sheep were challenged via oral inoculation of a virulent MAP isolate, and disease progress was monitored for 16 months, followed by necropsy. All vaccine regimes reduced the overall pathological grading of biopsied intestinal tract (IT) tissues; among these, only Gudair promoted a significant reduction in the incidence of histopathological IT lesions, while only i.p. injection of lipid-formulated live 316F significantly reduced the incidence of gross IT lesions. All lipid-formulated vaccines (but not Gudair) significantly reduced the incidence of bacteriological culture-confirmed MAP infection. This study identifies a new vaccination strategy against Johne's disease in sheep using conventional MAP vaccine strains formulated in a metabolisable lipid delivery matrix. "
"Abstract: Intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy is an important component of the prophylaxis or treatment of hematologic malignancies in the central nervous system (CNS), especially in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and aggressive lymphomas. Different regimens of IT chemotherapies have been formulated, often in conjunction with systemic high-dose chemotherapy leading to penetration of the drugs into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The three commonest IT drugs are methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), and corticosteroids. The CSF half-lives of methotrexate and Ara-C are much prolonged, a factor to be considered if these drugs are also administered systemically in high doses. Neurotoxicities attributed to IT chemotherapy have been reported, including spinal cord lesions, seizures, and encephalopathy. Spinal cord lesions, manifesting as tetraplegia, paraplegia, and cauda equina syndrome, are the commonest neurotoxicity. It is mostly related to combined IT methotrexate and Ara-C, or Ara-C as the sole IT agent when given at high doses or as a slow-release preparation. Cord lesions rarely recover and patients are left with motor deficits, bowel and urinary disabilities. Seizures and encephalopathy are reported in relatively fewer patients, with variable manifestations and prognosis. Knowledge of the pharmacokinetics, dosing schedules and potential toxicities of IT chemotherapeutic drugs is important in the design of CNS prophylaxis and treatment in hematologic malignancies. "
"BACKGROUND: Because systemic treatment of psoriasis is associated with several adverse effects, methotrexate (MTX), either topically or as targeted delivery, has become a more-interesting alternative. MATERIAL/METHODS: Methotrexate liposomes (LMTX) were prepared from DPPC, soy PC, egg yolk PC, and cholesterol. We studied the characterization, formulation of hydrogel (MTX 0.25%), and skin permeability, and compared LMTX gel with plain MTX gel and placebo for treating localized psoriasis in a double-blind study using albino mice. Gel formulations were applied daily, followed by irradiation with 80 joules from a 650-nm diode laser 3 times weekly for 12 weeks. Changes in disease signs and histopathological features were assessed. RESULTS: Drug release increased as laser energy increased following Higuchi's diffusion model and changed to zero order with energies > or = 80 J; significantly more MTX was released at all time intervals. Both LMTX and FMTX gels showed zero order kinetic release and antipsoriatic activity. During 8 months' follow-up, up to 60% of the patients treated with LMTX gel had no recurrence; this difference was statistically significant. No clinically significant changes were seen regarding blood or other laboratory variables. CONCLUSIONS: Application of an 80-J diode laser to 0.25% LMTX hydrogel was beneficial for relieving psoriasis and did not exert systemic toxicity. "
"Abstract: Toxicities of ZnO, TiO2 and CuO nanoparticles to Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata were determined using OECD 201 algal growth inhibition test taking in account potential shading of light. The results showed that the shading effect by nanoparticles was negligible. ZnO nanoparticles were most toxic followed by nano CuO and nano TiO2. The toxicities of bulk and nano ZnO particles were both similar to that of ZnSO4 (72 h EC50 approximately 0.04 mg Zn/l). Thus, in this low concentration range the toxicity was attributed solely to solubilized Zn2+ ions. Bulk TiO2 (EC50=35.9 mg Ti/l) and bulk CuO (EC50=11.55 mg Cu/l) were less toxic than their nano formulations (EC50=5.83 mg Ti/l and 0.71 mg Cu/l). NOEC (no-observed-effect-concentrations) that may be used for risk assessment purposes for bulk and nano ZnO did not differ (approximately 0.02 mg Zn/l). NOEC for nano CuO was 0.42 mg Cu/l and for bulk CuO 8.03 mg Cu/l. For nano TiO2 the NOEC was 0.98 mg Ti/l and for bulk TiO2 10.1 mg Ti/l. Nano TiO2 formed characteristic aggregates entrapping algal cells that may contribute to the toxic effect of nano TiO2 to algae. At 72 h EC50 values of nano CuO and CuO, 25% of copper from nano CuO was bioavailable and only 0.18% of copper from bulk CuO. Thus, according to recombinant bacterial and yeast Cu-sensors, copper from nano CuO was 141-fold more bioavailable than from bulk CuO. Also, toxic effects of Cu oxides to algae were due to bioavailable copper ions. To our knowledge, this is one of the first systematic studies on effects of metal oxide nanoparticles on algal growth and the first describing toxic effects of nano CuO towards algae. "
"OBJECTIVES: To develop evidence-based recommendations for the use of methotrexate in daily clinical practice in rheumatic disorders. METHODS: 751 rheumatologists from 17 countries participated in the 3E (Evidence, Expertise, Exchange) Initiative of 2007-8 consisting of three separate rounds of discussions and Delphi votes. Ten clinical questions concerning the use of methotrexate in rheumatic disorders were formulated. A systematic literature search in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and 2005-7 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism meeting abstracts was conducted. Selected articles were systematically reviewed and the evidence was appraised according to the Oxford levels of evidence. Each country elaborated a set of national recommendations. Finally, multinational recommendations were formulated and agreement among the participants and the potential impact on their clinical practice was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 16 979 references was identified, of which 304 articles were included in the systematic reviews. Ten multinational key recommendations on the use of methotrexate were formulated. Nine recommendations were specific for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), including the work-up before initiating methotrexate, optimal dosage and route, use of folic acid, monitoring, management of hepatotoxicity, long-term safety, mono versus combination therapy and management in the perioperative period and before/during pregnancy. One recommendation concerned methotrexate as a steroid-sparing agent in other rheumatic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Ten recommendations for the use of methotrexate in daily clinical practice focussed on RA were developed, which are evidence based and supported by a large panel of rheumatologists, enhancing their validity and practical use.

"BACKGROUND: A variety of treatment modalities have been described for cutaneous warts. We sought to determine the safety and efficacy of a topical formulation of cantharidin, podophyllotoxin, and salicylic acid in the treatment of plantar warts. This combination treatment is widely used in Europe and elsewhere but has not been described in the podiatric medical literature. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of 144 patients with simple or mosaic plantar warts who were treated with a topical, pharmacy-compounded solution of cantharidin, 1%; podophyllotoxin, 5%; and salicylic acid, 30%. All of the patients, aged 8 to 52 years (mean +/- SD, 20.9+/-11.0 years), were treated according to the authors' standard protocol. Of the 144 patients, 92 were being treated for the first time. None of the 52 previously treated patients had received more than one other type of treatment in the past. RESULTS: After 6 months of follow-up, complete eradication of the plantar warts was noted in 138 of the 144 patients (95.8%). Of these patients, 125 (86.8%) required a single application of the solution, and 13 (9.0%) needed two or more applications. No significant adverse effects or complications were observed. CONCLUSION: A topical solution of cantharidin, podophyllotoxin, and salicylic acid was found to be safe and effective in the treatment of simple and mosaic plantar warts. This formulation is a promising alternative treatment modality for plantar warts. "
"Abstract: Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) is a rare, blistering autoimmune disease characterized by linear deposits of IgA at the basement membrane zone (BMZ), with the possible presence of circulating IgA anti-BMZ antibodies. LABD of childhood is usually self-healing, while in adults it follows a more prolonged course and refractory cases may rarely occur. The first-line treatment for LABD is dapsone in monotherapy or in combination with systemic corticosteroids, but various therapeutic approaches have been used in non-responder patients. We report two adult patients with refractory LABD successfully treated with enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS), a recently introduced formulation of mycophenolic acid (MPA). MPA is an immunosuppressive agent that acts by inhibiting monophosphate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the novo synthesis of purines. Based on the present cases, we indicate EC-MPS as being a safe and effective adjuvant therapy in the treatment of LABD when dapsone or the other steroid-sparing drugs fail. It seems to offer an improved gastric side effect profile in comparison with the classic formulation of MPA, namely its ester mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). "
"BACKGROUND: Certolizumab pegol is a PEGylated tumour necrosis factor inhibitor. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of certolizumab pegol versus placebo, plus methotrexate (MTX), in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: An international, multicentre, phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in active adult-onset RA. Patients (n = 619) were randomised 2:2:1 to subcutaneous certolizumab pegol (liquid formulation) 400 mg at weeks 0, 2 and 4 followed by 200 mg or 400 mg plus MTX, or placebo plus MTX, every 2 weeks for 24 weeks. The primary end point was ACR20 response at week 24. Secondary end points included ACR50 and ACR70 responses, change from baseline in modified Total Sharp Score, ACR core set variables and physical function. RESULTS: Significantly more patients in the certolizumab pegol 200 mg and 400 mg groups achieved an ACR20 response versus placebo (p< or =0.001); rates were 57.3%, 57.6% and 8.7%, respectively. Certolizumab pegol 200 and 400 mg also significantly inhibited radiographic progression; mean changes from baseline in mTSS at week 24 were 0.2 and -0.4, respectively, versus 1.2 for placebo (rank analysis p< or =0.01). Certolizumab pegol-treated patients reported rapid and significant improvements in physical function versus placebo; mean changes from baseline in HAQ-DI at week 24 were -0.50 and -0.50, respectively, versus -0.14 for placebo (p< or =0.001). Most adverse events were mild or moderate, with low incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events. Five patients developed tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: Certolizumab pegol plus MTX was more efficacious than placebo plus MTX, rapidly and significantly improving signs and symptoms of RA and physical function and inhibiting radiographic progression. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00175877. "
Abstract: This paper reports an LC/MS/MS method for analysis of salemeterol and fluticasone propionate in human plasma based on combined SPE-based extraction and separate LC/MS/MS conditions. Previously reported interaction between analytes was confirmed and eliminated by their separation in the sample preparation step to ensure no negative impact on their quantitation. The method was validated per FDA guidelines in the range of 2.5-500 pg/mL for salmeterol and 5-500 pg/mL for fluticasone propionate. The method is suitable for plasma analysis of combined salmeterol/fluticasone formulation without adverse effects of inter-analyte interactions on quantitation. 
"Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising method for the localized treatment of solid tumors. In order to enhance the efficacy of PDT, we have recently developed a novel class of photosensitizer formulation, i.e., the dendrimer phthalocyanine (DPc)-encapsulated polymeric micelle (DPc/m). The DPc/m induced efficient and unprecedentedly rapid cell death accompanied by characteristic morphological changes such as blebbing of cell membranes, when the cells were photoirradiated using a low power halogen lamp or a high power diode laser. The fluorescent microscopic observation using organelle-specific dyes demonstrated that DPc/m might accumulate in the endo-/lysosomes; however, upon photoirradiation, DPc/m might be promptly released into the cytoplasm and photodamage the mitochondria, which may account for the enhanced photocytotoxicity of DPc/m. This study also demonstrated that DPc/m showed significantly higher in vivo PDT efficacy than clinically used Photofrin (polyhematoporphyrin esters, PHE) in mice bearing human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. Furthermore, the DPc/m-treated mice did not show skin phototoxiciy, which was apparently observed for the PHE-treated mice, under the tested conditions. These results strongly suggest the usefulness of DPc/m in clinical PDT. "
"Abstract: Sunscreen must provide protection against solar radiation and be safe and non-irritating to skin and eyes, especially for children. A unique water-in-oil emulsion sunscreen formula with a sun protection factor of 50 (SPF50) was developed that minimizes irritation potential through careful selection of ingredients, active combinations, preservatives, and the absence of fragrance. The SPF50 sunscreen formulation reported here is non-irritating to the skin or eyes, with an estimated Draize ocular score of 0.0 for lotion and 3.6 for spray lotion formulations. No eyelid inflammation, lacrimation, or palpebral or bulbar conjunctival irritation was observed in human eye instillation studies. This sunscreen provides a new tear-free formulation that protects from ultraviolet radiation. "
"Abstract: Prevention of exposure to the neurotoxic organophosphorus compounds (OP) is a major concern both for pesticide users and soldiers. Skin barrier creams are being developed to complement or replace uncomfortable chemical protective suits. Quick evaluation of formulations efficacy mainly relies on in vitro tests which lead to consistent, complementary and relevant results. The objectives of this work were to determine the consistency of results from in vitro tests and importance of the formulation composition in the skin protective efficacy. The efficacy of three formulations, i.e. oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions and perfluorinated compounds-based cream, was evaluated against the OP paraoxon in vitro. Our results indicated that the least effective formulations could be quickly identified by performing in vitro permeation tests with silicone membrane and by evaluating interfacial interactions between formulations and OP. Among the tested formulations, the perfluorinated compounds-based cream could have a broader spectrum of efficacy than emulsions against OP and other toxic chemicals. "
"Abstract: Clindamycin phosphate 1.2% together with tretinoin 0.025% as a gel (CTG) is a topical formulation of a fixed and stable combination approved by the FDA for the treatment of acne vulgaris in patients 12 years of age or older. The main indication of CTG is the management of moderate comedonal and mild-to-moderate papulopustular acne, an acne form which is present in more than 50% of acne patients. CTG can also be combined with systemic antiacne therapy, such as systemic isotretinoin, in nodulocystic acne. The product combines the anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties of clindamycin with the well proven and beneficial comedolytic and anticomedogenic effects of tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid). The addition of clindamycin to tretinoin enhances the comedolytic efficacy of tretinoin in moderate-to-severe acne of the face. The comedolytic activity of tretinoin and the anti-inflammatory efficacy of clindamycin accelerate resolution of all types of acne lesions without affecting the safety of both compounds. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events related to this formulation were found to be low (</= 1%). Safety of CTG use in pregnancy has not been established. The combination formulation is mainly designed to enhance effectiveness and minimize irritation. The once daily use of CTG, its rapid and dual effect and good tolerability have a positive impact on the duration of disease, patients' compliance and overall costs of therapy. "
Abstract: An evaluation of the potential hazards associated with mutagenicity and acute toxicity of a mycoherbicide formulation based on the fungal pathogen Cercospora piaropi was performed. Neither the mycoherbicide nor any of its components were mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 with or without metabolic activation. Both the C. piaropi and the mycoherbicide formulation were shown to be moderately toxic with a bacterial bioluminescence assay. No acute toxicity was found in water samples taken from tanks after treatment of water hyacinth with the mycoherbicide. 
"Abstract: Coal Tar is a semisolid by-product obtained in the destructive distillation of bituminous coal, which functions in cosmetic products as a cosmetic biocide and denaturant--antidandruff agent is also listed as a function, but this is considered an over-the-counter (OTC) drug use. Coal Tar is a nearly black, viscous liquid, heavier than water, with a naphthalene-like odor and a sharp burning taste, produced in cooking ovens as a by-product in the manufacture of coke. Crude Coal Tar is composed of 48% hydrocarbons, 42% carbon, and 10% water. In 2002, Coal Tar was reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be used in four formulations, all of which appear to be OTC drug products. Coal Tar is monographed by the FDA as Category I (safe and effective) OTC drug ingredient for use in the treatment of dandruff, seborrhoea, and psoriasis. Coal Tar is absorbed through the skin of animals and humans and is systemically distributed. In short-term studies, mice fed a diet containing Coal Tar found it unpalatable, but no adverse effects were reported other than weight loss; rats injected with Coal Tar experienced malaise in one study and decreased water intake and increased liver weights in another; rabbits injected with Coal Tar residue experienced eating avoidance, respiratory difficulty, sneezing, and weight loss. In a subchronic neurotoxicity study using mice, a mixture of phenols, cresols, and xylenols at concentrations approximately equal to those expected in Coal Tar extracts produced regionally selective effects, with a rank order of corpus striatum > cerebellum > cerebral cortex. Coal Tar applied to the backs of guinea pigs increases epidermal thickness. Painting female rabbits with tar decreases the absolute and relative weights of the ovaries and decreased the number of interstitial cells in the ovary. Four therapeutic Coal Tar preparations used in the treatment of psoriasis were mutagenic in the Ames assay. Urine and blood from patients treated with Coal Tar were genotoxic in bacterial assays. Coal Tar was genotoxic in a mammalian genotoxicity assay and induced DNA adducts in various tissue types. Chronic exposure of mice to Coal Tar significantly decreased survival and liver neoplasms were seen in a significant dose-related trend; in other studies using mice lung tumors and perianal skin cancers were found. Coal Tar was comedogenic in three small clinical studies. Folliculitis is associated with the prolonged use of some tars. Several published reports describe cases of contact sensitivity to Coal Tar. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which make up Coal Tar, are photosensitizers and cause phototoxicity by an oxygen-dependent mechanism. A retrospective study of the reproductive toxicity of Coal Tar in humans compared exposed women to controls and found little difference in spontaneous abortion and congenital disorders. Cancer epidemiology studies of patients who have received Coal Tar therapy of one form or other have failed to link treatment with an increase in the risk of cancer. Although the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel believes that Coal Tar use as an antidandruff ingredient in OTC drug preparations is adequately addressed by the FDA regulations, the Panel also believes that the appropriate concentration of use of Coal Tar in cosmetic formulations should be that level that does not have a biological effect in the user. Additional data needed to make a safety assessment include product types in which Coal Tar is used (other than as an OTC drug ingredient), use concentrations, and the maximum concentration that does not induce a biological effect in users.

"Abstract: The formation of free radicals is a widely accepted pivotal mechanism leading to skin aging. Free radicals are highly reactive molecules with unpaired electrons that can directly damage various cellular structural membranes, lipids, proteins, and DNA. The damaging effects of these reactive oxygen species are induced internally during normal metabolism and externally through various oxidative stresses. The production of free radicals increases with age, while the endogenous defense mechanisms that counter them decrease. This imbalance leads to the progressive damage of cellular structures, and thus, results in accelerated aging. Antioxidants are substances that can provide protection from endogenous and exogenous oxidative stresses by scavenging free radicals. Topical antioxidants are available in multivariate combinations through over-the-counter skin care products that are aimed at preventing the clinical signs of photoaging. "
"Abstract: The aim of the present investigation was to develop and study topical gel delivery of curcumin for its anti-inflammatory effects. Carbopol 934P (CRB) and hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) were used for the preparation of gels. The penetration enhancing effect of menthol (0-12.5% w/w) on the percutaneous flux of curcumin through the excised rat epidermis from 2% w/w CRB and HPC gel system was investigated. All the prepared gel formulations were evaluated for various properties such as compatibility, drug content, viscosity, in vitro skin permeation, and anti-inflammatory effect. The drug and polymers compatibility was confirmed by Differential scanning calorimetry and infrared spectroscopy. The percutaneous flux and enhancement ratio of curcumin across rat epidermis was enhanced markedly by the addition of menthol to both types of gel formulations. Both types of developed topical gel formulations were free of skin irritation. In anti-inflammatory studies done by carrageenan induced rat paw oedema method in wistar albino rats, anti-inflammatory effect of CRB, HPC and standard gel formulations were significantly different from control group (P < 0.05) whereas this effect was not significantly different for CRB and HPC gels formulations to that of standard (diclofenac gel) formulation (P > 0.05). CRB gel showed better % inhibition of inflammation as compared to HPC gel. "
"Abstract: The purpose of this study was the development of a microbiological method for the assessment of the ultraviolet (UV) screening effect of sunscreen preparations and determination of their sun protection factor. The method is based on the lethal effect of UV radiation on Escherichia coli (E. coli ) and the protective ability of sunscreens. The time of UV exposure required for the reduction of the E. coli viable count by 90% (decimal reduction time, DRT) was used as the photoprotection assessment parameter. The method was tested by assessing the effect of selected experimental variables on the DRT. The suitability of the method as a quality control tool for sunscreen preparations was then checked by assessing the influence of selected formulation variables on the photoprotective effect of a series of o/w emulsion formulations with different compositions. The method proved valid for detecting changes in the photoprotective effect of a market sunscreen product as a result of modifying experimental conditions. It also proved valid for ranking market sunscreen products according to their UV screening effect. Equally important, the method could successfully detect changes in the photoprotective effect of sunscreen test formulations as a function of the concentration and type of the sunscreen agents. "
"Abstract: Sunscreens have been around for more than 70 years. Designed originally to protect against sunburn, recognition of the various harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation has broadened the use of sunscreens. The addition of effective UVA sunscreen agents has enabled claims beyond protection against sunburn to include prevention of idiopathic photodermatosis, actinic keratoses, skin cancer, and photoaging. This article will review some of the recent advances in photoprotection, including the development of sunscreen formulations offering higher and broader protection against solar radiation. "
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Generalized skin sensitization is a main drawback of photodynamic therapy with systemic administration of photosensitizers. We have evaluated the potential use of an intratumoral injection of a liposomal formulation of mTHPC (Foslip) in a mouse model of local recurrence of breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were directly injected into the tumor (IT) with 25 microl of a Foslip suspension (0.15 mg/ml) and illumination (652 nm, 20 J/cm(2)) was performed at different time points with pathological assessment after 48 hours. In a parallel mice series plasma samples were obtained at different endpoints after IT Foslip injection for HPLC analysis and the tumors were subjected in toto to macrofluorescence imaging. Fluorescence polarization measurements were conducted in vitro to estimate the rate of sensitizer redistribution from liposomes. RESULTS: Optimal, albeit partial, cure rates were obtained at 24 hours post-sensitizer and uninistration. Inhomogeneous and weak fluorescence was observed at early time points and became maximal at 24 hours. Plasma levels of mTHPC increased until 15 hours. Fluorescence polarization measurements showed a slow sensitizer transfer from liposomes to model membranes. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The weak intratumoral fluorescence at early time points could be explained by concentration quenching within the liposomes as evidenced from fluorescence polarization studies. Progressive mTHPC redistribution from liposomes and its further incorporation into tumor tissue resulted in fluorescence build-up over time with a maximum at 24 hours post-injection. This correlates perfectly with the best therapeutic effect at this time point. The absence of total cure can be attributed to inhomogeneous photosensitizer distribution. mTHPC is reabsorbed into the blood stream but the total administered amount is much reduced as opposed to systemic administration so that repeated PDT sessions might be favorable in terms of side effects and tumor response.

"Abstract: The trial objective was to investigate the feasibility and safety of conversion to a generic microemulsion cyclosporine in stable renal transplant patients premaintained on Neoral. We enrolled 75 patients from seven centers in five Middle Eastern countries monitored them for 6 months after conversion to Sigmasporin Microral. Readings at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4.5, and 6 months included cyclosporine blood level, serum creatinine, liver enzymes, lipid profile, blood sugar, blood pressure and adverse events. Patients included 54 men and 21 women of mean age 38.9 +/- 10.7 years at 30.3 +/- 29.3 months post-transplantation maintained on Sigmasporin Microral dose of 2.8 +/- 1.0 mg/kg per day; they were observed to be stable throughout the study period as reflected by the therapeutic blood C0 level of 181.6 +/- 102.1 and C2 of 759.2 +/- 384.4. Their absorption profile as represented by C2/C0 was 4.9 +/- 2.8, and C2/cyclosporine dose of 282.3 +/- 128.8. An average serum creatinine level of 116.1 +/- 29.5 micromol/L denoted stable graft function and their liver enzymes did not change during the study. No new-onset cases of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or hyperlipidemia were reported among the patients. Graft function was stable for all patients, except for two incidences of mild acute rejection and two of mild cyclosporine nephrotoxicity; graft and patient survival rates were both 100%. Results of this 6-month study showed that Sigmasporin Microral was effective to maintain stable renal function in kidney transplant patients converted from Neoral with similar safety and tolerability profiles as those reported in the literature.

"BACKGROUND: Effective and safe products are needed for long-term management of scalp psoriasis. This study investigated the long-term safety and efficacy of a two-compound formulation (calcipotriol 50 microg/g plus betamethasone dipropionate 0.5 mg/g) for scalp psoriasis. METHODS: In this 52-week, international, double-blind study, 869 patients with moderate-to-severe scalp psoriasis were randomized to either a two-compound scalp formulation (n = 429) or calcipotriol (n = 440). RESULTS: Adverse drug reactions were less frequent in the two-compound group compared with the calcipotriol group (17.2 vs. 29.5%; p < 0.001). Incidences of adverse events possibly associated with long-term corticosteroid use were low in both the two-compound (2.6%) and the calcipotriol (3.0%) groups. Disease was satisfactorily controlled in 92.3% of visits in the two-compound group versus 80.0% in the calcipotriol group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The two-compound scalp formulation demonstrated a high level of safety and efficacy in long-term management of scalp psoriasis. "
"Abstract: Cyclosporine A (CsA) loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) for topical ophthalmic applications were prepared by high shear homogenization and ultrasound method using Compritol 888 ATO, Poloxamer 188 and Tween 80, to investigate the cellular uptake of rabbit corneal epithelial cells (RCE) and to evaluate the cytotoxicity. The size of the optimized formulation was 225.9+/-5.5 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.253+/-0.05. The zeta potential and entrapment efficiency was detected as -16.9+/-0.7 mV and 95.6%, respectively. The CsA release was found to be enzyme (lipase/co-lipase complex) dependent. SLNs were sterilized at 110 and 121 degrees C. The cytotoxicity was evaluated in vitro by means of RCE cells and was higher at 121 degrees C sterilization temperature, probably due to a supposed leakage of Tween 80 following lipid re-crystallization. The permeation and penetration of CsA across/into the corneal cells were evaluated using in vitro and ex vivo experiments. The cellular uptake was investigated by replacing CsA with the fluorescent dye Rhodamine B. The penetration enhancement properties were supported by confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis. The internalization of SLNs in cornea and in RCE cell lines was confirmed, pointing out the possibility of CsA targeting to the cornea. "
"BACKGROUND: Localized irritation can limit treatment success with topical retinoids such as tretinoin and adapalene. The factors that influence irritant reactions have been shown to include individual skin sensitivity, the particular retinoid and concentration used, and the vehicle formulation. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cutaneous tolerability of tretinoin 0.04% microsphere gel (TMG) with that of adapalene 0.3% gel and a standard tretinoin 0.025% cream. METHODS: The results of 2 randomized, investigator-blinded studies of 2 to 3 weeks' duration, which utilized a split-face method to compare cumulative irritation scores induced by topical retinoids in subjects with healthy skin, were combined. Study 1 compared TMG 0.04% with adapalene 0.3% gel over 2 weeks, while study 2 compared TMG 0.04% with tretinoin 0.025% cream over 3 weeks. RESULTS: In study 1, TMG 0.04% was associated with significantly lower cumulative scores for erythema, dryness, and burning/stinging than adapalene 0.3% gel. However, in study 2, there were no significant differences in cumulative irritation scores between TMG 0.04% and tretinoin 0.025% cream. Measurements of erythema by a chromameter showed no significant differences between the test formulations in either study. CONCLUSION: Cutaneous tolerance of TMG 0.04% on the face was superior to that of adapalene 0.3% gel and similar to that of a standard tretinoin cream containing a lower concentration of the drug (0.025%). "
"BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris can persist beyond adolescence into the fourth decade of life or later; most patients have a combination of inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether tretinoin microsphere gel (TMG) 0.04% applied once nightly is well tolerated and effective in reducing inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions in adolescents and adults with mild to moderate facial acne. METHODS: The results of 3 randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies of TMG 0.04% applied once nightly for 12 consecutive weeks in a total of 629 patients, ages 11 to 49 years, were combined. Reductions in acne lesion counts were assessed twice monthly, and an investigator's global evaluation (IGE) was performed at the study endpoint (week 12). RESULTS: Tretinoin microsphere gel 0.04% was significantly superior to the vehicle gel in reducing both inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions over the 12-week treatment period, and produced a higher successful treatment rate than the vehicle gel, as judged by IGE ratings at week 12. The most frequent adverse events were erythema, peeling, and dryness, which were mostly mild and occurred in 59.7% to 63.3% of patients with TMG 0.04%, as compared with 26.9% to 51.0% of patients with the vehicle gel (placebo). CONCLUSION: The TMG 0.04% formulation is significantly superior when compared to its vehicle gel in reducing inflammatory and noninflammatory acne lesions over a period of 12 weeks and is well tolerated.

"Abstract: The possibility of improving the efficacy of resveratrol, a polyphenol with strong antioxidant and free-radical scavenging properties, on cell proliferation and photoprotection by liposomal incorporation was investigated. Oligolamellar vesicles of different lipid compositions, loaded with resveratrol, were prepared and characterized by evaluating size, zeta potential, incorporation efficiency, electron microscopy and stability over 60 days. The effect of free and liposomal resveratrol on the viability of HEK 293 cells and their photoprotection after UV-B irradiation was assessed by the MTS method. Resveratrol decreased the cell viability at 100microM concentration, while at 10microM increased cell proliferation and also achieved the most effective photoprotection. Photomicrographs of the treated cells from inverted light and fluorescence microscopy demonstrated resveratrol effectiveness at 10microM, as well as its toxicity at higher concentrations, based on changes in cell shape, detachment and apoptotic features. Interestingly, liposomes prevented the cytotoxicity of resveratrol at high concentrations, even at 100microM, avoiding its immediate and massive intracellular distribution, and increased the ability of resveratrol to stimulate the proliferation of the cells and their ability to survive under stress conditions caused by UV-B light. "
"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Oxybenzone is an active ingredient found in sunscreen products that absorbs a broad spectrum of ultraviolet (UV) light, with absorbance peaking in the UVB region and extending into the UVA region. Although the overall incidence of sensitization and irritation associated with oxybenzone in the general population remains unclear, a few studies have reported on the incidence in specific circumstances. However, the relevance of these studies to the general population is limited, because the sample populations reported in these papers generally have consisted of individuals who sought medical attention for pre-existing skin conditions. Therefore, the reported incidence of allergic reactions to oxybenzone in these studies may be overestimated as related to the general population. The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine the safety of oxybenzone in participants recruited from the general population. METHODS: The data from 64 unpublished exaggerated use human repeat insult patch tests (HRIPT) and photoallergy (PA) studies sponsored by Schering-Plough HealthCare Products Inc. between 1992 and 2006 were aggregated and analyzed to evaluate the irritancy and sensitization potential of sunscreen products containing oxybenzone at concentrations between 1% and 6%. RESULTS: Forty-eight of 19 570 possible dermal responses were considered to be suggestive of irritation or sensitization; the mean rate of responses across all formulations was 0.26%. Sensitization rates did not correlate significantly with oxybenzone concentration. The available re-challenge data indicated that only eight of these responses were contact allergies from oxybenzone, and the mean rate of contact allergy to oxybenzone was 0.07%. The source of the skin responses was not confirmed for 15 subjects who were lost to follow-up. However, all subjects were given the opportunity to participate in follow-up testing. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that sunscreen products formulated with 1-6% oxybenzone do not possess a significant sensitization or irritation potential for the general public. Furthermore, these data suggest that the incidence rate implied in the published literature overestimates the actual incidence of sensitization/irritation due to oxybenzone-containing sunscreen products in the general population.

"BACKGROUND: UVA exposure of human skin mainly produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to DNA, cell and tissue damage. It alters immune function, pigmentation and it is certainly responsible for a large part of photoaging changes. Moreover UVA is implicated in the etiology of several photodermatoses. As a consequence, to provide adequate protection, sunscreens or skin care products for daily use protective products need UVA absorbers combined with UVB ones. AIM: To assess the efficacy of sunscreens containing a broad-spectrum UVA absorber the Mexoryls SX or ecamsule and to compare formulations with and without it through a large number of clinical studies in human volunteers and patients. METHODS: The following assessments were conducted: *Prevention of excessive pigmentation induced by UV exposure in Caucasian and Asian skins using a method that measures pigmentation protection factors (PPF). *Efficacy against DNA damage by measurement of pyrimidine dimer formation and p53 protein accumulation. *Protection of immune system using delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions to recall antigens, isomerization of urocanic acid (UCA), alteration of Langerhans cells (LC) density, morphology and function. *Reduction of epidermal and dermal alterations induced by repeated UVA or UV solar simulated radiation (SSR) using histology or immunohistology. *Prevention of the polymorphous light eruption (PMLE) in patients prone to develop this disease. RESULTS: Mexoryls SX-containing formulations showed a dose-dependent level of protection against pigmentation. For a same sun protection factor (SPF) the higher the UVA protection was, the higher was the PPF. Pyrimidine dimer formation and p53 accumulation were significantly reduced by formulations with Mexoryls SX. In the studies looking at the suppression of DTH reactions to recall antigens by the different UV spectra, the LC alterations and the cis UCA formation, Mexoryls SX formulations always showed a higher protective potency than sunscreen without it even when the protection against erythema was similar (products with same SPF). Mexoryls SX formulations also prevented or significantly decreased to minimal, ferritin, tenascin and lysozyme expression induced by repeated UVA or SSR exposure. It also reduced the enhancement of collagenase 2 mRNA expression induced by SSR exposure. Finally PMLE study demonstrated that UVA protection was essential for the prevention of this photodermatose. CONCLUSION: Mexoryls SX formulated in sunscreens or daily use products have been shown to be an effective UV absorber, leading to an increased efficacy of these products against a large number of biological damage induced by UVA, SSR or sun exposure.

"Abstract: Allergies to iron salts are seldom reported. We studied a patient with iron-deficiency anemia who had suffered anaphylactic reactions caused by oral iron salts. An allergy study was performed using single-blind, placebo-controlled oral challenge and skin tests with various iron salts as well as excipients in commercial formulations. Oral challenges were positive for 2 of the commercial formulations of iron salts. Intradermal tests with ferrous sulphate and ferrous lactate also showed positive results. All of the cutaneous tests using the excipients were negative. A desensitization protocol was designed which enabled us to readminister ferrous sulphate, although antihistamines were necessary to guarantee good tolerance to iron salts. We report a patient with allergy to iron salts, positive skin tests, and positive controlled challenge. We highlight the desensitization protocol designed to complete the therapeutic management of the anemia. "
"BACKGROUND: New topical treatments in scalp psoriasis are needed because many current topical treatments are disliked by patients and associated with poor compliance. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of once-daily, two-compound scalp formulation containing calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate with the individual components in the same vehicle and the vehicle alone. METHODS: In this 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study, patients with scalp psoriasis were randomized to treatment with the two-compound scalp formulation (calcipotriene 50 microg/g plus betamethasone 0.5 mg/g, as dipropionate) (n = 541), betamethasone 0.5 mg/g (as dipropionate) in the same vehicle (n = 556), calcipotriene 50 microg/g in the same vehicle (n = 272), or vehicle alone (n = 136). RESULTS: More patients achieved ""absent"" or ""very mild"" disease at week 8 with the two-compound scalp formulation (71.2%) compared with betamethasone dipropionate in the same vehicle (64.0%, p = .011), calcipotriene in the same vehicle (36.8%, p < .0001), or the vehicle (22.8%, p < .0001). LIMITATIONS: Efficacy of the active comparators in the study has not been established in relation to calcipotriene and betamethasone formulations available for clinical use. CONCLUSION: Calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate scalp formulation was more effective than either of the individual components or the vehicle alone. "
"BACKGROUND: Ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution 0.025% (reference formulation), a topical mast cell stabilizer/antihistamine combination, has been found to be effective and well tolerated in the prevention of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis (AC). A recently developed formulation of ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution 0.025% (test formulation) contains the same active ingredient in the same concentration as the reference formulation, is intended for twice-daily dosing, and may provide a treatment option in patients with AC. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the clinical bioequivalence of the test and reference formulations using a conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model. METHODS: This prospective, randomized, double-masked, active- and placebo-controlled CAC study was conducted in a clinical setting (ORA Clinical Research and Development, North Andover, Massachusetts). Patients aged <18 years who had AC, a successful allergen challenge during screening and allergen confirmation visits, a history of ocular allergies, and positive skin-test reactivity were enrolled. Patients' eyes were randomized to receive the test or reference formulation or inactive vehicle (1 drop of 1 study medication per eye per visit). The primary efficacy end point was ocular itching, and the secondary end points were ocular redness, chemosis, lid swelling, tearing, and mucous discharge. Efficacy was assessed following challenge at 8 hours and 15 minutes after instillation. The test and reference formulations were considered bioequivalent if the 95% CIs for the differences in mean ocular itching scores between the 2 groups were within the range of 0.40 to 0.40. RESULTS: There were 108 patients enrolled (61 men, 47 women; mean age, 42 years; 91.7% white). The test and reference formulations both yielded clinically significant results compared with placebo in the prevention of ocular itching at CACs performed 8 hours and 15 minutes after instillation. At the 8-hour posttreatment CAC, the mean ocular itching scores for test formulation-treated eyes were 1.158, 1.265, and 1.305 units lower, respectively, than for eyes at 3, 5, and 7 minutes that were administered placebo. At 15-minute posttreatment CAC, the mean ocular itching scores for reference formulation-treated eyes at 3, 5, and 7 minutes were 1.481, 1.622, and 1.565 units lower, respectively, than for eyes that were administered placebo. With regard to the primary and secondary efficacy variables, no statistically significant differences were observed between test and reference formulations at any post-CAC time point. CONCLUSIONS: In this population of patients with AC, the test formulation of ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution 0.025% met criteria for bioequivalence to the reference formulation, as established by the protocol. The test and reference formulations were well tolerated in the population studied. "
"Abstract: Formulating at acidic pH is a route to improve the chemical or biological stability and the performances of cosmeceuticals. Unfortunately, its potential is limited by the poor differentiation of available acidic agents, and by the risk of skin irritation. Recently, a perfluoropolyether phosphate was proposed to formulate acidic gels and emulsions, with advantages related with the specific active ingredient. The safety of these compositions, evaluated on volunteers, was the main objective of several studies. On the basis of these tests, and of its activity as O/W emulsifier, antimicrobial agent and oil repellent material, it can be asserted that perfluoropolyether phosphate widens the potential of acidic compositions regarding safety and functionality.

"Abstract: Ultraviolet (UV) solar radiation produces harmful effects on the skin including sunburn, local immunosuppression, skin photoaging, and cutaneous malignancies. Although application of sunscreens is the ""gold standard"" for protecting the skin from UV radiation, studies have shown that currently used sunscreens can cause adverse skin and systemic reactions, owing to their penetration into the viable cutaneous strata and to transdermal absorption. This paper presents new nonpermeating sunscreens (NPSUN) suitable for use in cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. The basic idea behind the design of the new photoprotectors was to immobilize UV-absorbing moieties in the Jojoba oil chemical backbone. The physicochemical characteristics of NPSUNs allow these derivatives to remain confined to the upper stratum corneum where the sunscreen molecule acts, with no further clearance to deeper dermal strata or systemic circulation. As an example, no permeation across the skin of methoxycinnamate-NPSUN was observed during 24-hour in vitro experiments, after topical application of either unformulated substances or of methoxycinnamate-NPSUNs formulated in oil-in-water cream, in water-in-oil cream, or in Jojoba oil. Another approach to increase the photoprotective effect against the UV radiation is targeting the delivery of alpha tocopherol into the deeper skin layers and across the cell membranes. This is necessary for optimal photoprotection and prevention of malignant processes. For this purpose, ethosomal vitamin E compositions were designed, characterized, and tested. Efficient intracellular and dermal accumulation of vitamin E from ethosomes was demonstrated. A good clinical strategy could be the use of NPSUNs during direct UV exposure followed by the application of alpha-tocopherol compositions after short- or long-term solar radiation. "
"Abstract: The aim of this investigation was to develop solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) from indigenous, natural solid lipids by using a simple microemulsion technique. Furthermore, the aim was to characterize these SLNs and evaluate its potential in the topical delivery of a lipophilic drug, tretinoin (TRN). The developed SLNs were characterized for particle size, polydispersity index, entrapment efficiency of TRN and morphology. TRN-loaded SLN-based topical gels were formulated and the gels were evaluated comparatively with the commercial product with respect to primary skin irritation, in vitro occlusivity and skin permeation. The results of the study showed mean particle size <100nm of the SLN dispersions with the novel lipids. Up to 46% of drug entrapment in the lipids was attained. Lesser skin irritancy, greater skin tolerance, occlusivity and slow drug release was observed with the developed TRN-loaded SLN-based gels than the commercial product. The research work could be concluded as successful production of SLNs using highly purified stearine fraction of natural solid lipids. The results of the characterization and evaluation established the safety for use, suitability and compatibility of indigenous natural lipids as a novel excipient. "
"BACKGROUND: Acute postoperative pain is common after most surgical procedures. Despite the availability of many analgesic options, postoperative pain management is often unsatisfactory. Purified capsaicin (ALGRX 4975 98% pure) has demonstrated prolong inhibition of C-fiber function in in vitro, preclinical, and clinical studies, and may be an effective adjunct to postoperative pain management. METHODS: We performed a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the analgesic efficacy of a single intraoperative wound instillation of 1000 microg ultrapurified capsaicin (ALGRX 4975) after open mesh groin hernia repair in 41 adult male patients. The primary end-point was average daily visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores during the first week after surgery assessed as area under the curve (AUC). Pain was recorded twice daily in a pain diary for 4 wk. Physical examination and laboratory tests were done before and 1 wk after surgery, together with recordings of adverse events up to 28 days. Adverse events were recorded. Data were also analyzed using a mixed-effects analysis with NONMEM. RESULTS: VAS AUC was significantly lower during the first 3 days postoperatively (P < 0.05), but not for the whole 1 or 4 wk postoperatively. Mixed-effects analysis with NONMEM revealed that pain scores were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the capsaicin group during the first 4 days. No clinically significant serious adverse events were observed, although a mild transient increase in liver enzymes was seen more often in the capsaicin-treated group. CONCLUSION: In the setting of a well-defined analgesic protocol standard, VAS AUC analysis and a mixed-effect analysis showed superior analgesia of capsaicin relative to placebo during the first 3-4 days after inguinal hernia repair.

"Abstract: Retinoids and the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid have shown anticancer properties, but the photocarcinogenic or photoprotective effect is unclear. Therefore, we investigated whether a topical formulation of valproic acid is photocarcinogenic or photoprotective in hairless female C3.Cg/TifBomTac immunocompetent mice exposed to simulated solar radiation (SSR) and whether valproic acid changes the effect of the retinoids: tazarotene and isotretinoin. The products were applied on the dorsal skin of 400 mice (five times weekly) followed by SSR (three times weekly) 3-4 h after the application. This was performed during 12 months or until death. Tumors appeared sooner in groups treated with tazarotene and isotretinoin compared with that of the group treated with valproic acid and the control group. The present study shows that valproic acid alone is not photocarcinogenic or photoprotective in hairless mice. When valproic acid is combined with tazarotene or isotretinoin, it does not change their photocarcinogenicity significantly. "
"BACKGROUND: Multiple modalities have been used in the treatment of melasma, such as bleaching agents, chemical peels, and antioxidants. Topical zinc sulfate has peeling and antioxidant effects. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical 10% zinc sulfate solution in the treatment of melasma. PATIENTS & METHODS: This study was conducted at the Department of Dermatology & Venereology, Baghdad Teaching Hospital. Twenty-eight patients with melasma were treated with 10% zinc sulfate solution. Every patient was instructed to apply the formula twice daily and to be seen every 2 weeks for 2 months. The severity of melasma was assessed before, during, and after treatment with the melasma area and severity index (MASI). All patients were instructed to apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF>30 before sun exposure during treatment and for the 3-month follow-up period. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were treated with 10% zinc sulfate solution. The mean MASI score before treatment was 9.45, which changed to 4.70 after therapy. This corresponds to a percentage improvement of 49.78% and was statistically significant (p<.0005). No side effects were reported apart from a mild stinging sensation reported in a few patients. Most patients maintained improvement 3 months after cessation of therapy. CONCLUSION: Topical 10% zinc sulfate solution is a new effective, safe, and noncostly formulation in the treatment of melasma. "
"Abstract: The safety of using otic formulations is often of concern for practitioners and pet owners alike, with ""safe"" in this context meaning no adrenocortical suppression. This study evaluated the effect of four glucocorticoid-containing otic formulations on plasma cortisol concentrations, measured by corticotropin stimulation testing (plasma cortisol concentrations before and after corticotropin injection), in dogs presented with otitis externa. Dexamethasone tended to have larger adrenocortical suppression compared with the other three formulations (betamethasone, triamcinolone, and mometasone), but the difference was not statistically significant. The largest difference among the four drugs was observed between dexamethasone and betamethasone (P=.09). "
"PURPOSE: The pharmacokinetics, benefits, risks, and future of transdermal drug products are reviewed. SUMMARY: Transdermal drug delivery capitalizes on an attractive route of drug delivery, as it avoids the need for painful i.v. drug administration, i.v. site access, and syringe disposal and is an option for drug delivery to patients who are unable to swallow oral medications. Specific transdermal drug designs have advantages and disadvantages, including the ability to alter the patch size or readily manipulate the products. Transdermal drug delivery systems currently available include drug reservoir and microreservoir membrane-modulated systems, drug-in-adhesive layer designs, and matrix patches. Maximizing patient response to transdermal drug formulations may also rely on a number of other practical concerns, including patient dexterity, dose reproducibility, storage and stability of the remaining portion, and decreased adhesive efficacy. Adhesives in transdermal precuts may be locally irritating, and prolonged use and high dosages have resulted in dermatological reactions to some patches. Patients may also develop contact sensitization or systemic sensitization to the transdermal formulation itself. When a transdermal product regimen is initiated, caregivers should be mindful of the product's primary features and educate patients accordingly, specifically addressing where and how to apply the patch, duration of patch use, and procedures for properly changing and storing patches. CONCLUSION: The increasing complexity of transdermal drug products, the growing number of medications available in such dosage forms, and reports of potential safety concerns contribute to the need for clinicians to understand the principles of transdermal drug delivery, safe usage techniques, and proper patient counseling points.

"Abstract: The efficacy and safety of adapalene 0.1% gel in the treatment of acne vulgaris has been demonstrated in multiple controlled clinical trials. A higher concentration formulation, adapalene 0.3% gel, has been developed to provide a broader range of treatment options for acne management. Phase 3 clinical studies have demonstrated the superior efficacy of adapalene 0.3% gel compared to adapalene 0.1% gel and its vehicle at the end of a 12-week treatment period. The goal of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety of adapalene 0.3% gel in subjects treated once daily for 52 weeks, with a secondary objective to evaluate long-term efficacy. Subjects 12 years of age or older (N=551) with acne vulgaris participated in a multicenter, open-label study of the long-term (up to 52 weeks) efficacy and safety of once-daily applications of adapalene 0.3% gel. Of those enrolled, 167 subjects completed 12 months of treatment. Expected signs and symptoms of local cutaneous irritation (erythema, dryness, scaling, and stinging/burning) were mostly mild or moderate, with mean tolerability scores below 1 (mild) at all time points for the parameters assessed. Treatment-related, dermatologic adverse events were experienced by 21% of subjects and dry skin, skin discomfort, and scaling were reported by 10.5%, 8.3% and 3.3% of subjects, respectively. Most of the adverse events reported occurred in the first quarter of treatment. Adverse events were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Subjects treated with adapalene 0.3% gel for 52 weeks achieved a >75% median reduction in total, inflammatory, and noninflammatory lesions in this open-label study by the end of the treatment period. Adapalene 0.3% gel was safe and effective in the long-term (up to 1 year) treatment of subjects with acne vulgaris. "
"Abstract: A variety of topical retinoids is available for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Selection of the appropriate treatment depends not only on efficacy but also on how well the patient can tolerate different formulations. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of daily adapalene 0.1% gel compared to daily tazarotene 0.1% cream and to demonstrate the noninferiority of adapalene 0.1% gel when compared to tazarotene 0.1% cream in treating acne. This represents 2 arms of a 3-arm study. Subjects 12 to 35 years of age with acne vulgaris (N=202) participated in a 12-week, randomized, evaluator-blinded study of once-daily therapy with adapalene 0.1% gel versus tazarotene 0.1% cream. The primary measure of efficacy was the reduction in total lesion counts posttreatment. Subjects treated with adapalene 0.1% gel achieved similar reductions in total lesion counts at week 12 compared to the subjects treated with the tazarotene cream, which demonstrates the noninferiority of adapalene treatment compared to tazarotene (median difference: -1.18%; lower confidence limit [LCL]: -9.26). At week 2, the number of patients that experienced erythema and scaling with tazarotene 0.1% cream was greater when compared to adapalene 0.1% gel and statistically significant. By week 12, the percentage of subjects reporting cutaneous irritation had returned to or near baseline levels and was similar between treatment arms for all parameters assessed. Adapalene gel was associated with fewer treatment-related adverse events than tazarotene cream (36% versus 58%, respectively), and less than half as many adverse events that were ""definitely"" related to study treatment than tazarotene cream (20% versus 45%, respectively). Daily therapy with adapalene 0.1% gel was shown to be noninferior to tazarotene 0.1% cream in total acne lesion reductions, and during initial stages of treatment, demonstrated better tolerability with respect to erythema and scaling. "
"Abstract: Treatment of acne vulgaris can be challenging for both patients and physicians. Topical retinoids are often considered first-line therapy for the treatment of all but the most severe forms of acne. A variety of formulations of topical retinoids, including adapalene and tazarotene, are available but tazarotene 0.1% gel is widely perceived to be the most efficacious. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a new, higher concentration of adapalene, adapalene 0.3% gel, compared to tazarotene 0.1% gel in the treatment of acne vulgaris. The primary efficacy outcome was the percent reduction in total lesion count at week 12. Subjects 12 to 35 years of age with acne vulgaris (N=172) participated in a 12-week, randomized, evaluator-blinded, noninferiority study of once-daily therapy with adapalene 0.3% gel or tazarotene 0.1% gel. Subjects in each group achieved clinically significant reductions in total lesion counts at week 12 (61% and 57% median reductions for adapalene and tazarotene, respectively); adapalene 0.3% gel was noninferior to tazarotene 0.1% gel (95% confidence interval [CI]: -5.2-9.6). The adapalene arm was also therapeutically similar to the tazarotene arm in terms of the percent reduction in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts at week 12, as well as in the assessments of acne severity and improvement. Mean tolerability scores for erythema, dryness, scaling, and stinging/burning were consistently lower in the adapalene arm compared to patients treated with tazarotene (P<.014 at week 12, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel [CMH] test). The worst score for any tolerability parameter in the treatment phase in the adapalene arm was less than 1 (mild). Adapalene was also associated with a lower incidence of treatment-related adverse events when compared to tazarotene (3.5% versus 14%, respectively). Once daily therapy with adapalene 0.3% gel provided similar efficacy (noninferior) to tazarotene 0.1% gel in the treatment of acne vulgaris, but demonstrated a superior tolerability profile. "
"Abstract: This office-based case series describes the use of a new formulation of benzoyl peroxide (BPO) delivered via a porous microsphere cream vehicle in patients with mild to moderate acne vulgaris. While BPO has been used for many years as antimicrobial in the treatment of acne, in recent years its use has been increasingly encouraged as part of a strategy designed to reduce Propionibacterium acnes (P acnes) resistance to antibiotics. Historically, a major drawback to BPO treatment has been irritation, which may be concentration-dependent or vehicle-dependent. A new BPO microsphere cream formulation has recently been introduced and appears to offer favorable efficacy with a very low potential for irritation. This article presents a series of patients from 2 private dermatologic practices treated with a new BPO microsphere cream formulation both as monotherapy and in combination with other acne drugs. "
"BACKGROUND: Benzoyl peroxide (BPO) is poorly soluble. A solubilized formulation of BPO has been developed to maximize its bioavailability and enhance follicular penetration. METHODS: Patients with acne vulgaris were randomly assigned to receive solubilized BPO 5% gel on one side of the face and a BPO 5%/clindamycin 1% combination product on the contralateral side, twice daily for 4 weeks. RESULTS: Of 23 patients enrolled, 100% completed the study. Reductions in lesion count with the solubilized BPO gel were at least as great as with BPO/clindamycin--and significantly greater (P< or =.05) for noninflammatory lesions at week 1 and inflammatory lesions at week 4. Both regimens were generally well tolerated and patient satisfaction was comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Solubilized BPO 5% gel monotherapy offers significantly greater efficacy, and comparable patient satisfaction, compared with BPO/clindamycin. The early reduction in lesion counts observed with the solubilized BPO gel in the absence of an antibiotic is clinically relevant. "
"BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves the activation of a photosensitizer by visible light to produce activated oxygen species within target cells, resulting in their destruction. Evidence-based guidelines support the efficacy of PDT using topical 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA-PDT) in actinic keratoses, Bowen disease and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Efficacy for nodular BCC appears inferior to that for superficial BCC unless prior debulking or repeat treatments are performed. Objectives The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of adding a novel iron-chelating agent, CP94 (1,2-diethyl-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one hydrochloride), to topical ALA, to temporarily increase the accumulation of the photosensitizer in the tumour. METHODS: A mixed topical formulation of ALA + increasing concentrations of CP94 was used to carry out PDT on previously biopsied nodular BCC with no prior lesion preparation using standard light delivery. The area was assessed clinically and surgically excised 6 weeks later for histological examination. RESULTS: Enhanced PDT using 40% CP94 resulted in significantly greater clearance rates in nodular BCC than with ALA-PDT alone, in our protocol of single-treatment PDT with no lesion preparation. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate the safe and effective use of an enhanced ALA-PDT protocol for nodular BCC using CP94, with no adverse reactions to this modification. This is the first time this formulation has been used in patients. This formulation is now the focus of further study. "
"Abstract: An aqueous gel formulation containing solubilized clindamycin phosphate 1.2% and a stable combination of both solubilized and crystalline tretinoin 0.025% (clin/tret) has been evaluated in 3 pivotal phase 3 studies, among other studies including a 52-week trial. The pivotal studies enrolled 4550 participants 12 years and older with mild, moderate, and severe acne vulgaris. The combination clin/tret gel was effective in reducing both inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions and was well-tolerated. This article reviews important vehicle characteristics of the combination gel as well as formulation stability and tolerability data that are potentially clinically relevant. "
"Abstract: Cosmetic formulations may contain nano-emulsions and microscopic vesicles consisting of traditional cosmetic materials, although it is uncertain whether they should be qualified as actual nanomaterials. Vesicle materials do not penetrate into living human skin. Vesicle formulations may enhance or reduce skin absorption of ingredients, albeit at a limited scale. Sunscreens contain TiO2 or ZnO nanoparticles (NP), which are efficient UV filters. A number of studies suggest that insoluble NP do not penetrate into or through human skin. The results of in vivo toxicity tests showed that TiO2 and ZnO NP are non-toxic. In vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, photogenotoxicity, acute toxicity, sensitisation and ecotoxicology studies on TiO2 NP found no difference in the safety profile of micro- or nano-sized materials, all of which were non-toxic. Although some in vitro investigations on TiO2 particles reported cell uptake, oxidative cell damage or genotoxicity, these results may be secondary to phagocytosis of cells exposed to excessive particle concentrations. Studies on wear debris nano- and microparticles support the traditional view that toxicity of small particles is related to their chemistry, rather than their particle size. There is little evidence supporting a general rule that adverse effects of particles on the skin or other tissues increase with smaller particle size, or produce novel toxicities relative to those of larger particles. Overall, the current evidence suggests that nano-sized cosmetic or sunscreen ingredients pose no potential risk to human health, whereas their use in sunscreens has large benefits, such as the protection of human skin against skin cancer. "
"Abstract: The objective of this study was to evaluate formulations containing adenosine to reduce periorbital lines and glabellar frowns in a blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study. One hundred twenty-six female volunteers between 45 and 65 years of age fulfilled inclusion criteria for periorbital lines. They were provided with two of three products (cream with adenosine, dissolvable film with adenosine or placebo), to be applied to the periorbital area on each side of the face (84 subjects per product). Eighty-four of these subjects also fulfilled the inclusion criteria for glabellar frowns, and received placebo or cream with adenosine to be applied to the glabellar area. Products were applied twice daily for 2 months, and evaluation was performed under dermatological supervision at 0, 3 and 8 weeks using Fast Optical in vivo Topometry of human Skin (FOITS) analysis to describe skin profile. Both adenosine-containing products led to significant improvements in skin smoothness in the periorbital area. Improvements were evidenced after 3 weeks of product application as measured by Ra and Rz parameters using the FOITS technique, and were steadily confirmed after 2 months, despite severe climatic conditions and independently of the analysis technique that was used with the FOITS data. Adenosine-containing cream also significantly improved glabellar frowns. This study demonstrates the potential beneficial effects of adenosine-containing products on crow's feet and glabellar facial wrinkles. "
"Abstract: The immunogenicity and efficacy of three inactivated vaccines (A, B, C) prepared with Mycoplasma agalactiae (M. agalactiae) and with different oil-emulsion adjuvants were evaluated in sheep. Twenty-eight animals were used, divided into four groups (a, b, c, d) of seven animals each. Three groups were immunized with the same vaccine, but using different adjuvants, while one group (d) was used as an unvaccinated control group. All the vaccine formulations were able to induce clinical protection of animals after challenge with M. agalactiae, but only vaccine C, emulsioned with Montanide ISA-563, Marcol-52 and Montane-80 (ratio: 30%, 63%, 7% respectively), was able to induce full protection in challenged animals, preventing both the onset of clinical signs and infection by M. agalactiae.

"Abstract: The purpose of the present study was to develop and design pectin and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) blended hydrogel membranes (PEVP), with different pectin: PVP ratios (1:0.2, 1:0.4, 1:0.6, 1:0.8 and 1:1 w/w), which were prepared by using a conventional solution casting technique. An attempt has been made to characterize the hydrogel membranes by various instrumental techniques like, FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), tensile strength test and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The release patterns of the drug (salicylic acid) from the hydrogel membrane were done in three different release mediums (pH 1.4, pH 7.4 and distilled water) and samples were analyzed spectrophotometrically at 294 nm wavelength on a UV Vis spectrophotometer. MTT assay was done to ensure cytocompatibility of the pectin/PVP hydrogel membranes using B16 melanoma cells. FTIR spectroscopy indicated the presence of secondary amide (I) absorption bands. The XRD study shows decrease in crystallinity of the hydrogel membranes with increase in PVP ratio. DSC study shows an increase in T(g) of pectin after blending with PVP. It was found that tensile strength increases with increasing PVP ratios in the hydrogel membranes. The prepared hydrogel membranes were found to be biocompatible with B16 melanoma cells. "
"Abstract: Benzoyl peroxide (BPO) has been an important component of the acne treatment armamentarium for decades. A number of characteristics contribute to its success in acne, including its lipophilicity, potent antibacterial activity, and ability to suppress antibiotic-resistant strains of Propionibacterium acnes. With some commercially available products in which BPO comprises crystals in suspension, aggregation of BPO can occur on the skin surface in large clumps, resulting in poor penetration of sebaceous follicles. In addition, the poor water solubility of BPO, coupled with its chemical instability in other solvents, presents challenges with respect to formulating topical products with optimal bioavailability, stability, and tolerability. Several products and vehicle systems have evolved in attempts to improve on the benefits of BPO in treating acne. A new acne treatment has been developed that contains 5% solubilized BPO consisting of small-size particles. This new product exhibits enhanced follicular penetration of BPO, improved P acnes kill rates and clinical efficacy, and good consumer acceptance relative to existing formulations. "
"Abstract: Topical antimicrobial agents are commonly used as first-line agents for the management of mild to moderate acne vulgaris. Agents with antibacterial activity (eg, benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin), reduce counts of Propionibacterium acnes, while also decreasing the numbers of inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions. In order to optimize efficacy, topical antibiotics are most commonly used in combination with benzoyl peroxide, an approach which also reduces the emergence of strains of P acnes that are less sensitive to antibiotics. Other topical antiacne options include retinoids (with or without an antimicrobial agent), sulfacetamide, sulfacetamide-sulfur, and azelaic acid. Certain formulations of benzoyl peroxide offer improved tolerability, while a new micronized form may enhance efficacy by optimizing follicular penetration. This wide array of options allows dermatologists to tailor topical treatments to the needs of individual patients. "
"OBJECTIVE: Deximune soft-gelatin capsules (Dexcel Ltd., Hadera, Israel), the test preparation and Sandimmun Neoral (Novartis Inc., Basel, Switzerland), the reference preparation, are two cyclosporine (CyA) formulations widely used after stem cells and solid organ transplantation. A post-marketing, retrospective, parallel, comparative, multicenter survey study in transplant patients receiving these two formulations after transplantation was carried out in order to compare the toxicity profile and bioavailability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted in the five main leading transplantation centers in Israel and included 174 patients. A total of 1-3 CyA serum levels at different periods after transplantation were measured in each subject and the bioavailability, efficacy and toxicity profile were assessed. The blood concentrations were compared using a statistical model after adjustment for type of transplantation, dose and time after transplantation as confounding factors. RESULTS: No distinct differences were observed between the two CyA formulations. Using model-derived least squares means (LSM) of the CyA blood levels and adjusting for relevant confounding factors, no significant difference could be found between the blood levels of the test and reference formulations. Most of the side effects were mild and transient with both formulations, whereas 23% of the patients reported serious adverse events (mainly hypertension, 15%). 20% of the patients developed infectious complications during the therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Deximune administration is safe. The toxicity profile of the product, incidence and type of side effects and bioavailability are similar to those of Sandimmun Neoral. "
"Abstract: An improved formulation of the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) in combination with the hydrophilic polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was investigated for its potential clinical applications in fluorescence diagnosis and photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer. This study reports the comparative preclinical biodistribution and efficacy of Ce6 delivered with or without PVP versus dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The safety and fluorescence pharmacokinetics of Ce6-PVP in humans was also accessed. Biodistribution results showed that Ce6-PVP had higher tumor to normal tissue ratio compared to the other formulations. The sensitivity and specificity derived from the area under the receiver operating characteristics curves showed that the formulations were able to discriminate tumor from peritumoral muscle in the following order: Ce6-PVP > Ce6 > Ce6-DMSO. In vitro PDT results showed that Ce6-PVP was found to induce selective phototoxicity in leukemic cells compared to peripheral mononuclear blood cells. In addition, in vivo light irradiation at 1h after Ce6-PVP was found to induce greater tumor necrosis without causing animal toxicity. In patients, preferential accumulation of Ce6-PVP was observed in angiosarcoma lesions compared to normal skin following intravenous administration. In conclusion, PVP significantly enhanced the Ce6 concentration in tumors compared with Ce6 alone and increased the therapeutic index of PDT without any side effects in animal model. No serious adverse events were observed in human as well. "
"Abstract: Topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, and topical and oral antibiotics remain the milestone of treatment for mild to moderate acne vulgaris. Oral isotretinoin is useful for the treatment of severe nodular acne, treatment-resistant acne, and acne with a risk of physical or psychological scarring. Hormonal treatment in female acne is useful in resistant or late-onset acne. With increasing concerns regarding teratogenicity of isotretinoin and increasing antibiotic resistance, there is a clear need for therapeutic alternatives to these long-used treatments. Research in the pathogenesis of acne has allowed for new therapies and future perspectives regarding acne to evolve. They include low-dose long-term isotretinoin regimens, insulin-sensitizing agents, 5alpha-reductase type 1 inhibitors, topical photodynamic therapy, new combination formulations, dietary interventions, and antiinflammatory agents such as lipoxygenase inhibitors. "
"Abstract: Topical photodynamic therapy with 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is a newly established treatment modality for epithelial skin cancer. Skin distribution of different 20% 5-ALA formulations was investigated by detection of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) using an ex vivo porcine skin model. Fluorescence of PpIX was first detectable at 2 h after application of a 5-ALA/HCl-alcohol solution, followed by a 5-ALA gel +/- 40% DMSO > 5-ALA lipophilic ointment > 5-ALA hydrophilic ointment at 4 h after application. Intensity of PpIX was 10-fold higher after 5-ALA/HCl-alcohol application in contrast to 5-ALA hydrophilic ointment. Maxima of PpIX fluorescence were measured between 18 and 24 h after application. PpIX accumulation induced by 5-ALA within the lower parts of the epidermis was increased in order of 5-ALA hydrophilic ointment < 5-ALA lipophilic ointment < 5-ALA gel w/o DMSO < 5-ALA gel with DMSO < 5-ALA/HCl-alcohol. Illumination of skin incubated with different 5-ALA formulations led to a marked increase of apoptotic cells in the epidermis depending on the penetration depth of the 5-ALA formulations. A formulation containing short chain alcohols have been observed to increase the permeation and distribution of 5-ALA. PpIX fluorescence was detected earlier yielding to photodynamic effective amounts of PpIX in the epidermis as compared with all other 5-ALA formulations used. These data emphasizes the potential of investigating properties of new formulations using such a full thickness porcine skin model. "
"BACKGROUND: Hydrocortisone butyrate (HCB) is currently marketed as a cream, ointment, and solution. A new lotion formulation of hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1% (Locoid lotion) has been developed and evaluated. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HCB 0.1% lotion compared to the vehicle in subjects aged 3 months to less than 18 years with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD). METHODS: In this multicenter double-blind study, 284 subjects with mild to moderate AD were randomized 1:1 to receive HCB 0.1% lotion or the vehicle for a duration of 4 weeks. ""Treatment success"" was defined as those subjects with a final Physician Global Assessment (PGA) score of 0 or 1 that had at least a 2-point reduction in the PGA score from baseline to day 29. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events. RESULTS: Analyses of the final PGA score showed a significant treatment effect (P <.001) in favor of the HCB 0.1% lotion group. The safety profile of the HCB 0.1% lotion was also favorable. LIMITATIONS: The study did not assess the durability of the treatment effects (ie, safety and efficacy) after completion of the 4-week treatment period nor the potential need for longer term therapy given the chronic nature of AD. CONCLUSION: Results demonstrate the safety and efficacy of HCB 0.1% lotion in the treatment of mild to moderate AD in children 3 months to 18 years of age. "
"Abstract: The nose is innervated with both odor responsive olfactory (cranial nerve I) and irritant responsive trigeminal (cranial nerve V) nerves. The nature and extent of any interactions between these two nerves is poorly understood. The aim of the current study was to determine if two sulfur-containing malodorants, ethyl sulfide and t-butyl sulfide, modulated responsiveness to the trigeminal C fiber stimulant capsaicin using female C57Bl/6J mice as an experimental model. Cessation or marked slowing of flow at the onset of each expiration (termed braking) was used as a biomarker for trigeminal nerve stimulation. Aerosolized capsaicin solution (100 microg/ml) increased the time of braking from baseline levels of 8 ms to an average of 69 ms. At an exposure concentration of 100 ppm the malodorants induced only a minimal time of braking response (< 35 ms); the time of braking response in animals exposed to either malodorant plus capsaicin was 2.5-fold greater than in animals exposed to capsaicin alone (p < 0.01). In a subsequent experiment the time of breaking response to capsaicin was doubled (281 vs. 146 ms) by concomitant exposure to a no effect level of ethyl sulfide (11 ppm) and the modulation of capsaicin responsiveness was nearly abolished by inclusion of the adenosine antagonist theophylline in the aerosol formulation (time of braking 184 ms, p > or = 0.05 compared with capsaicin alone). These results suggest trigeminal nerve responsiveness is enhanced by exposure to malodorants through a theophylline-sensitive paracrine signaling pathway between olfactory and trigeminal nerves. "
"BACKGROUND: Chemical peeling by salicylic acid in ethanol or another vehicle may be accompanied by stinging and burning followed by postinflammatory hyperpigmentation in the treated area, or salicylism. We have developed a new formulation: 30% salicylic acid in polyethylene glycol (SA-PEG). A topical application of SA-PEG remodels photodamaged skin in mice and humans, without systemic absorption. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SA-PEG for clinical use in the treatment of acne. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the effects of the preparation histologically in mice and its safety and efficacy in 44 volunteers with normally aged skin and in 436 patients with acne. RESULTS: Histologic studies in animals showed no inflammatory changes in the skin following topical application of SA-PEG. Volunteers noted an improved skin texture. In the acne patients, the comedones and papules disappeared, resulting in an excellent outcome. There was a notable absence of stinging and burning, edema, bleeding, or crusting in the treated area. CONCLUSION: The SA-PEG preparation appeared to be safe and effective, with minimal associated inflammation or adverse effects, even in Asian patients who tend to develop hyperpigmentation or keloids. This preparation is thus ideal for chemical peeling. "
"BACKGROUND: The use of pentane-1,5-diol in topical pharmaceutical products is relatively new compared with, e.g., propane-1,2-diol (propylene glycol), also an aliphatic diol, which has been used for many years. Yet, what are the differences between diols in clinical efficacy, safety and other characteristics? OBJECTIVE: The objective of this overview was to compare the efficacy, safety, chemical and pharmaceutical characteristics of pentane-1,5-diol with other aliphatic diols used in pharmaceutical formulations in dermatology. METHODS: A survey of the literature was carried out based on searches limited to aliphatic diols. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Pentane-1,5-diol was found to be safe and more effective than several other diols with respect to drug delivery-enhancing potency, pharmaceutical and cosmetic properties, antimicrobial spectrum and toxicity. Results from formal clinical trials with pentane-1,5-diol verify its efficacy and safety. These characteristics together with its low cost make pentane-1,5-diol an attractive substance for use in pharmaceutical formulations for topical administration. "
"BACKGROUND: Psychostimulants remain the most-used medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The methylphenidate transdermal system (MTS) is the first stimulant patch dosage formulation to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of the symptoms of ADHD in children aged 6 to 12 years. The MTS patch is approved to be applied once daily to the hip and worn for 9 hours. While cutaneous reactions may occur with any formulation of medication, they are more likely with transdermal administration. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this commentary was to describe the types of cutaneous reactions that have been reported with transdermal systems in general, review the cutaneous adverse events seen in clinical trials with the MTS specifically, and provide practical management suggestions for prevention and treatment of these potential cutaneous reactions. METHODS: In September 2007, a group of child psychiatrists, pediatricians, developmental pediatricians, and pediatric neurologists who treat ADHD and have had experience in their practices with MTS convened to discuss cutaneous reactions in relation to its use. Information collected from this meeting and from the clinical trials database of the sponsor was reviewed by a panel of 3 dermatologic clinical experts in contact dermatitis and 1 pediatric dermatologist. The panel's recommendations form the basis for this report. CONCLUSIONS: Mild to moderate erythema is a common cutaneous effect with MTS use, and is generally not a cause for discontinuation if seen in isolation. Irritant contact dermatitis is relatively common and can be reduced and treated by alternating patch application sites, moisturizing, gentle skin care, and application of topical corticosteroids at the previous patch sites if needed. Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) and allergic contact urticaria are rare when MTS is worn as directed in the prescribing information. MTS should be discontinued if ACD is suspected. "
"UNLABELLED: Chemotherapeutic agents give rise to numerous well described adverse effects that may affect the skin, hair, mucous membranes, or nails. The mucocutaneous effects of longstanding agents have been extensively studied and reviewed. Over the last 2 decades, a number of new molecular entities for the treatment of cancer have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This article reviews the cutaneous toxicity patterns of these agents. It also reviews one drug that has not received FDA approval but is in use outside the United States and is important dermatologically. Particular emphasis is placed on the novel signal transduction inhibitors as well as on newer literature pertaining to previously described reactions. LEARNING OBJECTIVES: At the completion of this learning activity, participants should able to list the newer chemotherapeutic agents that possess significant mucocutaneous side effects and describe the range of reactions that are seen with each drug. In addition, they should be able to formulate appropriate management strategies for these reactions. "
"Abstract: This study was designed to determine the genotoxic effects of visible (400-800nm) and ultraviolet A (UVA)/visible (315-800nm) lights on human keratinocytes and CHO cells. The alkaline comet assay was used to quantify DNA-damage. In addition, photo-dependent cytogenetic lesions were assessed in CHO cells by the micronucleus test. Three protective compounds [ectoin, l-ergothioneine (ERT) and mannitol] were tested with the comet assay for their effectiveness to reduce DNA single-strand breaks (SSB). Finally, the genomic photoprotections of two broad-band sunscreens and their tinted analogues were assessed by the comet assay. The WST-1 cytotoxicity assay revealed a decrease of the keratinocyte viability of 30% and 13% for the highest UVA/visible and visible irradiations (15 and 13.8J/cm(2), respectively). Visible as well as UVA/visible lights induced DNA SSB and micronuclei, in a dose-dependent manner. The level of DNA breakage induced by visible light was 50% of the one generated by UVA/visible irradiation. However, UVA radiations were 10 times more effective than visible radiations to produce SSB. The DNA lesions induced by visible and UVA/visible lights were reduced after a 1-h preincubation period with the three tested compounds. The maximal protective effects were 92.7%, 97.9% and 52.0% for ectoin (0.1mM), ERT (0.5mM) and mannitol (1.5mM), respectively, against visible light and 68.9%, 59.8% and 62.7% for ectoin (0.1mM), ERT (0.5mM) and mannitol (1.5mM), respectively, against UVA/visible light. Thus, visible light was genotoxic on human keratinocytes and CHO cells through oxidative stress mechanisms similar to the ones induced by UVA radiations. The four tested sunscreens efficiently prevented DNA lesions that were induced by both visible and UVA/visible irradiations. The tinted sunscreens were slightly more effective that their colorless analogues. There is a need to complement sunscreen formulations with additional molecules to obtain a complete internal and external photoprotection against both UVA and visible lights. "
"Abstract: Topical photodynamic therapy (PDT) with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is an alternative therapy for many non-melanoma skin cancers. The major limitation of this therapy, however, is the low permeability of ALA through the stratum corneum (SC) of the skin. The objective of the present work was to characterize ethosomes containing ALA and to enhance the skin production of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), compared to traditional liposomes. Results showed that the average particle sizes of the ethosomes were less than those of liposomes. Moreover, the entrapment efficiency of ALA in the ethosome formulations was 8-66% depending on the surfactant added. The particle size of the ethosomes was still approximately <200 nm after 32 days of storage. An in vivo animal study observed the presence of PpIX in the skin by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The results indicated that the penetration ability of ethosomes was greater than that of liposomes. The enhancements of all the formulations were ranging from 11- to 15-fold in contrast to that of control (ALA in an aqueous solution) in terms of PpIX intensity. In addition, colorimetry detected no erythema in the irradiated skin. The results demonstrated that the enhancement ratio of ethosome formulations did not significantly differ between the non-irradiated and irradiated groups except for PE/CH/SS, which may have been due to a photobleaching effect of the PDT-irradiation process. "
"Abstract: Tacrolimus gained FDA approval for use in liver transplantation in 1994 and, approximately 3 years later, was approved for the prevention of acute rejection in kidney transplantation. Over the last decade tacrolimus has become the calcineurin inhibitor of choice for the prevention of rejection in renal transplantation. The objective of this study was to provide a review and update of the literature on the use of tacrolimus in renal transplantation. Numerous clinical trials have shown tacrolimus to be superior to cyclosporine in the prevention of acute rejection and recent trials have demonstrated superiority of tacrolimus over cyclosporine in terms of allograft survival. Post-transplant diabetes remains more common with tacrolimus than cyclosporine, despite lower doses of both tacrolimus and corticosteroids. A novel once-daily dosage form of tacrolimus has recently been developed and is approved for use in Europe. Tacrolimus remains an important immunosuppressant for the prevention of acute rejection. The prolonged-release formulation may improve compliance and possibly long-term outcomes. "
"Abstract: Glyceryl Dilaurate, Glyceryl Diarachidate, Glyceryl Dibehenate, Glyceryl Dierucate, Glyceryl Dihydroxystearate, Glyceryl Diisopalmitate, Glyceryl Diisostearate, Glyceryl Dilinoleate, Glyceryl Dimyristate, Glyceryl Dioleate, Glyceryl Diricinoleate, Glyceryl Dipalmitate, Glyceryl Dipalmitoleate, Glyceryl Distearate, Glyceryl Palmitate Lactate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Glyceryl Stearate Lactate, and Glyceryl Stearate Succinate are diacylglycerols (also known as diglycerides or glyceryl diesters) that function as skin conditioning agents - emollients in cosmetics. Only Glyceryl Dilaurate (up to 5%), Glyceryl Diisostearate (up to 43%), Glyceryl Dioleate (up to 2%), Glyceryl Distearate (up to 7%), and Glyceryl Stearate Lactate (up to 5%) are reported to be in current use. Production proceeds from fully refined vegetable oils, which are further processed using hydrogenation and fractionation techniques, and the end products are produced by reacting selected mixtures of the partly hydrogenated, partly fractionated oils and fats with vegetable-derived glycerine to yield partial glycerides. In the final stage of the production process, the products are purified by deodorization, which effectively removes pesticide residues and lower boiling residues such as residues of halogenated solvents and aromatic solvents. Diglycerides have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as indirect food additives. Nominally, these ingredients are 1,3-diglycerides, but are easily isomerized to the 1,2-diglycerides form. The 1,3-diglyceride isomer is not a significant toxicant in acute, short-term, subchronic, or chronic animal tests. Glyceryl Dilaurate was a mild primary irritant in albino rabbits, but not a skin sensitizer in guinea pig maximization tests. Diacylglycerol Oil was not genotoxic in the Ames test, in mammalian Chinese hamster lung cells, or in a rodent bone marrow micronucleus assay. An eye shadow containing 1.5% Glyceryl Dilaurate did not induce skin irritation in a single insult patch test, but mild skin irritation reactions to a foundation containing the same concentration were observed. A trade mixture containing an unspecified concentration of Glyceryl Dibehenate did not induce irritation or significant cutaneous intolerance in a 48-h occlusive patch test. In maximization tests, neither an eye shadow nor a foundation containing 1.5% Glyceryl Dilaurate was a skin sensitizer. Sensitization was not induced in subjects patch tested with 50% w/w Glyceryl Dioleate in a repeated insult, occlusive patch test. Glyceryl Palmitate Lactate (50% w/v) did not induce skin irritation or sensitization in subjects patch tested in a repeat-insult patch test. Phototoxicity or photoallergenicity was not induced in healthy volunteers tested with a lipstick containing 1.0% Glyceryl Rosinate. Two diacylglycerols, 1-oleoyl-2-acetoyl-sn-glycerol and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol, did not alter cell proliferation (as determined by DNA synthesis) in normal human dermal fibroblasts in vitro at doses up to 10 microg/ml. In the absence of initiation, Glyceryl Distearate induced a moderate hyperplastic response in randomly bred mice of a tumor-resistant strain, and with 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene (DMBA) initiation, an increase in the total cell count was observed. In a glyceryl monoester study, a single application of DMBA to the skin followed by 5% Glyceryl Stearate twice weekly produced no tumors, but slight epidermal hyperplasia at the site of application. Glyceryl Dioleate induced transformation in 3-methylcholanthrene-initiated BALB/3T3 A31-1-1 cloned cells in vitro. A tumor-promoting dosing regimen that consisted of multiple applications of 10 mumol of a 1,2-diacylglycerol (sn-1,2-didecanoylglycerol) to female mice twice daily for 1 week caused more than a 60% decrease in protein kinase C (PKC) activity and marked epidermal hyperplasia. Applications of 10 micromol sn-1,2-didecanoylglycerol twice weekly for 1 week caused a decrease in cytosolic PKC activity, an increase in particulate PKC activity, and no epidermal hyperplasia. In studies of the tumor-promoting activity of 1,2-diacylglycerols, dose and the exposure regimen by which the dose is delivered play a role in tumor promotion. The 1,2-diacylglycerol-induced activation of PKC may also relate to the saturation of the fatty acid in the 1 or 2 position; 1,2-Diacylglycerols with two saturated fatty acids are less effective. Also, the activity of 1,2-diacylglycerols may be reduced when the fatty acid moiety in the structure is a long-chain fatty acid. A histological evaluation was performed on human skin from female volunteers (18 to 56 years old) who had applied a prototype lotion or placebo formulation, both containing 0.5% Glyceryl Dilaurate, consecutively for 16 weeks or 21 weeks. Skin irritation was not observed in any of the subjects tested. Biopsies (2 mm) taken from both legs of five subjects indicated no recognizable abnormalities of the skin; the epidermis was normal in thickness, and there was no evidence of scaling, inflammation, or neoplasms in any of the tissues that were evaluated. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel considered that the available safety test data indicate that diglycerides in the 1,3-diester form do not present any significant acute toxicity risk, nor are these ingredients irritating, sensitizing, or photosensitizing. Whereas no data are available regarding reproductive or developmental toxicity, there is no reason to suspect any such toxicity because the dermal absorption of these chemicals is negligible. The Panel noted that these nominally 1,3-diglycerides contain 1,2-diglycerides, raising the concern that 1,2-diglycerides could potentially induce hyperplasia. Data regarding the induction of PKC and the tumor promotion potential of 1,2-diacylglycerols increased the level of concern. Most of the diglycerides considered in this safety assessment, however, have fatty acid chains longer than 14 carbons and none have mixed saturated/unsaturated fatty acid moieties. The Panel considered it particularly important that a 21-week use study of a prototype lotion containing 0.5% Glyceryl Dilaurate (a 14-carbon chain fatty acid) indicated no evidence of scaling, inflammation, or neoplasms in biopsy specimens. Also, DNA synthesis assays on Glyceryl Dilaurate and Glyceryl Distearate indicated that neither chemical altered cell proliferation (as determined by DNA synthesis) in normal human dermal fibroblasts in vitro at doses up to 10 microg/ml. The Panel understands that use testing is a common practice in industry and, if histopathology data are collected, the Panel believes that such an approach can demonstrate an absence of epidermal hyperplasia. Because the concentration of these ingredients can vary (up to 43% for Glyceryl Diisostearate in lipstick), the frequency of application can be several times daily, and the proportion of diglycerides that are inactive 1,3 isomers versus potentially biologically active 1,2 isomers is unknown, the Panel believes that each use should be examined to ensure the absence of epidermal hyperplasia during product development and testing. In the absence of inhalation toxicity data on the Glyceryl Diesters in this safety assessment, the Panel determined that these ingredients can be used safely in aerosolized products because they are not respirable. The Panel recognizes that certain ingredients in this group are reportedly used in a given product category, but the concentration of use is not available. For other ingredients in this group, information regarding use concentration for specific product categories is provided, but the number of such products is not known. In still other cases, an ingredient is not in current use, but may be used in the future. Although there are gaps in knowledge about product use, the overall information available on the types of products in which these ingredients are used and at what concentration indicate a pattern of use. Within this overall pattern of use, the CIR Expert Panel considers all ingredients in this group to be safe. "
"BACKGROUND: DNA damage as a result of ultraviolet (UV) exposure plays an important role in the progression of cutaneous aging. Both folic acid and creatine have been linked to the process of DNA protection and repair. AIMS: This study aims to investigate the effects of a commercially available folic acid- and creatine-containing formulation to fight the clinical signs of premature skin aging. PATIENTS/METHODS: Both in vitro and in vivo home-in-use studies using a folic acid- and creatine-containing formulation were performed aiming to elucidate the efficacy in terms of improvement of skin regeneration, protection from UV-induced DNA damage (Comet assay), reduction of wrinkle volume, and skin visco-elasticity. Furthermore, clinical evaluation and photography were carried out to determine the improvement of clinically graded parameters after treatment. RESULTS: Cultured full-thickness epidermal skin models supplemented with folic acid and creatine after epithelial perturbation showed an accelerated skin regeneration compared to untreated control models. Similarly, application of a folic acid- and creatine-containing formulation significantly improved epidermal turnover in vivo as evidenced by smaller corneocytes derived from the treated sites relative to the vehicle-treated sides. In addition, topical in vivo application of this formulation significantly protected from UV-induced DNA lesions, increased skin firmness, and reduced wrinkle volume compared to untreated control areas. Expert grading confirmed a significant decrease of fine and coarse wrinkles in the periocular region as well as overall wrinkles, tactile roughness, and laxity. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results show that the combination of folic acid and creatine significantly accelerates epidermal skin regeneration in vitro and in vivo. Together with the finding of improved biomechanical skin properties, we conclude that the described topical formulation provides an effective treatment option for (photo)-aged skin. "
"Abstract: Several systemic drugs are available for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, including photochemotherapy, retinoids, cyclosporin, methotrexate, and fumarates. Although these options have been shown to maintain efficacy, frequently they produce significant subjective side effects. Recently, there has been a significant advance in developing newer medications that may be used for psoriasis. The progress in laboratory techniques has improved our understanding of the immuno-pathogenesis of psoriasis to a point where a number of key cytokines and immune cells--notably tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and T-cells respectively have been identified as critical factors contributing to the immuno-pathogenesis of the disease. Many of these medications are termed ""biologic response modifiers"" or, more commonly, ""biologicals"". The latter are a set of different engineered proteins designed to modify defined patho-physiological pathways that regulate pivotal immunological processes such as lymphocytes activation and cytokines production. New strategies and new formulation of biologic therapies, angiogenesis inhibition, immunomodulatory compounds, intracellular messenger targets, are of current interest to dermatologists and medicinal chemists. This review summarizes the current understanding of the immuno-pathogenesis of psoriasis, the mechanism of action and efficacy of current biologic therapies, new patents and their possible future applications in the treatment of psoriasis.

"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of a disintegrating tablet of ondansetron (ODT) and the conventional tablet formulation of ondansetron (OT) in controlling nausea and vomiting in breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 134 breast cancer patients receiving high-dose epirubicin participated in a randomized trial comparing the antiemetic efficacy and safety of an 8 mg OT given twice daily to an 8 mg orally ODT given twice daily, both for 3 days. RESULTS: OT was significantly better in the complete control of emesis (72% versus 52%, p=0.020) and marginally better in the complete control of nausea (66% versus 48%, p=0.054) induced by high-dose epirubicin over days 1-3 compared to ODT. However, no differences were found in major control of emesis (0 to 2 emetic episodes, 76% versus 70%, p=0.28) over days 1-3. CONCLUSION: OT was significantly better in the complete control of emesis and marginally better in the complete control of nausea, but not in the major control of emesis and nausea induced by high-dose epirubicin compared to ODT. ODT may be an effective alternative to OT, particularly in patients who have difficulties in swallowing a conventional tablet. "
"Abstract: As the production of nanoparticles of ZnO, TiO2 and CuO is increasing, their (eco)toxicity to bacteria Vibrio fischeri and crustaceans Daphnia magna and Thamnocephalus platyurus was studied with a special emphasis on product formulations (nano or bulk oxides) and solubilization of particles. Our innovative approach based on the combination of traditional ecotoxicology methods and metal-specific recombinant biosensors allowed to clearly differentiate the toxic effects of metal oxides per se and solubilized metal ions. Suspensions of nano and bulk TiO2 were not toxic even at 20 g l(-1). All Zn formulations were very toxic: L(E)C50 (mg l(-1)) for bulk ZnO, nanoZnO and ZnSO4.7H2O: 1.8, 1.9, 1.1 (V. fischeri); 8.8, 3.2, 6.1 (D. magna) and 0.24, 0.18, 0.98 (T. platyurus), respectively. The toxicity was due to solubilized Zn ions as proved with recombinant Zn-sensor bacteria. Differently from Zn compounds, Cu compounds had different toxicities: L(E)C50 (mg l(-1)) for bulk CuO, nano CuO and CuSO4: 3811, 79, 1.6 (V. fischeri), 165, 3.2, 0,17 (D. magna) and 95, 2.1, 0.11 (T. platyurus), respectively. Cu-sensor bacteria showed that toxicity to V. fischeri and T. platyurus was largely explained by soluble Cu ions. However, for Daphnia magna, nano and bulk CuO proved less bioavailable than for bacterial Cu-sensor. This is the first evaluation of ZnO, CuO and TiO2 toxicity to V. fischeri and T. platyurus. For nano ZnO and nano CuO this is also a first study for D. magna. "
"BACKGROUND: Combination of temozolomide (TMZ) with nonpegylated interferon alfa is associated with increased efficacy in terms of response rates compared with monotherapy. A multicenter phase II study was carried out to assess the activity and toxicity of TMZ plus pegylated interferon alfa-2b (peg-IFNalpha-2b), hypothesizing improved efficacy due to modified pharmacokinetic properties of the novel interferon (IFN) formulation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 124 patients with stage IV melanoma without prior chemotherapy and no cerebral metastases were treated with 100 mug peg-IFNalpha-2b s.c. per week and oral TMZ 200 mg/m(2) (days 1-5, every 28 days). Primary study end point was objective response, and secondary end points were overall and progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. RESULTS: In all, 116 patients were assessable for response: 2 (1.7%) had a complete response and 19 (16.4%) a partial response (overall response rate 18.1%). Of total, 25.0% achieved disease stabilization and 56.9% progressed. Overall survival was 9.4 months; PFS was 2.8 months. Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 20.7% and grade 3/4 leukopenia in 23.3%. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of TMZ plus peg-IFNalpha-2b in this large phase II study is moderate and comparable to published results of the combination of TMZ with non-peg-IFN. Likewise, the safety profile of peg-IFNalpha-2b seems to be similar to non-peg-IFN when combined with TMZ. "
"Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a clinical treatment that combines the effects of visible light irradiation with subsequent biochemical events that arise from the presence of a photosensitising drug (possessing no dark toxicity) to cause destruction of selected cells. Today, the most common agent used in dermatological PDT is 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). As a result of its hydrophilic character, ALA penetrates skin lesions poorly when applied topically. Its systemic bioavailability is limited and it is known to cause significant side effects when given orally or intravenously. Numerous chemical derivatives of ALA have been synthesised with the aims of either improving topical penetration or enhancing systemic bioavailability, while reducing side effects. In vitro cell culture experiments with ALA derivatives have yielded promising results. However, if ALA derivatives are to demonstrate meaningful clinical benefits, a rational approach to topical formulation design is required, along with a systematic study aimed at uncovering the true potential of ALA derivatives in photodynamic therapy. With respect to systemic ALA delivery, more study is required in the developing area of ALA-containing dendrons and dendrimers. "
"Abstract: Cyclosporine inhalation solution has the potential to improve outcomes following lung transplantation by delivering high concentrations of an immunosuppressant directly to the allograft while minimizing systemic drug exposure and associated toxicity. The objective of these studies was to evaluate the potential toxicity of aerosolized cyclosporine formulated in propylene glycol when given by inhalation route to rats and dogs for 28 days. Sprague-Dawley rats received total inhaled doses of 0 (air), 0 (vehicle, propylene glycol), 7.4, 24.3, and 53.9 mg cyclosporine/kg/day. In a separate study, beagle dogs were exposed to 0, 4.4, 7.7, and 9.7 mg cyclosporine/kg/day. Endpoints used to evaluate potential toxicity of inhaled cyclosporine were clinical observations, body weight, food consumption, respiratory functions, toxicokinetics, and clinical/anatomic pathology. Daily administration of aerosolized cyclosporine did not result in observable accumulation of cyclosporine in blood or lung tissue. Toxicokinetic analysis from the rat study showed that the exposure of cyclosporine was approximately 18 times higher in the lung tissue compared to the blood. Systemic effects were consistent with those known for cyclosporine. There was no unexpected systemic toxicity or clinically limiting local respiratory toxicity associated with inhalation exposure to cyclosporine inhalation solution at exposures up to 2.7 times the maximum human exposure in either rats or dogs. There were no respiratory or systemic effects of high doses of propylene glycol relative to air controls. These preclinical studies demonstrate the safety of aerosolized cyclosporine in propylene glycol and support its continued clinical investigation in patients undergoing allogeneic lung transplantation.

"BACKGROUND: Successful clinical application of dermal filler products requires an understanding of their physical characteristics and in vivo behavior. This study reviewed the data for hyaluronic acid dermal filler products derived from an animal source--the rooster comb. METHODS: A review of the hyaluronic acid literature was performed. Clinical experience with the animal-derived hyaluronic acid products was evaluated. RESULTS: The source of the hyaluronic acid has not been demonstrated to be a clinically important point of differentiation among filler products. Hypersensitivity reactions are rare and are also present in the products derived from bacteria. Variations that effect the hyaluronic acid products' physical characteristics and clinical performance are more closely related to cross-linking and formulation. Hyaluronic acid gel derived from animal sources is cross-linked by a sulfonyl-bis-ethyl bond and is a soft gel compared with other hyaluronic acid products. There is minimal gel swelling, which results in modest postinjection edema. Optimal clinical application favors patients who desire quick recovery and minimal palpability. CONCLUSIONS: Hyaluronic acid skin filler products derived from an animal source are safe and effective. Successful clinical application should be based on an understanding of the patient's goals and the choice of a hyaluronic acid product with the optimal characteristics. "
"Abstract: Soft-tissue augmentation and three-dimensional volume replacement remain a cornerstone of facial rejuvenation. There has been an exponential increase in interest in dermal fillers. Science and technology have kept pace with this demand, and currently there is a wide range of options from which to choose. This is especially well illustrated by the recent introduction of an entirely new class of agents--the hyaluronans. The temporary fillers (the collagens and the Zyderm and CosmoDerm families), however, remain an excellent alternative, as they have a well-documented safety record, there are multiple formulations that make them very versatile, and the admixture of local anesthetic decreases the discomfort of injection.

"Abstract: The systemic exposure of fluticasone propionate with hydrofluoroalkane propellant compared with chlorofluoro-carbon propellant and the effect of fluticasone propionate hydrofluoroalkane on 24-hour urinary cortisol in children aged 4 to 11 years with asthma were evaluated. Study 1 was an open-label, 2-way crossover study in which 16 subjects were randomized to 7.5 days each of fluticasone propionate hydrofluoroalkane 88 mug twice a day or fluticasone propionate chlorofluorocarbon 88 mug twice a day. In study 2, 63 subjects received 13.5 days of placebo followed by 27.5 days of fluticasone propionate hydrofluoroalkane 88 mug twice a day. The main outcome measure for study 1 was the difference between fluticasone propionate hydrofluoroalkane and fluticasone propionate chlorofluorocarbon in fluticasone propionate AUC(last) (area under the plasma fluticasone propionate concentration-time curve from zero up to the last quantifiable plasma concentration), and for study 2, 24-hour overnight urinary cortisol excretion. In study 1, fluticasone propionate systemic exposure was significantly lower (55%) with hydrofluoroalkane metered dose inhaler compared with chlorofluorocarbon metered dose inhaler. Study 2 showed no statistically significant changes in 24-hour overnight urinary cortisol excretion and no relationship to fluticasone propionate systemic exposure at this dose. The results of these 2 studies showed that in children aged 4 to 11 years with asthma, fluticasone propionate hydrofluoroalkane has lower systemic exposure compared with chlorofluorocarbon and no hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis effects as measured by 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion.

"Abstract: The chemical stability of tretinoin (RA) and isotretinoin (13RA) in ethanol and dermatological cream preparations exposed to solar simulated light (SSL), UVA, and visible light has been studied. Photostability was monitored by an HPLC method that allowed simultaneous analysis of RA and 13RA, thus allowing photodegradation due to isomerization to other retinoids and photolysis to non-retinoid products to be monitored. Both retinoids undergo both isomerization and photolysis following SSL, UVA and visible light exposure but RA is more sensitive to photodegradation than 13RA. Degradation of both retinoids by photolysis is considerably greater in cream formulations than in ethanol and the photodegradation follows second order kinetics. Rate constants and half-lives for degradation of RA and 13RA in ethanol solution and cream preparations subjected to different light sources are reported. The UVA component of SSL is the major contributor to photodegradation. Since UVA penetrates deeply into skin, our results suggest that photodegradation of RA may contribute to the photosensitivity associated with RA therapy. Our studies suggest that development of improved formulations and the use of effective UVA sunscreens may reduce the side effects of RA therapy. "
"Abstract: Tinea pedis is the most common dermatophytosis requiring topical antifungals for at least 1-4 weeks. To determine the effectiveness of a novel topical single dose formulation of terbinafine (film forming solution-FFS) in the treatment of tinea pedis, 344 outpatients from 43 dermatological centres in France and Bulgaria suffering from tinea pedis with possible extension to soles confirmed by mycological examination (direct and culture) were evaluated for efficacy of terbinafine 1%, 5%, 10% FFS in a randomised double blind vehicle controlled parallel group dose finding study. Evaluations were carried out at baseline, 1 and 6 weeks after a single application of FFS. Effective treatment rate based on negative mycology (direct and culture) and minimal signs and symptoms (two or less with only mild recorded) was measured at week 6. Effective treatment rates at week 6 with terbinafine 1%, 5% and 10% FFS were 66%, 70%, 61% compared with 18% with placebo. All three active preparations were shown to be significantly superior to placebo (P < 0.001). Terbinafine 1% and 5% FFS were shown to be non-inferior to terbinafine 10% FFS. Terbinafine 1% FFS is an effective, safe dose for the treatment of tinea pedis. This novel product represents a significant advance with the enhanced compliance and convenience that it offers. "
"Abstract: Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a dermatological fibrosing disease with potential systemic manifestations resulting in mild to severe symptoms including joint contractures. NSF can be lethal in a subset of cases. It has been recently observed that almost all patients with NSF have had severe renal insufficiency and have received prior administrations of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA). This review will focus on the specific evidence from a retrospective study performed at our center in combination with the general experience available. Conclusions summarize our current understanding of NSF. Recommendations are provided for use of GBCA in clinical MRI practice. Conclusions and recommendations include that the risk of inducing NSF is related to higher-dose administrations of GBCA and that there are differences in risk related to differences in gadolinium-chelate formulation, with the highest relative risk associated with gadodiamide (Omniscan, Nycomed Amersham, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.).

"Abstract: Rhodococcus equi causes serious pneumonia in neonatal foals and is an opportunistic pathogen of people with compromised cellular immunity. No effective vaccine against R. equi disease in foals is available. We tested the safety and immunogenicity of a live, fully attenuated riboflavin auxotrophic candidate vaccine strain of R. equi (R. equi rib-). We demonstrated that R. equi rib- is immunogenic and capable of inducing IFN-gamma responses in immunocompetent BALB/c mice, yet it is safe even in an immunocompromised SCID mouse infection model. Moreover, it protects immunocompetent mice against virulent R. equi challenge. In foals, R. equi rib- was likewise safe and stimulated serum R. equi-specific immune responses. A preliminary immunization strategy did not afford protection against virulent R. equi challenge and therefore, optimization of the vaccine formulation and or vaccination protocol will be necessary.

"BACKGROUND: Kinetin and niacinamide are used in the cosmetic industry as anti-aging agents. Neither the interactive/additive effects of these compounds nor the anti-aging efficacy on Asian skin has been studied. Objective To assess the clinical anti-aging effects and efficacy differences between kinetin plus niacinamide and niacinamide alone vs. vehicle placebo in an Asian cohort. METHODS: Fifty-two Taiwanese subjects were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, split-face comparative study. Group 1 subjects were treated with kinetin 0.03% plus niacinamide 4%, whereas group 2 subjects received niacinamide 4%. The treatment formulation was applied on one side of the face, whereas a placebo was applied on the other for a period of 12 weeks. We used noninvasive biometrological instruments to evaluate a variety of skin parameters at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, and 12. RESULTS: Persistent and significant reductions in spot, pore, wrinkle, and evenness counts were found at weeks 8 and 12 in group 1. A significant increase in corneal hydration status was also evident at week 12, whereas persistent decreases in erythema index were apparent at 8 and 12 weeks. In group 2, significant reductions in pore and evenness counts at week 8 and wrinkle counts at week 12 were noted. CONCLUSION: We found kinetin and niacinamide exert a synergistic anti-aging effect. Our data suggest that these compounds have multiactive, multifunctional, and pluripotent effects on skin. They are also both promising to be included in the cutaneous anti-aging cosmeceuticals in the future. "
"BACKGROUND: Cyclosporin A is widely used in Mexico as immunosuppressive therapy in organ transplantation and in the treatment of autoimmune disorders. Although several generic oral formulations of cyclosporin A are available in Mexico, information concerning the bioequivalence of these formulations in the Mexican population is not available in the published literature. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the bioequivalence and tolerability of a generic (test) and a branded (reference) soft-gelatin capsule formulation of cyclosporin A microemulsion 100 mg available in Mexico. METHODS: This randomized, open-label, 2-period cross-over study was performed at the Universidad Autónomade Nuevo León, Monterrey, México. Eligible subjects were healthy male volunteers who were randomly assigned to receive a single 100-mg dose of the test or reference formulation, followed by a 2-week washout period and administration of the alternate formulation. Doses were administered after a 12-hour overnight fast. For analysis of pharmacokinetic properties, including C(max), AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-infinity) , blood samples were obtained at intervals over the 48-hour period after dosing. The formulations were considered bioequivalent if the log-transformed ratios of Cma x and AUC were within the predetermined equivalence range (80%-125%). Tolerability was assessed by monitoring vital signs and laboratory tests (hematology, blood biochemistry, hepatic function, and urinalysis), and by questioning subjects about adverse events. RESULTS: Thirty-six male subjects (mean age, 22.08 years [range, 18-29 years]; mean weight, 78.23 kg [range, 72-89 kg]; mean height, 177 cm [range, 169-185 cm]) were enrolled in the study, and 34 (17 each randomized to receive the test or reference formulation first) completed it. No period or sequence effect was observed. The 90% CIs for the log-transformed ratios of C(max), AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-infinity) were 85.12 to 92.85, 92.14 to 99.75, and 92.19 to 99.72, respectively (all, P <0.05). Similar results were found for the data without log-transformation. No adverse events occurred or were reported by patients during the study. CONCLUSIONS: In this small study in healthy adult male Mexican volunteers, a single 100-mg dose of the test formulation was bioequivalent to a single 100-mg dose of the reference formulation based on the regulatory definition (rate and extent of absorption). Both formulations were well tolerated. "
"Abstract: Sulfur mustard (SM) is a powerful vesicant used as an agent of chemical warfare. The severity of lesions incurred after exposure to SM reiterated the need for an efficient and rapid neutralizing agent against SM. Previous studies have shown that postexposure treatment with iodine is effective against SM lesions in rodents. In the current study we used the pig model to emulate SM-induced burn lesions, and observed the immediate effect of a single dose of iodine formulation treatment on these burns. SSD, a common agent recommended for use in both chemical and thermal burns was used as control. Results indicated that 1.27 mg of SM caused deep lesions and histopathological changes in the pig skin as scored in the biopsies obtained. A single application of an iodine formulation 20 minutes from exposure to SM exhibited no protective action on the skin as evident in the biopsies obtained 1, 3, 5, 10, and 21 days after treatment. SSD treatment induced the least protective action. The SSD-treated wounds also took the longest to heal. Attempts to neutralize the SM action with iodine compounds were not successful in the pig model. Currently, other compounds are being investigated. Attention must be drawn to the adverse effect of SSD on SM-induced wounds. Further studies must be initiated to elucidate this phenomenon. "
"BACKGROUND: Sunscreens may allow overexposure to ultraviolet A (UVA) in fair-skinned persons and prevent symptoms of sunburn, but their benefits for the prevention of melanoma are uncertain. METHODS: A PubMed search was performed that identified all known studies of the association of sunscreen use with melanoma risk during 1966-2007. A total of 18 studies were identified, of which 17 met criteria for inclusion in the analysis. Of these, 10 were conducted at latitudes >40 degrees from the equator and 7 at <or=40 degrees . Data were pooled for all latitudes combined and also according to these latitude strata. The association of skin pigmentation and latitude with odds ratios was estimated using linear regression. RESULTS: Overall, there was no statistically significant effect of use of sunscreens on risk of melanoma (odds ratio 1.2, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.9-1.6; p for heterogeneity < 0.0001). However, there was an interaction with latitude. At >40 degrees from the equator, the odds ratio was 1.6 (95% C.I. 1.3-1.9; p for heterogeneity = 0.006), whereas it was 0.7 at <or=40 degrees (95% C.I. 0.4-1.0; p for heterogeneity = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: Use of common sunscreen formulations that absorb UVB almost completely, but transmit large quantities of UVA, may contribute to risk of melanoma in populations at latitudes >40 degrees. "
"BACKGROUND: Androgenetic alopecia (pattern baldness) affects approximately half of all white-skinned men and women over the age of 40 years. Based on preclinical studies in mice in which topical fulvestrant (ICI182,780, an anti-oestrogen) caused telogen hair follicles to enter anagen, thereby causing hair growth, a topical formulation of fulvestrant was developed for the potential treatment of androgenetic alopecia. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of fulvestrant solution in stimulating hair growth in men and postmenopausal women with androgenetic alopecia in two randomized, phase II, minoxidil- and/or vehicle-controlled studies. METHODS: One hundred and two white-skinned men aged 18-50 years with Norwood/Hamilton grades III, IIIv, IV, V or Va androgenetic alopecia received topical fulvestrant 70 mg mL(-1) solution, vehicle or minoxidil 2% solution twice daily for 16 weeks. Seventy postmenopausal women with Ludwig grade 1 or 2 androgenetic alopecia received topical fulvestrant 70 mg mL(-1) solution or vehicle twice daily for 16 weeks. The endpoints in both studies were hair density, cumulative hair thickness and hair growth rate, measured by TrichoScan analysis of digital images. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences favouring fulvestrant over vehicle at study end (day 113) for any of the efficacy parameters in men or women. Statistically significant differences in favour of minoxidil over fulvestrant were seen from day 57 onwards for hair density, cumulative hair thickness and hair growth rate in men. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate a lack of effect of topical fulvestrant in the treatment of subjects with androgenetic alopecia. The reasons for this lack of effect remain unclear. "
"BACKGROUND: A meta-analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing chlorhexidine gluconate with povidone-iodine solutions for venous catheter site care found that the use of chlorhexidine gluconate significantly reduced the risk for catheter-related bloodstream infections and that it was cost-effective. The objective of the study was to implement locally formulated chlorhexidine gluconate for central venous catheter (CVC) site care in intensive care units (ICUs) at Siriraj Hospital. METHODS: The study was conducted in 312 subjects who needed CVC insertions in 3 ICUs from January to July 2006. One hundred twenty subjects received 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% alcohol, whereas 192 subjects received 10% povidone-iodine as the antiseptic solution for CVC site care. The patients were assessed for CVC-related infections and for any adverse effects of 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% alcohol. RESULTS: The incidence of CRBSIs in the indwelling CVC subjects who received 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% alcohol was less than those who received 10% povidone-iodine during the same period, 3.2 versus 5.6 episodes per 1000 CVC days, respectively (P= .06; OR, 3.26; 95% CI: 0.97-10.92). No adverse effects related to using 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% alcohol were observed. CONCLUSION: The locally formulated 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% alcohol was safe, effective, and efficient for CVC site care in ICUs at Siriraj Hospital. "
"Abstract: Ciclosporin and tacrolimus are calcineurin inhibiting immunosuppressant agents useful in the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory dermatoses. Available data and clinical experience demonstrate ciclosporin's efficacy in treating psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, lichen planus, autoimmune bullous disease (in combination with corticosteroids), recalcitrant chronic idiopathic urticaria, and chronic dermatitis of the hands and feet. Although the role of topical tacrolimus in atopic dermatitis is well established, such experience with the oral formulation of tacrolimus has been limited. However, there are several case studies and anecdotal reports of the successful use of oral tacrolimus in various dermatoses. In this article we discuss the utility of systemic ciclosporin and tacrolimus in dermatology. "
"Abstract: Pityriacitrin (PIT), produced by Malassezia yeasts, is an UV absorbing substance that might cause hypopigmentation in pityriasis versicolor alba. We aimed to investigate the UV protective effect of PIT in humans using in vitro and in vivo test methods. Spectrophotometry of PIT cream and the vehicle was performed in the wavelength range from 290 to 400 nm. UV transmission and the sun protection factor (SPF) were assessed for different cream formulations. Using colorimetry we evaluated erythema and pigmentation following irradiation of cream-protected and non-protected skin of healthy subjects. UVB as well as UVA transmission decreased with increasing PIT concentrations. An increase of PIT concentration of 1.25, 2.5, and 5% was associated with slightly increasing SPFs of 1.4, 1.5, and 1.7, respectively. Our in vivo tests confirmed the validity of the SPF of PIT 5% cream determined in vitro. In conclusion, the UV protective effect of PIT is all in all very weak suggesting that PIT is likely only an inferior cofactor in the development of hypopigmentation in pityriasis versicolor alba lesions following sun exposure. "
"Abstract: The application of photosensitisers (PSs) in photodynamic therapy (PDT) is often hampered by their hydrophobicity, as this complicates their formulation and results in an unfavourable biodistribution. Consequently, there is an urgent need for novel delivery vehicles for PSs. In this paper, the loading and stability of thermosensitive mPEG-b-p(HPMAm-Lac2) micelles with a hydrophobic solketal-substituted phthalocyanine (Si(sol)2Pc) photosensitiser were studied. It was shown that the Si(sol)2Pc could be loaded efficiently in the micelles (diameter 75 nm) up to a concentration of approximately 2 mg/mL. UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy showed that at low concentrations (< or =0.05 microM, 0.45 mg/mL polymer), the PS was molecularly dissolved in the micellar core, whereas it was present in an aggregated form at higher concentrations. In B16F10 and 14C cells, the photocytotoxicity of Si(sol)2Pc-loaded micelles (PS<0.05 microM) was similar to free PS, i.e. IC(50) of 3.0+/-0.2 nM (10% serum). The cellular uptake of high-loaded micelles (10 microM Si(sol)2Pc) was low and independent of the serum concentration. The nanoaggregates of Si(sol)2Pc loaded in the micellar core were only released upon hydrolysis-induced micellar dissociation, which was observed after 5.5 h at pH 8.7 at 37 degrees C. The stability of the high-loaded micellar Si(sol)2Pc formulation also in the presence of serum, the controlled release of the PS upon micellar disintegration and the high photodynamic activity of Si(sol)2Pc make these micelles interesting for future in vivo studies.

"Abstract: Emollients play an important part in the management of patients with dry skin disorders, such as atopy, allergy, eczema, psoriasis or dryness following chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Their use in the treatment of diseased and sensitive skin requires not only an efficient hydrating and lipid-replenishing effect on the skin, but minimal risk for skin irritation or sensitization. This will be influenced by their formulation and number and type of ingredients and, due to the nature of their application, requires clinical testing to ensure their appropriateness for dermatological rather than cosmetic use. A new generation of emollients has been developed for the care of dry, or very dry, and sensitive skin. Among these, Dardia Lipo Line (Intendis GmbH, Berlin, Germany) has been formulated specifically for use in post-therapy preventive skin care. The current clinical evidence for this line of emollients is reviewed here. "
"BACKGROUND: In 2001, a transdermal matrix patch formulation of buprenorphine was approved for the treatment of moderate to severe cancer pain and severe pain that is unresponsive to nonopioid analgesics. The primary recommendation contained in the prescribing information was that transdermal patches be worn for a 3-day period before application of a new patch. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate the potential for extending the time the buprenorphine patch is worn from 3 to 4 days. METHODS: This single-center, randomized, open-label, crossover Phase III study compared the efficacy and tolerability of the buprenorphine transdermal patch applied for different durations, with patch changes every 3 days versus every 4 days (12 days each), in patients with chronic moderate or severe pain of malignant or nonmalignant origin. Study participants were aged >18 years, had already responded to at least 4 weeks of transdermal buprenorphine, and had achieved steady-state conditions for at least 2 weeks before enrollment. The primary end point was patients' rating of the quality of treatment (analgesic efficacy and tolerability, rated on a 5-point scale: very good, good, satisfactory, poor, and inadequate) at the completion of each treatment regimen. Also recorded were physicians' ratings of the quality of treatment; pain intensity, rated on an 11-point numerical rating scale (from 0 = no pain to 10 = worst pain imaginable) and on the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) (maximum pain = 3.0); health status, assessed using the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), expressed as a percentage of the best health condition (100%); and pain relief (5-point scale: complete, good, satisfactory, slight, and none). Local skin tolerability was evaluated for objective and subjective dermatologic symptoms at the patch application sites. Patients recorded daily pain intensities at specified times of day and night, pain relief (5-point verbal rating scale), and sleep duration (<or=2 hours, >2-3 hours, >3-<6 hours, or >or=6 hours) in a diary. The safety profile was evaluated based on standard monitoring of adverse events, vital signs, and routine laboratory tests. RESULTS: Forty-nine white patients (25 women, 24 men) were enrolled; their mean (SD) age was 61.6 (11.5) years, and their mean weight was 74.7 (16.7) kg. The most common source of pain was musculoskeletal disorders (40 patients), followed by nervous system disorders (10), neoplasms (9), injuries (5), and other causes (6). Forty-one patients completed the study; 2 patients discontinued because of adverse events, 1 because of lack of efficacy, and 5 for nonmedical reasons. Thirty-three patients provided data per protocol. Patients in the perprotocol population received a mean (SD) transdermal buprenorphine dose of 49.9 (38.9) microg/h. The proportion of patients in the per-protocol population rating the quality of treatment as adequate (combined ratings of very good, good, and satisfactory) was 93.9% (31/33) for both regimens. The physicians' ratings indicated adequate quality of treatment in 93.8% (30/32) of patients applying 4 patches for 3 days each and 97.0% (32/33) of patients applying 3 patches for 4 days each. Mean (SD) pain intensity scores on the numerical rating scale were similar after completion of the 3- and 4-day regimens (3.73 [1.88] and 3.88 [1.75] points, respectively), as were MPQ scores (0.79 [0.67] and 0.79 [0.78]). The mean (SD) proportion of days with at least satisfactory pain relief was 83.9% (26.1%) and 85.6% (24.4%) for the 3- and 4-day regimens; the corresponding proportions of nights with at least satisfactory pain relief were 85.2% (26.6%) and 88.1% (21.4%). Continuously assessed pain intensities at specified times of day and night (numerical rating scale) did not differ significantly between regimens. Mean SF-36 health status scores did not differ significantly between regimens (total score: 37.7% [17.0%] and 37.7% [17.3%]). Mean rates of nights with good sleep quality were 28.5% (39.9%) for the 3-day regimen and 36.0% (42.6%) for the 4-day regimen. Local skin tolerability was comparable for the 3- and 4-day regimens, with objective findings (mainly erythema) at the patch-application sites in 17 of 32 and 11 of 33 patients, respectively, and subjective symptoms (mainly itching) in 16 of 32 and 13 of 33 patients. The most common adverse events in the safety population were nausea, dizziness/giddiness, and malaise/fatigue (3/49 [6.1%] each). CONCLUSION: Analgesic efficacy, patients' satisfaction with the quality of treatment, and skin tolerability did not differ significantly between 3 and 4 days of patch application in these patients with chronic pain who had been previously stabilized on transdermal buprenorphine.

"PURPOSE: This work was intended to develop and evaluate a new polymeric system based on amphiphilic carboxymethylpullulans (CMP(49)C(8) and CMP(12)C(8)) that can spontaneously self-assemble in aqueous solutions and efficiently solubilize hydrophobic drugs. METHODS: The self-assembling properties of CMP(49)C(8) and CMP(12)C(8) were characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy and surface tension measurements. The solubilization of benzophenone and docetaxel was assessed from surface tension measurements, UV spectrometry and HPLC assays. The in vitro cytoxicity of CMP(49)C(8) solutions and the docetaxel commercial vehicle (Tween 80/Ethanol-water) were evaluated in the absence and in the presence of docetaxel. RESULTS: Compared to CMP(12)C(8), CMP(49)C(8) in aqueous solutions appeared to self-organize into monomolecular aggregates containing hydrophobic nanodomains, and to significantly increase the apparent solubility of benzophenone. Docetaxel solubility could also be improved in the presence of CMP(49)C(8) but to a lower extent due to the surface properties of the drug. Nevertheless, in vitro, the cytotoxicity studies revealed that against cancer cells, the CMP(49)C(8)-docetaxel formulation was equipotent to the commercial docetaxel one. Furthermore, in the absence of the drug, CMP(49)C(8) appeared less cytotoxic against macrophages than the Tween 80/Ethanol-water. CONCLUSIONS: CMP(49)C(8) is a good candidate for solubilizing hydrophobic drugs and could be applied to docetaxel formulations. "
"Abstract: Facial and flexural psoriasis may impair the quality of life of psoriatic patients considerably. For the adequate management of psoriasis it is important to pay attention to lesions at these sensitive sites, which require an approach different to that for lesions on other sites in several respects. An extensive literature search was carried out to collect evidence-based data on facial and flexural psoriasis with respect to epidemiology, clinical aspects, pathogenetic factors and various treatments. Subsequently, a panel of experts, the Copenhagen Psoriasis Working Group (CPWG), discussed these aspects and several recommendations were formulated reconciling the evidence-based data. Facial psoriasis occurs in 17-46% of psoriatics and flexural psoriasis is experienced by 6.8-36% of patients with psoriasis. Therefore, psoriasis at these sites cannot be regarded as a rare manifestation. Facial psoriasis is a prognostic marker indicating a poor prognosis of psoriasis. Facial and flexural psoriasis cannot be regarded as distinct disease entities but rather as site variations. The clinical features of facial psoriasis suggest that there are three subtypes: hairline psoriasis, sebo-psoriasis and true facial psoriasis. Otitis externa and ocular manifestations should not be neglected. Evidence that microbiological factors may be relevant to facial and flexural psoriasis is virtually absent. For facial psoriasis the response to UV radiation is variable. At least 5% of psoriatics have photosensitive psoriasis. In these patients photosensitive diseases such as lupus erythematodes and polymorphic light eruption have to be excluded. Based on the literature assessment and working group discussions the CPWG concluded the following. (1) Low-potency topical corticosteroids, vitamin D3 analogues and calcineurin inhibitors are first choice treatments in facial and flexural psoriasis. Evidence for the efficacy of the first two modalities is at level 3 while it is at level 1 for the third one. An individualized approach is indicated; for example, in case of corticosteroid side effects in the past the other two modalities should be selected and in unstable psoriasis prone to irritation, monotherapy with vitamin D3 analogues should be avoided. (2) Antimicrobial treatments are not indicated for facial and flexural psoriasis. (3) Dithranol and tar treatment are not indicated as first-line treatment but only if the first-line options fail. (4) In case topical therapies are not effective, phototherapy and systemic treatments are indicated. (5) For future drug development the combination of vitamin D3 analogues with low strength corticosteroids is recommended. "
"Abstract: The enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) is a new formulation of mycophenolic acid with a gastro-resistant enteric coating, which releases the drug in the intestine, reducing the incidence of the gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects. The present work provided a summary of 20 patients with liver transplantation and more than a 1 year of treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) who, after presentation of GI complications, were converted to EC-MPS. The patients were followed over a 3-month period after beginning EC-MPS treatment. The mean age of the cohort was 53 +/- 10 years and included 75% men. The reasons for transplantation were ethanol cirrhosis (70%), hepatitis C cirrhosis (30%), hepatocarcinoma (5%), and Wilson's disease (5%). At baseline, all patients were being treated with cyclosporine (CsA). CsA doses and levels were reduced during follow-up: baseline dose 179 mg/day versus 143 mg/day at 3 months; levels: 90.4 ng/mL versus 85.8 ng/mL, respectively (P = .017). The administered dose of EC-MPS was 720 mg/day in all cases. The GI complications at baseline were: diarrhea 60% (92% moderate-severe), abdominal discomfort 60% (58% moderate), abdominal pain 45% (44% moderate-severe), gas 40% (38% moderate-severe), nausea 20% (25% moderate), and dyspepsia 20% (mild). After 3 months of EC-MPS treatment, only two patients (10%) displayed moderate diarrhea. The renal evolution was favorable, serum creatinine was reduced, and 24-hour creatinine clearance significantly increased (creatinine: 1.78 +/- 1.6 mg/dL at baseline versus 1.30 +/- 0.3 mg/dL at 3 months, P = .002; creatinine clearance: 72.8 +/- 18 mL/min versus 79.6 +/- 13 mL/min, P = .001). Conversion of MMF to EC-MPS in liver transplant recipients solved the GI tolerability problems and improved renal function during the first 3 months, probably due to the concomitant reduction of anticalcineurinic dose.

"Abstract: Fluorescence diagnosis following oral administration of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) has shown to enable the sensitive visualization of intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and early carcinoma in Barrett's esophagus. Once being established, this technique will be a potential alternative to today's standard diagnosis, i.e. four-quadrant random biopsies which are taken every 1-2 cm of the esophagus for histopathological analysis. In order to further improve this methodology, topical application of lipophilic 5-ALA esters to the esophagus could be advantageous in terms of fluorescence contrast and fluorescence intensity in the target tissue, adverse side effects, as well as application time. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a bioadhesive formulation loaded with hexylaminolevulinate (HAL) targeting the esophageal lining. In the present study, different mucoadhesive gels including poloxamer 407, cross-linked polyacrylic acid, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and chitosan have been evaluated with respect to bioadhesion to the esophagus using an ex vivo rat model and a clinical study on healthy volunteers. In order to visualize the mucoadhesive properties of the formulations, a blue dye was incorporated as contrast agent. Chitosan has shown the best esophageal adhesion both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, using the in vitro release profiles from chitosan loaded with 40 mM of HAL, one can estimate that after a residence time of 10 min on the esophageal wall, the amount of HAL delivered to the epithelium will be sufficient to perform fluorescence diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus following swallowing of this formulation.

"BACKGROUND: Immunosuppressive drugs are used as steroid-sparing agents in the management of blistering autoimmune diseases. Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a relatively new adjuvant drug that selectively inhibits T and B lymphocyte proliferation by suppressing de novo purine synthesis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of MPA in refractory blistering autoimmune diseases and the safety profile of a recent formulation, enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS), in comparison with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients with various bullous dermatoses (three pemphigus vulgaris, one pemphigus herpetiformis, three bullous pemphigoid (BP), two cicatricial pemphigoid (CP) and three epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA)) were enrolled in the study. In 10 cases, MPA was administered in combination with systemic corticosteroids, while in two patients with severe diabetes mellitus MPA was employed as monotherapy. The total time on MPA varied from 2 to 8 months. Four patients were given MMF (2,000 mg daily), seven received EC-MPS (1,440 mg daily) and one received both sequentially. RESULTS: Complete remission, lasting for a mean time of 6.1 months, was achieved in 10 patients. Partial remission was obtained in two patients with disseminated CP and EBA. Both MMF and EC-MPS were well tolerated, but the latter was better in terms of gastrointestinal adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: MPA may be proposed as a first-line adjuvant agent for pemphigus as well as for refractory BP and CP. MPA monotherapy has to be considered in selected cases of BP and pemphigus. The highly promising results obtained in EBA suggest a future key role for MPA in the management of this disease. "
"Abstract: 5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-mediated photodynamic therapy has been proposed as an alternative, cervix-sparing treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). In this context, topical application of 5-ALA to the cervix is beneficial due to the small necessary dose and its minimal side effects. Therefore, lipophilic 5-ALA esters, such as hexylaminolevulinate (HAL), have led to improved local bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. Hydrogels have shown to be more appropriate for the local delivery of these derivatives, but due to the limited long-term stability of such formulations at 25 degrees C, the development of an extemporaneously prepared hydrogel targeting CIN can be advantageous. Therefore, a poloxamer 407 thermosetting gel, which is liquid at room temperature and becomes a semi-solid when in contact with the female genital tract, has been evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Rheological evaluation has shown that a 17.0% poloxamer 407 hydrogel with a sol-gel transition at 24.8 +/- 0.6 degrees C was the best formulation for easy application and optimal residence time. Furthermore, similarly to other hydrogels previously tested, such a formulation shows a more complete HAL release in vitro than conventional cream vehicles, and tends to increase porphyrin accumulation in nude mice skin. Finally, in vitro release profiles were correlated to the in vivo results. "
"Abstract: The aim of this study was to test the ability of poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly (epsilon-caprolactone) (PEO-b-PCL) micelles to reduce the renal uptake and nephrotoxicity of Cyclosporine A (CyA) after multiple dose administration. Sprague-Dawley rats received CyA i.v. at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day delivered as the commercial formulation (Sandimmune) or polymeric micellar formulation (PM-CyA). Cremophor EL (the solubilizing agent in Sandimmune), unloaded PEO-b-PCL micelles, or normal saline were also administered i.v. to control rats. After 7 days, kidney function was assessed through measurement of creatinine (CLcr) and urea clearances, as well as electrolyte concentrations in plasma. Blood and kidney were collected and assayed for CyA. Sandimmune administration led to decreased CLcr, and increased urea and potassium levels in plasma. In contrast, functional nephrotoxicity with the PM-CyA was not apparent, as the CLcr did not change significantly. The rate of increase in body weight in control rats was 3.1-3.4% per day. Weight gains (1.8% per day) were also noted in the rats given PM-CyA, although the body weight of animals receiving Sandimmune remained constant. Compared to Sandimmune, polymeric micelles reduced kidney uptake of CyA by 2.6-fold, and increased CyA levels in blood by 2.1-fold. The results show a potential for PEO-b-PCL micelles in restricting the nephrotoxicity of CyA. "
"UNLABELLED: Acidic solutions have been used for decades to treat a variety of skin conditions. Many of these solutions consist of organic acids with a hydroxy group on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl carbon and are referred to as alpha-hydroxy acids (AHA). Organic acids with hydroxy groups on the second carbon from the carbonyl carbon are referred to as beta-hydroxy acids (BHA). Both AHA and BHA are used to treat various skin conditions. One of the most widely used AHA is glycolic acid, while salicylic acid is a commonly used BHA. Chemical peels containing 20% to 70% glycolic acid have been used by dermatologists to treat ichthyosis, acne, xerosis, actinic keratosis, seborrheic keratoses, warts, and psoriasis. AHA have recently been used to treat photoaged skin and are now included in many commercially available cosmetic skin treatments. When used in a formulation for a chemical peel, topical treatment of skin with AHA and BHA can result in removal of the stratum corneum, alteration of the skin's histology, and increased cell proliferation in the basal layer of the epidermis. Since AHA and BHA are used to correct photoaged skin, and since exposure to sunlight of skin treated with AHA or BHA is likely, studies were designed to determine the effects of topical application of creams containing AHA (0%, 4%, or 10% glycolic acid, pH 3.5) or BHA (0%, 2%, or 4% salicylic acid, pH 4.0) on the photocarcinogenesis of simulated solar radiation using a filtered 6.5 kW xenon arc light source [simulated solar light (SSL)]. Male and female Crl:SKH-1 (hr-/hr-) hairless mice were exposed to glycolic acid or salicylic acid alone or in combination with SSL for 40 weeks, and the mice were followed for an additional 12 weeks. 1-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 36 male and 36 female mice were exposed to 0.0, 0.3, 0.6, or 0.9 minimal erythema dose (MED) of SSL during the afternoon (1200 to 1600 hours) 5 days per week for 40 weeks. Groups of 18 male and 18 female mice were treated in the morning (0800 to 1100 hours) with 2 mg/cm2 control cream, 4% glycolic acid cream, 10% glycolic acid cream, 2% salicylic acid cream, or 4% salicylic acid cream on the dorsal skin, and in the afternoon (1200 to 1600 hours) with 0.3 MED of SSL 5 days per week for 40 weeks. Additional groups of 18 male and 18 female mice were treated in the morning (0800 to 1100 hours) with 2 mg/cm2 control cream, 4% glycolic acid cream, 10% glycolic acid cream, 2% salicylic acid cream, or 4% salicylic acid cream on the dorsal skin, and in the afternoon (1200 to 1600 hours) with 0.6 MED of SSL 5 days per week for 40 weeks. All mice were held an additional 12 weeks following the end of treatment. There were no effects of SSL exposure or topical treatment on the body weights of the mice. Increasing doses of SSL resulted in an SSL-dose trend in survival, with the greatest dose of SSL causing the earliest removal. This effect was present in both the untreated and control cream treated mice. The only consistent effect of glycolic acid on survival was a dose-dependent increase in survival of females at 0.3 MED SSL. Survival was increased in mice exposed to 0.6 MED of SSL and treated with 2% and 4% salicylic acid compared to mice treated with 0.6 MED and treated only with the vehicle. This effect was not observed in the mice treated with 0.0 and 0.3 MED of SSL and salicylic acid compared to the control groups. The mean or median time to first skin tumor of at least 1 mm decreased with increasing SSL exposure concentration in mice that were not treated with cream. Addition of the control cream resulted in a decrease in the time to tumor at 0.3 and 0.6 MED of SSL in male and female mice. The addition of glycolic acid (4% or 10%) did not affect the time to tumor in male or female mice at either SSL dose when compared to mice receiving the control cream. When compared to mice receiving control cream, the inclusion of 4% salicylic acid in the cream increased the time to tumor for male mice receiving 0.3 or 0.6 MED of SSL and female mice receiving 0.3 MED of SSL. The results indicate that inclusion of glycolic acid in the topical cream had no effect on the time required to induce tumors by SSL; however, inclusion of salicylic acid at 4% in the cream was photoprotective, increasing the time required to achieve median tumor incidence at a corresponding dose of SSL and control cream. The skin tumors induced by SSL in mice were squamous cell papilloma, carcinoma in situ, and squamous cell carcinoma. Except for papilloma in male mice, the tumors were induced in a dose-dependent manner by SSL in male and female mice. In male and female mice treated with control cream, the exposure to SSL caused significant increases in the incidences of carcinoma in situ, squamous cell carcinoma, and the combined incidence of carcinoma in situ and squamous cell carcinoma. When male or female mice were exposed to 0.3 or 0.6 MED SSL, the inclusion of 4% or 10% glycolic acid did not affect the induction of skin neoplasms over the incidence detected when the control cream was used, with the single exception of a glycolic acid dose-trend in squamous cell carcinoma incidence in male mice receiving 0.3 MED SSL. The inclusion of salicylic acid in the cream that was topically applied to female mice did not affect squamous cell papilloma formation at either SSL dose. The incidence of carcinoma in situ was decreased in male and female mice at 0.3 MED SSL when treated with 4% salicylic acid. A salicylic acid dose-trend was also observed in both sexes at 0.3 MED SSL. CONCLUSIONS: These experiments investigated the impact of topical application of a cosmetic formulation containing 4% or 10% glycolic acid (pH 3.5) or 2% or 4% salicylic acid (pH 4) on the photocarcinogenesis of filtered 6.5 kW xenon arc simulated solar light (SSL) in SKH-1 hairless mice. Taking into consideration the survival data, time to tumor data, and the pathology results, glycolic acid did not alter the photocarcinogenesis of SSL, and salicylic acid was photoprotective, reducing the carcinogenicity of 0.3 MED SSL.

"Abstract: Deficiency in nutritional determinants of homocysteine (HCY) metabolism, such as vitamin B(12) and folate, during pregnancy is known to influence HCY levels in the progeny, which in turn may exert adverse effects during development, including liver defects. Since short hypoxia has been shown to induce tolerance to subsequent stress in various cells including hepatocytes, and as vitamins B deficiency and hypoxic episodes may simultaneously occur in neonates, we aimed to investigate the influence of brief postnatal hypoxia (100% N(2) for 5 min) on the liver of rat pups born from dams fed a deficient regimen, i.e., depleted in vitamins B(12), B(2), folate, and choline. Four experimental groups were studied: control, hypoxia, deficiency, and hypoxia + deficiency. Although hypoxia transiently stimulated HCY catabolic pathways, it was associated with a progressive increase of hyperhomocysteinemia in deficient pups, with a fall of cystathionine beta-synthase activity at 21 days. At this stage, inducible NO synthase activity was dramatically increased and glutathione reductase decreased, specifically in the group combining hypoxia and deficiency. Also, hypoxia enhanced the deficiency-induced drop of the S-adenosylmethionine/S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio. In parallel, early exposure to the methyl-deficient regimen induced oxidative stress and led to hepatic steatosis, which was found to be more severe in pups additionally exposed to hypoxia. In conclusion, brief neonatal hypoxia may accentuate the long-term adverse effects of impaired HCY metabolism in the liver resulting from an inadequate nutritional regimen during pregnancy, and our data emphasize the importance of early factors on adult disease.

"Abstract: Targeted drug delivery has the potential to improve the efficacy of a therapeutic agent while reducing its side effects. The folate receptor type beta (FR-beta) is a cell surface marker selectively expressed in the leukemic cells of approximately 70% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Upregulation of FR-beta may also be selectively induced in AML cells by treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). In this study, the role of formulation composition in FR-targeted liposomal doxorubicin (DOX) delivery to AML cells was investigated. Liposomal formulations with a variable percentage of folate-polyethylene glycol distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (f-PEG-DSPE) were synthesized and evaluated for FR-beta-targeted DOX delivery in MV4-11 AML cells in vitro and for their pharmacokinetic properties in vivo. The formulation containing 0.5 mol % f-PEG-DSPE exhibited the highest efficiency of cellular uptake and in vitro cytotoxicity, as well as a long systemic circulation time in mice. In MV4-11 cells, the binding and cytotoxicity of FR-targeted liposomal DOX based on this formulation was also enhanced by ATRA-induced FR-beta upregulation. "
"BACKGROUND: Squamous cell carcinomas are common skin tumors in cats. We investigated photodynamic therapy (PDT) using a new liposomal photosensitizer as a minimally invasive, effective treatment that can be easily performed while achieving good cosmetic results. AIM: The goal of this study was to assess and describe possible toxicities using a liposomal formulation of the photosensitizer meta-(Tetrahydroxyphenyl)Chlorin (m-THPC) and investigate if favorable pharmacokinetics translate into favorable tumor response and control. ANIMALS: Eighteen client-owned cats with 20 spontaneous cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas were included in the study. METHODS: PDT was performed using a new, liposomal formulation of the photosensitizer. Toxicity, tumor response, and tumor control were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: No general adverse effects were observed in cats treated with the new liposomal formulation. Mild local toxicity such as erythema and edema were seen in 15% of the patients. All cats responded to therapy, with a complete response rate of 100%. The overall 1-year control rate was 75%. The tumor recurrence rate was 20% with a median time to recurrence of 172.25 +/-87.1) days. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: A new liposomal photosensitizer was successfully used for squamous cell carcinoma in cats and was well tolerated. There were no systemic adverse effects observed with the liposomal formulation. The favorable pharmacokinetics of the liposomal drug resulted in a favorable tumor response. "
"BACKGROUND: Ebastine is a long-acting, second-generation, selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist. A fast-dissolving tablet formulation of ebastine has been developed at 10- and 20-mg doses, with the intention of facilitating administration to patients experiencing problems with swallowing, including those confined to bed and elderly people, as well as those who may need to use ebastine when they do not have easy access to water to aid swallowing a tablet. OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to assess the pharmacodynamic effects (ie, inhibition of wheal response to cutaneous histamine challenge, and subjective assessments of itching, flare, and pain) and tolerability of the fast-dissolving 20-mg ebastine tablet formulation compared with desloratadine 5-mg capsule and placebo. Acceptability and convenience of the fast-dissolving tablet were also evaluated. METHODS: This double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, placebo-controlled, 3-period crossover study was conducted at the Drug Research Centre, Department of Clinical Pharmacology, the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain. Healthy, nonatopic, white adults aged 18 to 40 years were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 study sequences: ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CBA, or CAB, where A was the ebastine fast-dissolving 20-mg tablet, B was the desloratadine 5-mg capsule, and C was placebo. All study drugs were given orally once daily (8-9 AM) on days 1 to 5 of each study period. Study periods were separated by a washout period of 7 to 10 days. Histamine skin-prick test (SPT) challenge was performed before study drug administration on day 1 of each period (baseline), and then every 20 minutes for 2 hours after administration and again after 24 hours. The final SPT was 24 hours after the day-5 dose was administered. The primary end point was inhibition o f the histamine response, defined as the percentage reduction from baseline wheal area 24 hours after 5 days of administration. Subjective symptoms (itching, flare, and pain) were assessed by subjects using visual analog scales every 20 minutes for 2 hours after administration on day 1. At study end, acceptability (taste, convenience, and overall preference) of the fast-dissolving tablet and capsule formulations were assessed using a questionnaire completed by subjects. Tolerability was assessed using physical examination, laboratory analysis, physician questioning, and spontaneous reporting. RESULTS: Thirty-six people were randomized (22 women, 14 men; mean [SD] age, 24.7 [4.1] years; mean [SD] weight, 63.2 [9.9] kg); 35 completed the study (1 subject was lost to follow-up after the second study period). Unadjusted mean (SD) wheal areas 24 hours after dose administration on day 5 were 72.9 (29.5), 115.0 (32.1), and 146.7 (32.2) mm(2), for ebastine, desloratadine, and placebo, respectively. Mean differences in reduction from baseline in wheal area were 29.0% for ebastine versus desloratadine and 43.7% for ebastine versus placebo (both, P < 0.001). Corresponding unadjusted mean (SD) wheal areas 24 hours after administration of the first dose on day 1 were 76.5 (22.5), 128.9 (24.0), and 140.5 (33.1) mm(2). Mean itching, flare, and pain ratings were not significantly different between study drugs. Results from the preference questionnaire indicated that the majority (80%) preferred the ebastine fast-dissolving tablet to the desloratadine capsule (and hypothetically also to tablets and oral solution, which were not tested in this study). Ninety-seven percent of subjects were of the opinion that compliance in the home setting would be facilitated by the fas-tdissolving tablet formulation. Fourteen adverse events (AEs) were reported in 9 (25%) volunteers; all AEs were of mild or moderate intensity. Five occurred with ebastine 20 mg (intermittent somnolence, back pain, pharyngolaryngeal pain, pyrexia, and oral pain [1 patient each]), 5 occurred with desloratadine 5 mg (asthenia [2 patients] and dry mouth, somnolence, and back pain [1 patient each]), and 4 occurred with placebo (diarrhea [2 patients] and somnolence and headache [1 patient each]). The relationship with the study drugs was considered unlikely in 6 cases and possible in the remaining 8 cases. An additional AE (back pain) occurred during a washout period. CONCLUSIONS: In this small study in healthy, nonatopic white subjects, inhibition of the response to histamine injection was significantly greater with the ebastine 20-mg fast-dissolving tablet compared with desloratadine 5-mg capsule and placebo after 1 and 5 days of administration. Most participants expressed an overall preference for the fast-dissolving tablet formulation over capsules. All study drugs were well tolerated. "
"BACKGROUND: Topical retinoids are considered first-line therapy in the treatment of acne vulgaris, yet can be associated with cutaneous irritation, including erythema, peeling, dryness, burning, and itching. Tretinoin gel microsphere (TGM) formulations were developed to minimize these effects. A lower-strength TGM formulation may be desirable to further reduce exposure to tretinoin. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety profile of a lower-dose TGM (0.04%) formulation compared with TGM 0.1% for the treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris. METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, Phase IV dose-ranging study, patients with facial acne were randomized to apply either TGM 0.04% or TGM 0.1% to the face each night for 12 weeks. Patients must have discontinued systemic retinoid treatment for at least 1 year before the study and were not to have used any topical retinoids, systemic antibiotics, nicotinamide, or systemic steroids for at least 1 month. All other topical medications applied to the face (including corticosteroids, antimicrobials, salicylic acid, and benzoyl peroxide) were to be discontinued at least 2 weeks before the study. End points were the acne lesion count (total, inflammatory, and noninflammatory lesions) and the investigators' and patients' assessments of improvement. Adverse events (including severity and relationship to treatment) and signs and symptoms of cutaneous irritation at the treatment site were monitored at each study visit. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-six patients (78 TGM 0.04%, 78 TGM 0.1%) were randomized and received treatment. Patients ranged in age from 12 to 41 years (mean, 18.4 years) and were predominantly white (n = 89 [57.1%]) and male (n = 80 [51.3%]). Both TGM 0.04% and TGM 0.1% were associated with a reduction from baseline in total, inflammatory, and noninflammatory lesions. The differences between groups in the change in lesion counts from baseline to weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 were not statistically significant. However, there was a greater reduction in inflammatory lesions at week 2 for TGM 0.1% compared with TGM 0.04% (14.8% vs 6.0%, respectively; P < 0.047). Both treatment groups had similar improvements in the investigators' global evaluation and the patients' assessment of the response to treatment. Both TGM 0.04% and TGM 0.1% were well tolerated. The most common adverse events were skin-associated burning sensation (2.6% in the TGM 0.04% group and 7.7% in the TGM 0.1% group) and irritation (6.4% and 3.8%, respectively). In the TGM 0.04% group, significantly fewer patients experienced dryness of the treatment area during the early phase of treatment (P < 0.027). However, for other measures of cutaneous irritation (peeling, burning/stinging, and itching), either there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups or, in the case of erythema, there was a significant difference in favor of TGM 0.1% (P = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Both TGM 0.04% and TGM 0.1% were associated with reductions in lesion counts in these patients with mild to moderate facial acne. Both concentrations were generally well tolerated. The results suggested an early (week 2) incremental benefit for the use of TGM 0.1% in the treatment of inflammatory lesions. "
"Abstract: Leprosy type 1 reactions (T1R) are immune-mediated events with inflammation of peripheral nerves and skin. We report the clinical outcomes of a closely monitored open prospective trial in which eight Nepali and 33 Ethiopian patients with T1Rs were treated with an Indian generic formulation of ciclosporin (Cn; 5-7.5 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks and followed up for 24 weeks after starting treatment. Outcomes were measured using a clinical severity score. Among the Nepalis, 75-100% improved in all acute clinical parameters; 67-100% patients maintained improvement, except for those with acute sensory nerve impairment among whom 67% relapsed after stopping treatment. The skin lesions of all Ethiopians on 5 mg/kg/day of Cn improved and 50-60% had peripheral nerve function improvement. Most Ethiopians needed a higher dose of Cn to improve nerve impairment and neuritis, and 50-78% of them developed worse clinical severity scores when Cn was stopped. Four Ethiopians and two Nepalis developed elevated serum creatinine levels on 7.5 mg/kg/day Cn, and three (9%) Ethiopians developed treatable hypertension. This suggests that Cn monotherapy is an effective treatment for severe T1R with few adverse effects. A dose of 5 mg/kg/day seems efficacious in Nepalis, but a higher dose may be required in Ethiopian patients. "
"BACKGROUND: Topical retinoids, including adapalene and tazarotene, are a primary treatment choice for patients with acne. Adapalene is currently marketed in a 0.1% concentration in gel and cream formulation. A new gel containing a higher concentration (0.3%) of adapalene has been developed. In clinical studies, adapalene 0.1% concentration has proven to be better tolerated than other retinoids in skin treatment. However, the tolerability of adapalene gel 0.3% has yet to be compared to other topical retinoids. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the local cutaneous tolerability of adapalene gel 0.3% once daily versus tazarotene cream 0.05% once daily. METHODS: Subjects reported to the investigative site each day Monday through Friday, cleansed the faced and then applied adapalene 0.3% gel to one side of the face and tazarotene 0.05% cream to the other in the presence of study personnel. For the weekends, subjects were instructed to apply the treatment at home according to the same procedure. Tolerability was assessed during each weekday visit. The study lasted for 3 weeks. RESULTS: Tolerability results for adapalene 0.3% gel and tazarotene 0.05% cream were statistically similar throughout the study. Investigator-assessed overall tolerability was in favor of adapalene at days 19 and 22 (P=.043). A cosmetic acceptability survey also showed results were better for adapalene 0.3% gel. CONCLUSION: Adapalene gel 0.3% is very well-tolerated with good cosmetic acceptability. "
"Abstract: Clindamycin phosphate 1.2% and tretinoin 0.025% gel (CLIN/RA gel [ZIANA Gel]) is a novel topical combination agent approved by the FDA for the treatment of acne vulgaris in patients 12 years of age or older. A solution of clindamycin phosphate 1.2% combined with partially solubilized and crystalline tretinoin 0.025% suspended in an aqueous-based, alcohol-free gel formulation, CLIN/RA gel was studied in 2 randomized, vehicle-controlled trials involving more than 4,500 patients. Efficacy results from these studies showed that treatment with the combination significantly reduced lesion counts and improved patients' overall appearance to a greater extent than the individual components. Individual ingredients and the combination were well-tolerated. Among those treated with the combination formulation, discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 1% or less. "
"BACKGROUND: Although combined use of tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid; atRA) and hydroquinone improves various hyperpigmented lesions, the pharmacologic instability of atRA and atRA-induced irritant dermatitis are difficult unsolved problems. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of a newly formulated gel containing inorganic-coated atRA nanoscale particles (nano-atRA gel). METHODS: Nano-atRA gel was used in our two-phased bleaching protocol: 5% hydroquinone and 7% lactic acid ointment were used along with nano-atRA gel in the bleaching phase (2-8 weeks), and 5% hydroquinone and 7% ascorbic acid ointment were used alone during the healing phase (4-8 weeks). Eighty-four patients with facial hyperpigmented lesions were enrolled in this study, and 77 of them (88 lesions) followed up for more than 10 weeks were analyzed. RESULTS: Hyperpigmentation was improved in 84 of 88 lesions (95.5%) after a mean treatment period of 14.3 weeks and was almost eliminated in 52 lesions (59.1%). Nano-atRA gel caused exfoliation and scaling similar to that seen with conventional atRA gel, whereas the erythema seen in the bleaching phase appeared to be weaker. CONCLUSION: Nano-atRA gel can improve hyperpigmentation to a similar extent as conventional atRA gel. It also induces irritant dermatitis, but with less erythema. "
"Abstract: Despite the decrease in opportunistic infections associated with HIV in the highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) era, a significant number of patients still present with skin pathology, some of which can be attributed directly or indirectly to antiretroviral therapy. The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors exhibit a class effect with regard to skin adverse manifestations, and the spectrum of disease can vary from a mild morbilliform rash to Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Certain protease inhibitors are associated with rash, and indinavir causes retinoid-like manifestations such as paronychia, alopecia, ingrown toe-nails, and curling of straight hair. Abacavir, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, is notorious for causing a hypersensitivity reaction in select patients. The fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide causes injection-site reactions in the overwhelming majority of patients, although a new method of delivery has decreased the rate and severity of these reactions. A syndrome of lipoatrophy with or without lipohypertrophy, often termed lipodystrophy, has been described in patients receiving HAART. Potential management of lipoatrophy includes switching antiretrovirals and surgical treatment with facial fillers. Lastly, skin manifestations of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, including herpes zoster and warts, must be recognized and treated accordingly. In the evaluation of the individual HIV-infected patient receiving antiretroviral therapy who presents with a skin disorder, clinicians should consider the CD4 cell count as a marker of the degree of immunodeficiency, the specific antiretrovirals used, and the timing of the initiation of antiretroviral therapy in order to formulate a rational differential diagnosis. Management should be individualized based on the specific drug that is implicated and the severity of the reaction. "
"Abstract: The objective of this investigation was to develop solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) of tretinoin (TRE) with the help of facile and simple emulsification-solvent diffusion (ESD) technique and to evaluate the viability of an SLN based gel in improving topical delivery of TRE. The feasibility of fabricating SLN of TRE by the ESD method was successfully demonstrated in this investigation. The developed SLN were characterized for particle size, polydispersity index, entrapment efficiency of TRE and morphology. Studies were carried out to evaluate the ability of SLN in improving the photostability of TRE as compared to TRE in methanol. Encapsulation of TRE in SLN resulted in a significant improvement in its photostability in comparison to methanolic TRE solution and also prevented its isomerization. Furthermore, the skin irritation studies carried out on rabbits showed that SLN based TRE gel is significantly less irritating to skin as compared to marketed TRE cream and clearly indicated its potential in improving the skin tolerability of TRE. In vitro permeation studies through rat skin indicated that an SLN based TRE gel has permeation profile comparable to that of the marketed TRE cream. "
"Abstract: Oral acitretin is currently indicated for the treatment of severe psoriasis in adults, but its use is limited by systemic side effects and teratogenicity. Topical administration of acitretin may lessen the risk of systemic toxicity while increasing local bioavailability in the skin. The effects of topical acitretin on reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) and Rhino mice were investigated and compared to those of currently marketed topical retinoids: tretinoin and tazarotene. In acitretin-treated RHE cultures, there was a reduction in keratohyalin granules and filaggrin expression in the stratum granulosum, a loss of keratin 10 expression in the stratum spinosum, and an increase in keratin 19 expression in all viable cell layers. All retinoids showed similar signs of activity in RHE cultures. Furthermore, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1alpha and IL-8 in RHE cultures was less pronounced with acitretin compared to tretinoin- and tazarotene-containing formulations, suggesting that acitretin may be less irritating. In Rhino mice, acitretin induced a local, dose-dependent reduction in utricle diameter after seven daily dermal doses. A similar effect was observed in tretinoin- and tazarotene-treated mice. Our data suggest that topical application of acitretin may have a therapeutic benefit in the local management of keratinization disorders. "
"Abstract: This paper describes the effect on Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of the combination of inorganic and organic filters in sunscreen products as determined by an in vitro method. O/W emulsions containing inorganic filters, such as titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, combined with 18 EU-authorized UV-B organic filters were tested. SPF measurements were carried out using a spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. This study observed a synergic effect when titanium dioxide was combined with either anisotriazine or octyldimethylPABA. The combination of zinc oxide with 11 UV-B organic filters also exhibited a similar synergy; however, the measured SPF was systematically lower than the protection factor achieved with titanium dioxide. "
"Abstract: The development of solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) containing all-trans retinoic acid (RA) is an interesting approach to topical treatment of acne. SLN has potential for controlled release and follicular penetration, which can reduce adverse effects in comparison with conventional formulations. However, the encapsulation efficiency (EE) of RA in SLN is usually low, unless a high surfactant/lipid ratio is used. The aim of this work was to develop SLN with high EE using a low surfactant/lipid ratio. Different formulations of RA-loaded SLN were prepared using glyceryl behenate as lipid matrix. The particle size, EE, zeta potential and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were investigated. High EE in SLN was obtained with addition of amines. These results indicate that the utilization of amines is an interesting approach to improve the EE of RA in SLN using a low surfactant/lipid ratio. "
"PURPOSE: Ovarian suppression with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists is an effective adjuvant treatment for premenopausal women with estrogen receptor (ER) -positive breast cancer. Whereas monthly LHRH agonist therapy has been well established, the value of every-3-months (3-monthly) formulations is unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized phase III trial was performed to compare the 3-monthly depot LHRH agonist leuprorelin acetate (LAD-3M; n = 299) and chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF; n = 300) in pre- or perimenopausal patients with ER-positive, node-positive breast cancer. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 5.8 years, recurrence-free survival was similar for patients treated with LAD-3M or CMF (hazard ratio [HR], 1.19; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.51; P = .15). There was no substantial heterogeneity in the relative treatment effect among subgroups defined by age, progesterone receptor (PR) status, nodal status, hormone levels, or menstrual recovery after treatment. Exploratory overall survival analysis favored LAD-3M (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.99; P = .005). Chemotherapy-related adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, and alopecia were more common with CMF, whereas symptoms of estrogen suppression such as hot flushes and sweating were initially more pronounced with LAD-3M. CONCLUSION: The 3-monthly depot LHRH-agonist leuprorelin acetate is an effective adjuvant treatment in premenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive, node-positive breast cancer that is not inferior to CMF. "
"Abstract: In this work, a hydrogel-thickened microemulsion (HTM) was investigated for delivering an extremely low concentration of drug molecule. The pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed using isopropyl myristate (IPM), Tween 80, propylene glycol and water. The various HTM were prepared and characterized. We described that HTM has the combination of o/w microstructure of microemulsion and the three-dimensional gel network of hydrogel in continuous phase using transmission electron microscope. The stability tests showed that HTM had good stability. The influence of the addition of hydrogel into microemulsions on the viscosity and permeation ability is investigated. The abilities of HTM to deliver an extremely low concentration of triptolide as a model drug were evaluated using the in vitro permeation studies. The permeation rates of triptolide from various HTM were 2.2-3.6 times over that from the control hydrogel. The addition of 2% menthol into HTM consisting of 3% IPM, 30% Tween 80, 15% propylene glycol, 0.75% carbomer 940 resulted in the highest permeation rate of 0.105+/-0.006microcm(-2)h(-1), which was 5.8 times over control gel. The powerful permeation enhancing ability of HTM with a suitable viscosity makes it promising alternative carrier for transdermal administration of drug molecule at an extremely low concentration. "
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Ebastine is a long-acting, second-generation selective histamine H(1) receptor antagonist. The pharmacodynamics of a new 10mg fast-dissolving tablet (FDT) oral lyophilisate tablet formulation of ebastine were compared with those of desloratadine and placebo following histamine skin intradermal test challenge. The acceptability of the FDT was also assessed. METHODS: This was a double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, randomised, crossover, three-period study in 36 healthy adults. The histamine skin intradermal test (0.05 mL of 100 microg/mL solution) was administered into volunteers' forearms, and wheal area was measured 15 minutes later. Ebastine 10 mg FDT, desloratadine 5mg capsule or placebo were given on days 1-5. On day 1, a skin intradermal test was performed at baseline, then every 20 minutes for 2 hours after administration and at 24 hours. The final skin intradermal test was on day 6, 24 hours after the last drug dose. Subjective symptoms (itching, heat and pain) were assessed on day 1 for 2 hours following the first drug dose. There was a washout period of 7-10 days between treatments. At study end, the acceptability of the new ebastine formulation was evaluated using a questionnaire. RESULTS: Ebastine 10mg inhibited the wheal response to histamine significantly more than desloratadine 5 mg or placebo 24 hours after 5 days' treatment (mean difference between treatments in wheal area reduction from baseline: 26.7%, p < 0.0001; 46.9%, p < 0.0001, respectively), and after 24 hours on day 1 (mean difference: 16.2%, p = 0.0082; 34.2%, p < 0.0001, respectively). The results with desloratadine were also significantly different from placebo on day 1 and after 5 days, but less than with ebastine after 5 days (difference, desloratadine vs placebo: 20.2%, p = 0.0001). No differences in itching, heat and pain were observed between the treatments. Most participants (70%) preferred the FDT, and all reported that it made adherence easier. CONCLUSION: Ebastine 10 mg FDT demonstrated significantly superior antihistamine activity compared with desloratadine and placebo. "
"BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet (UV) exposure of human skin causes immunosuppression that contributes to the growth of skin cancer. The contribution of UVA in these processes is still a matter of debate. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study was first to find a dose-response effect of UVA exposure on human epidermal antigen-presenting cell (APC) activity and to evaluate the protective capacity of two sunscreen formulations against a high level of acute UVA exposure. We also tried to evaluate the protective capacity afforded by the same sunscreens against UVA-induced clinical changes such as redness and pigmentation. METHODS: The functional assessment of the alloantigen-presenting capacity of epidermal cells prepared from skin keratotome samples 3 days after UVA exposure was measured with a mixed epidermal cell-lymphocyte reaction (MECLR) in each healthy volunteer (n = 16). Redness and pigmentation were assessed by chromametry 24 h after exposure to a single UVA dose. RESULTS: In vivo UVA exposure to 15, 30 and 60 J cm(-2) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in purified allogeneic T cell (CD4+ T cells) proliferation induced by UVA-irradiated epidermal cells. The epidermal APC function was significantly decreased with a suberythemal exposure corresponding to 15 J cm(-2). The decrease, partial and not statistically different between 30 and 60 J cm(-2), exhibits a plateau-response effect. There was no correlation between the decrease of the epidermal APC function and the intensity of erythema and persistent pigment darkening. Both sunscreen formulations strongly inhibited the UVA-induced reduction of MECLR at 90 J cm(-2). CONCLUSION: Our results clearly demonstrate that UVA impairs the APC activity of the epidermal cells and thus may contribute to UV-induced immunosuppression in humans. They also indicate that erythema and immunosuppression have different dose-response curves in the UVA range. The two sunscreen formulations afforded a significant protection against the decrease in epidermal APC activity induced by exposure to a high UVA dose (90 J cm(-2)). "
"BACKGROUND: Cuscuta reflexa (Roxb.), Citrullus colocynthis (Schrad.), and Eclipta alba (Hassk.) are traditionally acclaimed herbs for their hair growth-promoting potential. Aim In the present study, it was envisaged to prepare herbal formulations containing petroleum ether extracts of the three herbs in varying ratio and evaluating the formulations for the hair growth-promoting activity. METHODS: The formulations as well as minoxidil (2%) solution (positive control) were applied topically on shaved skin of rats, and the time required for initiation and completion of hair growth cycle was recorded. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Hair growth initiation time was markedly reduced to one third on treatment with the prepared formulation compared with control animals. The time required for complete hair growth was also reduced by 32%. Quantitative analysis of hair growth cycle after treatment with formulations and minoxidil (2%) exhibited greater number of hair follicles in anagenic phase compared with control. The results thus corroborate with the traditionally acclaimed hair growth-promoting capabilities of the plants. The prepared formulation also holds potential for treatment of alopecia. "
"BACKGROUND: Long-term treatment with a high-strength hydroquinone (HQ) cream (usually 4% HQ) is the mainstay therapy for hyperpigmentation disorders. Instability and high potential for irritancy hinders patient compliance. A new 4% HQ preparation has been designed with an innovative antioxidant for stability and a biomimetic of an herbal extract for skin calming. AIMS: To investigate the activity, stability, and irritancy of a new HQ cream. METHODS: To evaluate the new HQ cream in comparison with commercial 4% HQ creams for stability by temperature stress test, for irritancy by repeated-insult patch test on human subjects, and for lightening effect using the MelanoDerm B skin equivalent model. RESULTS: The new HQ is more resistant to browning and shows less irritancy than three commercially available 4% HQ products. It has comparable bleaching effect with faster onset than a 4% HQ product containing 0.05% tretinoin and 0.01% fluocinolone acetonide. CONCLUSION: Based on its improved stability, lower irritancy, and activity in skin lightening, the new approach to the formulation of 4% HQ may improve therapeutic outcomes by improving patient compliance to dosing.

"Abstract: The calcineurin inhibitors, cyclosporine (ciclosporin) [microemulsion] and tacrolimus, are the principal immunosuppressants prescribed for adult and pediatric renal transplantation. For pediatric patients, both drugs should be dosed per body surface area, and pharmacokinetic monitoring is mandatory. While monitoring of the trough levels may suffice for tacrolimus, cyclosporine therapy that utilizes the microemulsion formulation requires additional monitoring (e.g. determination of 2-hour post-dose levels). In a well designed randomized study in children, as in studies in adults, there was no difference in short-term patient and graft survival with cyclosporine microemulsion and tacrolimus. However, tacrolimus was significantly more effective than cyclosporine microemulsion in preventing acute rejection after renal transplantation when used in conjunction with azathioprine and corticosteroids. With regard to long-term outcome, the difference in acute rejection episodes resulted in a better glomerular filtration rate at 1 year after transplantation and eventually in better graft survival 4 years after renal transplantation. Whether this difference persists when calcineurin inhibitors are used in combination with mycophenolate mofetil has not been determined. The prevalence of hypomagnesemia was higher in the tacrolimus group whereas hypertrichosis and gingival hyperplasia occurred more frequently in the cyclosporine group. In contrast with adults, the incidence of post-transplantation diabetes mellitus was not significantly different between tacrolimus- and cyclosporine-treated patients. There was also no difference with regard to post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder. Medication costs were similar, but in view of the lower rejection episodes and better long-term graft survival as well as the more favorable cosmetic side effect profile, tacrolimus may be preferable. The recommendation drawn from the available data is that both cyclosporine and tacrolimus can be used safely and effectively in children. We recommend that cyclosporine should be chosen when patients experience tacrolimus-related adverse events. "
"Abstract: The aim of the study was to assess an Ectoin formulation with regard to the antiageing properties. The study was designed as a monocentric, randomized, double-blind application test, in order to ensure the compatibility and the efficacy of Ectoin in comparison to a vehicle emulsion. A total of 104 voluntary healthy female test subjects were included in the study. Moisturizing properties as well as other parameters of skin ageing, like skin surface structure and skin elasticity, were determined for treatment A (vehicle) and treatment B (with 2% Ectoin) versus an untreated control. Statistical evaluations according to the Wilcoxon rank-sum test indicate a general preference for the Ectoin treatment by the test subjects in both the application and the efficacy tests. None of the participating test subjects had any side effects throughout the study. In terms of antiageing properties, previous in vitro studies could be confirmed by this clinical trial, clarifying that the natural cell protection concept of Ectoin is transferable to skin care with manifold benefits.

"INTRODUCTION: A phase I study was performed to establish the minimum effective dose safety of the topical 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor lovastatin (FP252S) in preventing chemotherapy-induced alopecia in cohorts of three patients receiving their first doses of chemotherapy with doxorubicin (eight patients) or taxanes (four patients). RESULTS: One patient at the first dose level receiving doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide had only grade 1 hair loss at 3 weeks. At dose level 2, one patient on doxorubicin took more than 4 weeks to lose her hair and another on docetaxel retained some hair throughout her chemotherapy. At level 3, one patient had grade 2 hair loss at week 4 and another on docetaxel for 6 cycles showed evidence of hair growth between cycles. There were no grade 3 or 4 toxicities, but at the fourth dose level, no higher concentrations could be formulated. DISCUSSION: Lovastatin was well-tolerated at the maximum concentration achievable but showed little efficacy. "
"Abstract: Topical therapy for rosacea aims to reduce inflammatory lesions and decrease erythema but can carry side effects such as stinging, pruritus, and burning. Metronidazole and azelaic acid gel 15% are U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved for the treatment of rosacea. The current study was conducted to assess the cumulative irritation potential of 2 formulations of metronidazole 0.75% gel and 1% gel--and azelaic acid gel 15% over 21 days (N=36). Results of this study demonstrated a significantly greater poten tial for irritation from azelaic acid compared with metronidazole gel 0.75% (P < .0001), which had significantly greater potential for irritation compared with metronidazole gel 1% (P = .0054). Metronidazole gel 1% had a similar profile to white petrolatum. "
"Abstract: The objective of this study was to prepare the microemulsion of methotrexate (M-MTX) for oral use and to investigate the suppressive effect of MTX-loaded microemulsion on MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. At the same time this effect of M-MTX was compared with those of a solution of the drug (Sol-MTX). Microemulsion was composed of soybean oil as oil phase, a mixture of Cremophore EL and Span 80 as surfactants, and isopropyl alcohol as co-surfactant, and 0.2 N NaOH as the aqueous phase. MTX was added into microemulsion at the last stage. We clearly demonstrated that M-MTX had a significant cytotoxic effect on breast cancer cell lines and the cytotoxic effect of M-MTX was significantly more than that of solutions (p < 0.05) and IC(50) value for M-MTX was 40 ng/mL. We also examined M-MTX and Sol-MTX on a model biological environmental model. For this purpose a gastrointestinal cell culture model, the Caco-2 cell line, was used to investigate the cytotoxic effects of the polymeric carrier and its effect on the cell monolayer integrity. The differences between the viability of cells for M-MTX and Sol-MTX were significantly different when applied to ANOVA according to 2 x 8 factorial randomized design (p:0.016; for alpha: 0.05, power : 0.695). According to the in vitro cytotoxicity studies, we concluded that when MTX was incorporated into the microemulsion (M-MTX), which is a new drug carrier system, it suppresses tumour cell growth on multiple tumor lines. These results indicate that M-MTX may exert a low cytotoxic effect on normal cells and may be effective as an antitumor agent that induces apoptosis. "
"Abstract: Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) microspheres of ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHM) were prepared by emulsion solvent evaporation method to improve its photostability and effectiveness as sunscreening agent. Process parameters like stirring speed and aqueous polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) concentration were analyzed in order to optimize the formulations. Shape and surface morphology of the microspheres were examined using scanning electron microscopy. Particle size of the microspheres was determined using laser diffraction particle size analyzer. The PMMA microspheres of EHM were incorporated in water-removable cream base. The in vitro drug release of EHM in pH 7.4 was performed using dialysis membrane. Thin layer chromatography was performed to determine photostability of EHM inside the microspheres. The formulations were evaluated for sun protection factor (SPF) and minimum erythema dose (MED) in albino rats. Cream base formulation containing microspheres prepared using EHM:PMMA in ratio of 1:3 (C(3)) showed slowest drug (EHM) release and those prepared with EHM: PMMA in ratio of 1:1 showed fastest release. The cream base formulations containing EHM loaded microspheres had shown better SPF (more than 16.0) as compared to formulation C(d) that contained 3% free EHM as sunscreen agent and showed SPF 4.66. These studies revealed that the incorporation of EHM loaded PMMA microspheres into cream base had greatly increased the efficacy of sunscreen formulation approximately four times. Further, photostability was also shown to be improved in PMMA microspheres. "
Abstract: The current method of choice for astronauts to treat space motion sickness is an intra-muscular injection of promethazine hydrochloride (PMZ HCl) which is invasive and causes considerable local irritation and discomfort at the site of injection. Intra-nasal delivery is considered a feasible alternative route for administration of medications to treat space motion sickness. The purpose of this research is to develop a PMZ HCl formulation that can be administered intra-nasally without irritation (i.e. leukocyte infiltration) in the nasal epithelium when dosed at PMZ HCl concentrations greater than the cytotoxic limit. The biocompatibility of PMZ HCl was tested in vitro and was shown to be cytotoxic at concentrations greater than 10(-5) molar regardless of pH. A controlled-release microencapsulated dosage formulation was developed using spinning disk atomization and release rates for the PMZ HCl microcapsules were determined in phosphate buffered saline. An animal study was conducted to determine the irritation response of rat nasal mucosa when dosed with encapsulated and non-encapsulated PMZ HCl. 
"Abstract: The objective of this study was to assess the oncogenic potential of trans-capsaicin when administered weekly via topical application to the dorsal skin of Tg.AC mice for 26 weeks. Male and female Tg.AC mice (25 mice/sex/group) received dose formulations containing trans-capsaicin dissolved in diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (DGME). The positive control was tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) dissolved in DGME. Appropriate controls, including a topical lidocaine local anesthetic pretreatment (4%w/w), were maintained. All groups were dosed once weekly, except for the TPA group, which was dosed twice per week. Analysis of the macroscopic observations after the final sacrifice revealed no noteworthy treatment-related findings, with the exception of dermal masses that were randomly dispersed throughout all treatment groups for both males and females. The frequency of dermal masses in the capsaicin-treated groups (at a dose level of up to 102 mg/kg and an application rate of 25.6 mg/cm2/kg/week) was not elevated in comparison to either concurrent vehicle or untreated controls. In contrast, a notable increase in the frequency of dermal masses was observed in the TPA-treated mice compared to both the concurrent vehicle and untreated controls. Dermal application of capsaicin resulted in no increased incidence of preneoplastic or neoplastic skin lesions. In contrast, over half the male and female mice exposed to TPA had multiple skin papillomas; the majority of the TPA-treated animals either died early or was humanely euthanized due to tumor load. Spontaneously occurring neoplasms were not appreciably increased in capsaicin-treated animals. Capsaicin-related non-neoplastic microscopic findings were seen sporadically in both genders and included acanthosis, hyperkeratosis/parakeratosis (primarily females), epidermal crusts, subepidermal fibrosis, epidermal ulcerations/erosions, and chronic-active inflammation. There was no evidence of a dose response in either the incidence or severity of these findings. The lidocaine- (at a dose level of 162 mg/kg and at an application rate of 40.5 mg/cm2/kg/week) and DGME-treated (at a dose level of 4.0 g/kg and at an application rate of 1 g/cm2/kg/week) control groups also did not display any evidence of increase in dermal masses. Based on these results, trans-capsaicin, lidocaine, and DGME should be considered nononcogenic in the Tg.AC mouse dermal model. "
"Abstract: Many modern cosmetic or sunscreen products contain nano-sized components. Nanoemulsions are transparent and have unique tactile and texture properties; nanocapsule, nanosome, noisome, or liposome formulations contain small vesicles (range: 50 to 5000 nm) consisting of traditional cosmetic materials that protect light-or oxygen-sensitive cosmetic ingredients. Transdermal delivery and cosmetic research suggests that vesicle materials may penetrate the stratum corneum (SC) of the human skin, but not into living skin. Depending on the physical/chemical properties of the ingredient and the formulation, nano-sized formulations may enhance or reduce skin penetration, albeit at a limited rate. Modern sunscreens contain insoluble titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) or zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NP), which are colorless and reflect/scatter ultraviolet (UV) more efficiently than larger particles. Most available theoretical and experimental evidence suggests that insoluble NP do not penetrate into or through normal as well as compromised human skin. Oral and topical toxicity data suggest that TiO(2) and ZnO NP have low systemic toxicity and are well tolerated on the skin. In vitro cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and photogenotoxicity studies on TiO(2) or other insoluble NP reporting uptake by cells, oxidative cell damage, or genotoxicity should be interpreted with caution, since such toxicities may be secondary to phagocytosis of mammalian cells exposed to high concentrations of insoluble particles. Caution needs to be exercised concerning topical exposure to other NP that either have characteristics enabling some skin penetration and/or have inherently toxic constituents. Studies on wear debris particles from surgical implants and other toxicity studies on insoluble particles support the traditional toxicology view that the hazard of small particles is mainly defined by the intrinsic toxicity of particles, as distinct from their particle size. There is little evidence supporting the principle that smaller particles have greater effects on the skin or other tissues or produce novel toxicities relative to micro-sized materials. Overall, the current weight of evidence suggests that nano-materials such as nano-sized vesicles or TiO(2) and ZnO nanoparticles currently used in cosmetic preparations or sunscreens pose no risk to human skin or human health, although other NP may have properties that warrant safety evaluation on a case-by-case basis before human use.

"Abstract: Skin does not react in an identical way to the action of chemicals over all anatomic sites. Accordingly, distinct regional differences have been described in relation to irritancy. The present study assesses the regional variations of stratum corneum (SC) reactivity to 3 proprietary antiseptic solutions (povidone iodine (PVP-I), 70 mg/ml and 100 mg/ml, and chlorhexidine digluconate 50 mg/ml) using the corneoxenometry (CXM) bioassay. SC was harvested from the volar forearm, the forehead and the back in 30 young adults. Each SC sample was covered by one of the neat test product or deionized water for 2 hr at 20 degrees C. The intrinsic staining property of each antiseptic on SC was assessed by reflectance colorimetry. For the CXM bioassay, samples were then stained by a toluidine blue-basic fuschin solution in order to show protein denaturation induced by the test products. The colorimetric index of mildness (CIM = L*- Chroma C*) was measured by colorimetry. Data show that PVP-I 100 mg/ml was the least reactive antiseptic to the SC. It was significantly milder than the 2 other antiseptics. "
"Abstract: Lipoid pneumonia is a rare disease resulting from the micro-aspiration of lipid formulations. Making a diagnosis of lipoid pneumonia requires a high degree of clinical suspicion. Herein, we report the case of a female patient with a history of breast cancer, presenting progressive dyspnea and cough, together with radiological findings of bilateral pulmonary infiltrate. The working diagnosis of lymphangitic carcinomatosis, for which chemotherapy would be indicated, was called into question based on the high-resolution computed tomography findings and on the fact that the patient had a history of chronic ingestion of laxatives containing mineral oil. A lung biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of lipoid pneumonia, which should always be considered in patients with diffuse lung disease having been exposed to potential causative agents. "
"Abstract: The cyclosporine-loaded poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by the emulsion-diffusion-evaporation method and were optimized for particle size and entrapment efficiency. The optimized particles were 143.3+/-8.7 nm in size with narrow size distribution and 71.9+/-1.7% entrapment efficiency at 20% w/w initial drug loading when prepared with 0.1% w/v of Didodecylmethylammonium bromide (DMAB) as stabilizer. These particulate carriers exhibited controlled in vitro release of cyclosporine for 23 days at a nearly constant rate and showed very good hemocompatibility in vitro. The nanoparticulate formulation showed significantly higher intestinal uptake as compared to Sandimmune Neoral and cyclosporine suspension. The relative bioavailability of nanoparticulate formulation was found to be 119.2% as compared to Sandimmune Neoral. A marked difference in the pharmacokinetic profile between nanoparticulate and Sandimmune Neoral formulations was observed where nanoparticulate formulation showed controlled release of cyclosporine over 5 days, on the other hand, the marketed formulation showed a sharp Cmax with a 3-day release profile. The nanoparticulate formulation exerted significantly lower nephrotoxicity in the rats as compared to Sandimmune Neoral, which was evidenced by lower blood urea nitrogen (BUN), plasma creatinine (PC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in plasma and kidney. The results were further supported by the histopathological changes in kidneys. Together, these results indicate that PLGA NPs have greater potential for oral delivery of cyclosporine. "
"PURPOSE: Ellagic acid (EA), a dietary antioxidant associated with poor biopharmaceutical properties, was encapsulated into poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and polycaprolactone (PCL) nanoparticles to improve oral bioavailability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EA-loaded nanoparticles were prepared following emulsion-diffusion-evaporation method employing didodecyldimethyl ammonium bromide (DMAB) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as stabilizers. In vitro release was investigated in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The in situ permeation studies were performed in rats. The antioxidant potential of the DMAB-stabilized nanoparticulate formulations was evaluated against cyclosporine A (CyA)-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. RESULTS: EA-loaded PLGA and PCL nanoparticles have been successfully prepared employing PEG 400 as co-solvent to solubilize EA. The stabilizers influenced the particle size and encapsulation efficiency. DMAB when used as stabilizer to particles of approximately 120 nm and approximately 50% encapsulation, whereas PVA led to approximately 290 nm and approximately 60% encapsulation at 5% initial loading (w/w of polymer). The in vitro release of EA from the nanoparticles followed Higuchi's square root pattern and was faster with PVA-stabilized particles in comparison to those stabilized with DMAB. From the in situ permeation studies in rats, it was evident that intestinal uptake of EA as DMAB-stabilized nanoparticles was significantly higher as compared to the sodium carboxymethyl cellulose suspension and the PVA-stabilized particles. EA and EA nanoparticles were able to prevent the CyA-induced nephrotoxicity in rats as evident by biochemical parameters as well as kidney histopathology. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates the potential of EA nanoparticulate formulations in the prevention of CyA-induced nephrotoxicity at three times lower dose suggesting improved oral bioavailability of EA.

"Abstract: Psoriasis is a chronic skin disorder affecting up to 2.5% of the world's population. Despite the myriad treatment options available, there is no uniformly accepted therapeutic approach for moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The objective of this review is to evaluate the relative efficacy and safety of available therapeutic options and to formulate general recommendations for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. MEDLINE and Evidence Based Medicine (Cochrane) were used to perform a comprehensive search of the literature from 1986 to 2006. The most scientifically rigorous clinical trial published in the literature was selected for Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) comparison. Only information from clinical trials, human subjects and English language journals are reported in this study. The percentage of PASI 75 reduction at approximately 12 weeks obtained by the following treatment options were: Goeckerman and RePUVA, 100%; calcipotriene plus PUVA, 87%; ciclosporin, 78.2-80.3%; infliximab, 80%; adalimumab 40 mg every other week, 53% and 40 mg/week, 80%; PUVA, 63%; methotrexate, 60%; NB-UVB, 55%; acitretin 52%; etanercept 50 mg twice weekly, 49% and 25 mg twice weekly, 34%; efalizumab, 31.4%; and alefacept 21%. Psoriatic treatments with safer profiles compared with other agents include bath PUVA, Goeckerman and RePUVA. Based on the literature review of efficacy and safety of biologics and prebiologic treatment options for moderate-to-severe psoriasis, the risk:benefit ratio seems most favorable for Goeckerman and RePUVA, followed by either etanercept or adalimumab.

Abstract: The changing face of America highlights the importance of understanding dermatologic conditions of skin of color. Hyperpigmentation is the most common and distressing condition afflicting this unique subset of the population. Dermatologists need to familiarize themselves with cosmeceutical skin lightening agents and corrective camouflage formulations. This article will highlight common over-the-counter agents addressing their advantages and disadvantages. Combination agents with sunscreen will often be the most effective treatment available. 
"AIM: Cyclosporine is known to improve proteinuria in nephrotic syndrome (NS), but is also associated with drug-related renal impairment. In this case series, therapeutic drug monitoring using the absorption profile was applied to adults with NS to investigate the efficacy and safety of once-daily administration of cyclosporine microemulsion (CSAME). METHODS: Twenty patients received CSAME starting at 100-175 mg/day (1.4-3.1 mg/kg per day) once daily after breakfast. The area under the concentration-time curve up to 4 h after administration of cyclosporine (AUC(0-4 h)) was determined in each patient within 1 week after the start of CSAME treatment. Thereafter, the dose of CSAME was adjusted according to the absorption profile. RESULTS: After 6 months, treatment with CSAME improved efficacy test values compared with those prior to treatment, and the severe nephrotic state was eliminated in all patients. No changes in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen levels were observed. The dose of CSAME was adjusted so that AUC(0-4 h) and the peak level fell within the range of target values, resulting in a significant decrease in the mean dose of cyclosporine (P = 0.0001). Time of peak level was variable among patients, but when CSAME was administered before breakfast, good absorption was achieved in all patients. CONCLUSION: By monitoring the absorption profile in patients with NS, a once-daily administration of CSAME was used to achieve both efficacy and a reduction in total exposure to the drug. Preprandial administration provided a more stable absorption profile of cyclosporine. The authors hope this method will become standard procedure during cyclosporine treatment in these patients. "
"Abstract: Dithranol is infrequently used in psoriasis in spite of excellent efficacy due to its local adverse effects. We have synthesized a novel formulation of dithranol in which the drug is entrapped in phospholipid liposomes. This formulation has shown markedly low irritation and minimal staining of skin and clothes in preliminary studies. Twenty patients with bilaterally symmetrical stable plaque psoriasis applied 0.5% dithranol lipogel to lesions over one side of the body. On the other side, 10 patients were randomized to apply pure liposomal base and 10 applied a conventional cream containing 1.15% dithranol, 1.15% salicylic acid and 5.3% coal tar in a 30-minute, short contact regimen for 6 weeks. Patients were assessed for disease severity, perilesional erythema and skin staining, pruritus and any other adverse effects at baseline, 2, 4 and 6 weeks. Both lipogel and the cream significantly reduced the total severity score compared to the liposomal base at 4 (p = 0.004) and 6 (p = 0.01) weeks. There was no significant difference in the clinical response of dithranol cream and lipogel. Markedly low incidence and severity of perilesional erythema (p<0.001) and skin staining (p<0.05) was seen with the lipogel in comparison with the cream. "
"Abstract: This study involves development of amphiphilic gels consisting solely of nonionic surfactants bearing cyclosporine and characterized for microstructure, gelation temperature, and in vitro drug release into dermis. The formulation is nonirritant and suitable for topical application. Gels consisting of cyclosporine were prepared using different methods by mixing the solid gelator (sorbitan or glyceryl fatty acid esters) and the liquid phase (liquid sorbitan esters or polysorbates) and heating them at 60 degrees C to form a clear isotropic sol phase, and cooling this sol phase to form an opaque semisolid at room temperature. Gel microstructure was examined by phase contrast microscopy while gelation temperatures were measured by melting point apparatus and differential scanning calorimetry. These amphiphilic gels were evaluated in vitro for topical as well as transdermal delivery using rat skin mounted in a Franz diffusion cell. Gel microstructures consisted mainly of clusters of tubules of gelator molecules that had aggregated upon cooling of the sol phase, forming a 3D network throughout the continuous phase. The gels demonstrated thermoreversibility with robust gel network. At temperatures near the skin surface temperature, the gels softened considerably and moreover, it facilitated the drug to accumulate in dermis, thus making an ideal delivery vehicle of cyclosporine topically that can be used in treatment of psoriasis. Thus amphiphilic gels were demonstrated as the ideal vehicle for topical use of cyclosporine. "
"Abstract: Diabetic painful neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most common causes of neuropathic pain. The management of DPN consists of excluding other causes of painful peripheral neuropathy, maximising diabetic control and using medications to alleviate pain. The precise relationship between glycaemic control and the development and severity of DPN remains controversial. In this context, drugs such as aldose reductase inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, lipid-lowering agents and alpha-lipoic acid (thioctic acid) may have a useful role to play. There is also evidence that a successful pancreatic transplant may improve symptoms over time, but the mainstay of management continues to be symptomatic control of pain with drugs. Evidence from placebo-controlled studies has shown that opioids, antiepileptic and antidepressant drugs together with capsaicin are effective for alleviating DPN. Tramadol and oxycodone have been shown to be effective in studies of limited duration but their adverse effects, such as constipation and physical dependency, may limit their usefulness as a first-line treatment for DPN. Of the antidepressant drugs, the tricyclic antidepressants have been shown to be effective for alleviating DPN. These medications are widely used but their anticholinergic and sedative properties may not be well tolerated by patients. There is also good evidence that the serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor antidepressant drugs venlafaxine and duloxetine are effective for treating DPN. However, venlafaxine may cause cardiac dysrhythmias, and patients using this medication require careful cardiac monitoring. Duloxetine appears to be less cardiotoxic and is licensed in the US and EU for alleviating DPN. The gabapentinoid group of drugs, gabapentin and pregabalin, appear to be the most evidence-based of the antiepileptic drugs for treating DPN. Large placebo-controlled studies have been performed with both of these agents. For many patients, it is still unclear what advantages pregabalin has over gabapentin for DPN. Until better evidence emerges, the potential availability of less expensive generic formulations of gabapentin, together with greater experience with its use, favour gabapentin as the main antiepileptic drug for alleviating DPN. Topiramate, lamotrigine, sodium valproate and oxcarbazepine have been shown to be effective in smaller studies but do not have the same evidence base as the gabapentinoid group of drugs. Of the newer antiepileptic drugs, lacosamide appears to be the most promising for alleviating DPN. Capsaicin has the best evidence base of all the topical agents, but local anaesthetic patches may also have a useful therapeutic role. It is not possible to nominate a single drug as the first-line treatment for DPN and there is evidence that a low-dose combination of two or more drugs rather than a single agent may provide better symptomatic relief with fewer adverse effects. Further studies are necessary to clarify the best combination(s) of treatment for DPN. "
"Abstract: There is a growing need for research into new skin- and environment-friendly surfactants. This paper focuses on a natural surfactant of an alkylpolyglucoside type, which can form both thermotropic and lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases. The aim of this study was to relate some physicochemical properties (characterised by polarisation and transmission electron microscopy, thermal analysis and rheology) of the three formulations based on cetearyl glucoside and cetearyl alcohol, to the results of in vitro and in vivo bioavailability of hydrocortisone (HC). The three formulations contained oils of different polarity (medium chain triglycerides: MG, isopropyl myristate: IPM and light liquid paraffin: LP), respectively. In vitro permeation was followed through the artificial skin constructs (ASC), while the parameters measured in vivo were erythema index: EI (using instrumental human skin blanching assay), transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and stratum corneum hydration (SCH). The vehicles based on cetearyl glucoside and cetearyl alcohol showed a complex colloidal structure of lamellar liquid-crystalline and lamellar gel-crystalline type, depending on oil polarity. Rheological profile of the vehicle was directly related to the in vitro profile of the HC permeation. In vivo results suggested that the vehicle with MG retarded the HC permeation, whereas less polar IPM and non-polar LP enhanced it. It is suggested that the enhancement is achieved either by a direct interaction with lipid lamellae of the SC or indirectly by improving skin hydration. There were no adverse effects during in vivo study, which indicates a good safety profile of this alkylpolyglucoside surfactant. "
"Abstract: Isotechnika is developing the immunosuppressive drug ISA 247, a calcineurin inhibitor that is undergoing clinical development for the treatment of psoriasis (phase III) and prevention of organ rejection after transplantation (phase II). Preclinical development for uveitis is also underway. Other autoimmune disease indications that could be explored include arthritis, type I diabetes and Crohn's disease. ISA 247 was being co-developed as R 1524 by Isotechnika and Roche. However, Roche is no longer involved in the development of this compound. Based on analysis of previously collected data, the trans-ISA 247 isomer was found to be more bioavailable and it is expected that this isomer can be administered at a lower dose compared with the previous formulation that consisted of an equivalent mixture of the two geometric isomers (cis and trans). Preclinical observations indicate that ISA 247 has the potential to be more potent and less toxic than other marketed immunosuppressants in its class used for the prevention of transplant rejection. Experiments to date suggest that ISA 247 is about three times as potent as ciclosporin, while genotoxicity studies in animals have shown that the compound has a significantly reduced tendency to cause renal toxicity. The combination of reduced toxicity and improved potency would give ISA 247 a therapeutic benefit over existing calcineurin-based treatments. Isotechnika and Roche entered into a co-development and commercialisation agreement in April 2002, with Roche gaining the exclusive worldwide marketing rights for ISA 247; Isotechnika received milestone payments of $US4 million and $CAN21.9 million in September 2002 and May 2003, respectively. The agreement was restructured in April 2004, under which Isotechnika will now solely manage and fund the clinical development of trans-ISA 247. Upon successful completion of these trials, Isotechnika will conduct at its own expense a phase IIb study in renal transplantation and phase III studies in psoriasis. Roche will have the right to opt-in to the development and commercialisation of trans-ISA 247 for transplant indications up to the end of the phase IIb renal transplantation trial. Isotechnika retains all rights to develop and commercialise the product outside of transplant indications. Under an agreement signed with Cellgate Inc. on 25 April 2006, Isotechnika has the option to obtain an exclusive licence to develop and commercialise conjugates consisting of Cellgate's patented transporter technology, for the topical delivery of ISA 247 in patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis. Cellgate will perform studies to evaluate the feasibility of using their technology to topically deliver ISA 247. In return, Isotechnika will pay Cellgate Inc. a total of $US500 000, with $US100 000 paid upfront, and the remainder at predetermined time points. Upon successful completion of the studies, Isotechnika has the option to further develop and commercialise conjugates for topical delivery of ISA 247. Isotechnika and Atrium Medical Corporation announced an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement for ISA 247 alone and in combination with TAFA 93 with respect to drug-eluting devices, in September 2005. Atrium's implantable products include those for the local, non-systemic treatment of vascular and cardiovascular disorders, soft tissue repair and other disorders. In May 2006, Isotechnika licensed ISA 247 to Lux Biosciences for ophthalmic indications. Under terms of the agreement, Lux Biosciences obtains the exclusive worldwide marketing rights to ISA 247 for treatment and prophylaxis of all ophthalmic indications. The company will be responsible for development, registration and marketing of the drug for ophthalmic indications and will make upfront and milestone payments to Isotechnika in addition to royalties on any sales. Isotechnika formalised a manufacturing agreement with Swiss-based Lonza Ltd in June 2004. Under the terms of the agreement, Lonza will manufacture sufficient quantities of trans-ISA 247 in a GMP environment for use in the company's upcoming clinical trials. Isotechnika completed the phase III SPIRIT trial of ISA 247 for psoriasis in Canada. The randomised, double-blind trial compared the efficacy of three doses of ISA 247 (0.2 mg/kg [low dose], 0.3 mg/kg [mid dose] and 0.4 mg/kg [high dose] twice daily) with placebo, with equal numbers of patients assigned to each of the four groups. Subsequent to the first 12 weeks, those patients who received placebo moved into the mid-dose group for the remaining 12 weeks of the study. Patients already receiving ISA 247 remained in their respective dosing groups for the final 12 weeks of the trial. Patients completing the 24-week SPIRIT trial were given the opportunity to continue therapy for an addditonal 36 weeks or to discontinue therapy. Those patients who chose to enrol in the extension trial were moved from the 0.2 mg/kg bid (low-dose) or 0.4 mg/kg bid (high-dose) groups into the the 0.3 bid mg/kg bid (mid dose) group. Patients who commenced the SPIRIT trial in the mid-dose group remained on the same dosage regimen for the duration of the extension trial. The goal of the extension trial is to demonstrate continued therapeutic benefit to psoriasis patients while gathering long-term safety data. So far, data has been received on 193 patients receiving treatment for a total of 48 weeks. A phase IIa trial investigating the safety and efficacy of ISA 247 in renal transplantation was completed in the US and Canada in January 2003. The trial compared ISA 247 with ciclosporin (Neoral in approximately 130 stable renal transplant patients who underwent transplantation at least 6 months prior to enrolment; patient recruitment was completed in October 2002. Half of the patients were treated with ciclosporin and the other half received ISA 247 over a 90-day period. An extension trial was then initiated in which another 200 patients were treated with ISA 247 for up to 6 months from the time of transplantation. Results from the trial were reported. All endpoints were achieved in a multiple ascending dose study of trans-ISA 247 in November 2004. The study, initiated in June 2004, was conducted by SFBC Anapharm in Montreal, Canada and involved 43 healthy volunteers. Final dosing recommendations are to be determined in phase III trials in patients with psoriasis. Interim results reported in September 2004, of a double-blind, parallel-group, placebo and moxifloxacin controlled, randomised single-dose QTc trial in healthy volunteers, showed no evidence of QTc prolongation when trans-ISA 247 was administered at therapeutic doses. A single ascending dose (SAD) trial for trans-ISA 247 was completed in July 2004. The SAD trial was conducted among healthy volunteers to assess the appropriate dosage of trans-ISA 247 for further clinical evaluations. The trial commenced in March 2004 with approximately 46 subjects enrolled under the supervision of MDS Pharma Services in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. Isotechnika received US FDA approval for the SAD trial in February 2004. A European patent (No. EP 0 991 660) entitled 'Deuterated and Undeuterated Cyclosporine Analgoues and Their Use as Immunomodulating Agents' was issued to Isotechnika for ISA 247, in October 2006. A US patent entitled 'Novel Cyclosporin Analogue Formulations' was issued to Isotechnika (No. 7 060 672) for ISA 247 in June 2006. The patent claims have been filed in 36 countries, and in the US it is the first patent to be issued in this patent family. Isotechnika was issued a US patent (No. 6 998 385, entitled 'Cyclosporine Analogue Mixtures and their use as Immunomodulating Agents') in February 2006 covering mixtures of cis- and trans- isomers of ISA 257. This patent is the first US patent to be issued in this family of patents. These patent claims have been filed in 36 countries. Three patents relating to this claim were previously issued in the following countries; Morocco (No. 26337 issued 1 October 2004); Pakistan (No. 138338 issued 30 September 2004) and South Africa (No. 2004/2270 issued 25 May 2005). A US patent (No 6 686 454) was issued in February 2004 entitled 'Antibodies to Specific Regions of Cyclosporine Related Compounds'. This patent covers a novel, simple and cost-effective assay used in the use and management of ISA 247. It also received another US patent entitled 'Deuterated Cyclosporine Analogs and their Use as Immunomodulating Agents'. Isotechnika has received patents for chemical composition of ISA 247 in New Zealand (November 2001; New Zealand Patent No. 502362), Canada (December 2001; Canadian Patent No. 2 298 572), South Korea (June 2006; South Korean Patent No. 585348) and Australia (November 2002; Australian Patent No. 750245). In addition, Isotechnika announced in August 2003 that it had been granted US patent No. 6 605 593, entitled 'Deuterated Ciclosporine Analogs and their use as Immunomodulating Agents'. An additional US patent covering ISA 247 was granted in September 2003. "
"Abstract: Crohn's disease is a chronic relapsing disease for which no complete cure is available. Although drug therapy with agents such as corticosteroids and azathiopurine is useful, the long-term side effects of these drugs are problematic. The advent of infliximab has recently brought a change in treatment, but the long-term side effects of this agent remain uncertain. In contrast, nutritional therapy produces no drug-induced side effects and is effective in inducing and maintaining remission. However, sufficient efficacy cannot be expected in patients in whom compliance with nutritional regimens gradually decreases owing to unpalatability. In these cases, combination therapy with agents such as immunosuppressors and infliximab may be useful. "
"Abstract: Asian Indian dyslipidemia is characterized by: borderline high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein (apo) B; high triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apoA1; and high lipoprotein(a) (lp[a]). We performed a controlled multicentric trial in India to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed dose combination of lovastatin and niacin extended release (niacin(ER)) formulation in patients with moderate to severe dyslipidemia. Consecutive subjects that satisfied the selection criteria, agreed to an informed consent, and with no baseline presence of liver/renal disease or heart failure were enrolled in the study. After a 4-week run-in period there were 142 patients with LDL levels > or = 130 mg/dL. Eleven patients were excluded because of uncontrolled hyperglycemia and 131 patients were recruited. After baseline evaluation of clinical and biochemical parameters all subjects were administered lovastatin (20 mg) and niacin(ER) (500 mg) combination once daily. Dose escalation was done on basis of lipid parameters at 8 weeks and in 11 patients increased to lovastatin (20 mg) and niacin(ER) (1000 mg). An intention-to-treat analysis was performed and data was analyzed using nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test. Thirteen patients (10%) were lost to follow-up and 4 (3%) withdrew because of dermatological adverse effects: flushing, pruritus, and rash. The mean values of various lipid parameters (mg/dL) at baseline, and at weeks 4, 12, and 24 respectively were: total cholesterol 233.9 +/- 27, 206.3 +/- 27, 189.8 +/- 31, and 174.9 +/- 27 mg/dL; LDL cholesterol 153.4 +/- 22, 127.3 +/- 21, 109.2 +/- 27, and 95.1 +/- 23 mg/dL; triglycerides 171.1 +/- 72, 159.5 +/- 75, 149.2 +/- 45, and 135.2 +/- 40 mg/dL; HDL cholesterol 45.6 +/- 7, 48.9 +/- 7, 51.6 +/- 9, and 53.9 +/- 10 mg/dL; lp(a) 48.5 +/- 26, 40.1 +/- 21, 35.4 +/- 21, and 26.9 +/- 19 mg/dL; and apoA1/apoB ratio 0.96 +/- 0.7, 1.04 +/- 0.4, 1.17 +/- 0.5, and 1.45 +/- 0.5 (p < 0.01). The percentage of decline in various lipids at 4, 12, and 24 weeks was: total cholesterol 11.8%, 18.8%, and 25.2%; LDL cholesterol 17.0%, 28.8%, and 38.0%; triglyceride 6.8%, 12.8%, and 21.0%; lp(a) 17.5%, 26.9%, and 44.5% respectively (p < 0.01). HDL cholesterol and apoA1/apoB increased by 7.2%, 13.1%, and 18.2%; and 7.9%, 21.9%, and 51.6% respectively (p < 0.01). Target LDL levels (< 100 mg/dL in subjects with manifest coronary heart disease or diabetes; < 130 mg/dL in subjects with > 2 risk factors) were achieved in 92 (80.7%) patients. No significant changes were observed in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, blood creatinine, transaminases, or creatine kinase. A fixed dose combination of lovastatin and niacin(ER) significantly improved cholesterol lipoprotein lipids as well as lp(a) and apoA1/apoB levels in Asian Indian dyslipidemic patients. Satisfactory safety and tolerability profile in this population was also demonstrated. "
"Abstract: Corticosteroids are currently the first line of treatment for patients with atopic dermatitis. In the pediatric population however, the potential impact of adrenal suppression is always an important safety concern. Twenty boys and girls, 5-12 years of age, with normal adrenal function and a history of atopic dermatitis were maximally treated three times daily with a lipid-rich, moisturizing formulation of hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1% for up to 4 weeks. At the conclusion of the 4-week treatment period, cosyntropin injection stimulation testing showed no evidence of adrenal suppression. In addition, the therapy was noted to be highly efficacious, with a clinical success rate of 80% (Physician Global Score of (0) clear or (1) almost clear). No local side effects associated with prolonged use of topical corticosteroids were reported. In summary, this study supports the contention that this lipid-rich, moisturizing formulation of hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1% was a well-tolerated and beneficial treatment for atopic dermatitis, demonstrating no adrenal suppression in the pediatric population aged 5-12 years. The relevance of these findings for children below 5 years of age, because of difference in body mass/surface area ratios, remains to be determined. "
"Abstract: A new kind of catanionic assembly was developed that associates a sugar-based surfactant with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Three different assemblies using indomethacin, ibuprofen and ketoprofen as NSAIDs were easily obtained in water by an acid-base reaction. These assemblies formed new amphiphilic entities because of electrostatic and hydrophobic effects in water and led to the spontaneous formation of vesicles. These catanionic vesicles were then tested as potential NSAID delivery systems for dermatological application. The anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated in vivo, and this study clearly showed an improved therapeutic effect for NSAIDs that were formulated as catanionic vesicles. These vesicles ensured a slower diffusion of the NSAID through the skin. This release probably increased the time of retention of the NSAID in the targeted strata of the skin. Thus, the present study suggests that this catanionic bioactive formulation could be a promising dermal delivery system for NSAIDs in the course of skin inflammation treatment. "
"Abstract: Ellagic acid (EA) is a potent antioxidant marketed as a nutritional supplement. Its pharmacological activity has been reported in wide variety of disease models; however its use has been limited owing to its poor biopharmaceutical properties, thereby poor bioavailability. The objective of the current study was to develop chitosan-glycerol phosphate (C-GP) in situ gelling system for sustained delivery of ellagic acid (EA) via subcutaneous route. EA was incorporated in the system employing propylene glycol (PG) and triethanolamine (TEA) as co-solvents; on the other hand EA loaded PLGA nanoparticles (np) were dispersed in the gelling system using water. These in situ gelling systems were thoroughly characterized for mechanical, rheological and swelling properties. These systems are liquid at room temperature and gels at 37 degrees C. The EA C-GP system showed an initial burst release in vitro with about 85% drug released in 12 h followed by a steady release till 160 h, on the other hand EA nanoparticles entrapped in the C-GP system displayed sustained release till 360 h. The histopathological analysis indicates the absence of inflammation on administration, suggesting that these formulations are safe during the studied period. Furthermore, the antioxidant potential of EA C-GP and EA np C-GP gels has been evaluated against cyclosporine induced nephrotoxicity in rats. The data indicates that formulations were effective against cyclosporine induced nephrotoxicity, where the EA C-GP gels showed activity at 10 times lower dose and the EA np C-GP gels at 150 times lower dose when compared to orally given EA. Formulating nanoparticles of EA and incorporating them in C-GP system results in 15 times lowering of dose in comparison EA C-GP gels which is quite significant. Together, these results indicate that the bioavailability of ellagic acid can be improved by subcutaneous formulations administered as simple EA or EA nps. "
"Abstract: Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), also called hand-foot syndrome or hand-to-foot syndrome, is a distinctive and relatively frequent dermatologic toxic reaction associated with certain chemotherapeutic agents. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), a long-circulating formulation of doxorubicin in which doxorubicin hydrochloride is encapsulated within pegylated liposomes, is approved to treat patients with metastatic breast cancer, advanced ovarian cancer, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related Kaposi's sarcoma. The incidence of PPE is increased in patients receiving PLD compared with conventional doxorubicin. In studies that utilized the currently approved dose of PLD (50 mg/m(2) every 4 weeks), approximately 50% of all patients receiving PLD experienced PPE, and approximately 20% experienced grade 3 PPE. The pathophysiology of PPE, as it occurs with any drug with which it is associated, is not well understood. Studies evaluating the development of PPE specifically associated with PLD have not fully elucidated the mechanism; however, data support the roles of drug excretion in sweat and local pressure as contributors. When PPE develops, clinical interventions with respect to altering PLD administration include dose reduction, less frequent dosing, and ultimately, drug withdrawal with several consequences on treatment efficacy. This article will review the available data regarding the etiology and potential management strategies of PPE associated with PLD. "
"Abstract: Once-daily tacrolimus extended-release formulation (Prograf XL, formerly referred to as MR or MR4) was compared with the twice-a-day tacrolimus formulation (TAC) and cyclosporine microemulsion (CsA), all administered in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), corticosteroids and basiliximab induction, in a phase 3, randomized (1:1:1), open-label trial in 638 de novo kidney transplant recipients. In combination with MMF and corticosteroids, XL had an efficacy profile comparable to TAC and CsA. XL/MMF and TAC/MMF were statistically noninferior at 1-year posttransplantation to CsA/MMF for the primary efficacy endpoint, efficacy failure (death, graft loss, biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (BCAR) or lost to follow-up). One-year patient and graft survival were 98.6% and 96.7% in the XL/MMF group, 95.7% and 92.9% in TAC/MMF group and 97.6% and 95.7% in CsA/MMF group. The safety profile of XL in comparison with CsA was similar to that observed with TAC in this study and consistent with previously published reports of TAC in comparison with CsA. The results support the safety and efficacy of tacrolimus in combination with MMF, corticosteroids and basiliximab induction, as well as XL as a safe and effective once-daily dosing alternative. "
"PURPOSE: To explore the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of paclitaxel and two major metabolites after three single oral administrations of a novel drinking solution and two capsule formulations in combination with cyclosporin A (CsA) in patients with advanced cancer. Moreover, the tolerability and safety of the formulations was studied. In addition, single nucleotide polymorphisms in the multidrug resistance (MDR1) gene were determined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients were enrolled and randomized to receive CsA 10 mg/kg followed by oral paclitaxel 180 mg given as (1) drinking solution (formulation 1), (2) capsule formulation 2B, and (3) capsule formulation 2C on day 1, 8, or 15. RESULTS: The median C (max) of paclitaxel was 0.42 (0.23-0.96), 0.48 (0.08-0.59), and 0.39 (0.11-1.03) microg/ml and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve was 2.83 (1.69-5.12), 2.01 (1.57-3.04), and 2.67 (1.05-3.61) mug h/ml following administration of formulations 1, 2B, and 2C, respectively. The novel formulations were tolerated after single oral dose without causing relevant gastrointestinal or haematological toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The PK and metabolism of paclitaxel were comparable between the oral formulations co-administered with CsA. "
"OBJECTIVES: To compare the acceptability, tolerability, and safety of 3 topical microbicide formulations (62% ethyl alcohol in emollient gel and 0.1% and 0.4% benzalkonium chloride on a sanitary wipe) for use on male genitalia. DESIGN: This triple-randomized crossover study among men attending a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic in Nairobi, Kenya assigned individuals without clinical evidence of an STD to apply products to the penis in a predetermined random order, each for a 2-week period with a 1-week washout period between each product. Men recorded side effects and were examined for adverse events. RESULTS: Of 39 participants, 33 (84%) completed 6 clinic visits plus 3 home visits by community health workers. Participants reported use of 62% ethanol gel and 0.1% and 0.4% benzalkonium on 99%, 99%, and 96% of daily scheduled applications; 99%, 98%, and 97% of preintercourse applications, and 99%, 94%, and 98% of postintercourse applications. All participants said they would recommend all 3 products to a friend; 72% preferred the 62% ethanol gel, 17% the 0.1% benzalkonium, and 11% the 0.4% benzalkonium. One person developed objective signs of a genital ulcer after 14 days of 0.4% benzalkonium wipe use. CONCLUSIONS: Two of the 3 topical microbicides had minimal reported adverse effects, and no adverse effects were observed during use of the ethanol gel, which was preferred by most men. "
"BACKGROUND: Alpha-hydroxy acids such as glycolic acid (GA) and lactic acid (LA), are used in cosmetic patches. The important fact in cosmetic patches is its suitable adhesion and peel properties. AIM: The objective of this study was to prepare LA- and GA-containing cosmetic patches and evaluate in-vitro/in-vivo correlation of adhesion properties. METHODS: Pressure-sensitive adhesives with different concentrations of GA and LA were cast on a polyethylene terephthalate film. The patches were evaluated for peel adhesive strength. On the basis of in vitro adhesion properties the patches were selected for wear performance tests and skin irritation potential. RESULTS: The adhesion properties (adhesion to steel plate and skin) and cohesive strength tests indicated the substantial influence of GA and LA concentrations. Based on in vitro adhesion studies the patches containing 3% (w/w) GA were selected for in vivo studies. In vivo studies show that a formulation containing 3% GA displays good adhesion on the skin, but it leaves little residues on the skin. Skin Irritation studies on healthy human volunteers showed negligible erythema at the site of application after 48 h. CONCLUSION: The noninvasive patch test model was found useful for detecting irritant skin reactions to the cosmetic patch containing GA. Our results demonstrated a strong correlation between the adhesion to steel plate and adhesion to skin. But a weak correlation between the degree of adhesive residue on the skin in in vitro and in vivo tests was observed for the formulation containing 3% (w/w) GA. "

"Abstract: Cutting fluids are widely used in the metal-machining industry to lubricate and reduce heat generation when metals are cut by a metal-cutting tool. These cutting fluids have caused occupational irritant contact dermatitis (OICD), and many of the additives used in these cutting fluid mixtures are thought to be responsible for OICD in workers. The purpose of this study was to assess single or various combinations of these additives in initiating the OICD response following an acute 8-hour exposure in porcine skin in vivo and in vitro using the isolated perfused porcine skin flap (IPPSF) and human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK). Pigs (n = 4) were exposed to 5% mineral oil (MO) or 5% polyethylene glycol (PEG) aqueous mixtures containing various combinations of 2% triazine (TRI), 5% triethanolamine (TEA), 5% linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), or 5% sulfurized ricinoleic acid (SRA). Erythema and edema were evaluated and skin biopsies for histopathology were obtained at 4 and 8 hours. IPPSFs (n = 4) were exposed to control MO or PEG mixtures and complete MO or PEG mixtures, and perfusate samples were collected hourly to determine interleukin- (IL-) 8 release. The only significant (p < 0.05) mixture effects observed in IPPSFs were with SRA + MO that caused an increase in IL-8 release after 1 or 2 hours' exposure. In vivo exposure to TRI alone appeared to increase erythema, edema, and dermal inflammation compared to the other additives, while SRA alone was least likely to initiate a dermal inflammatory response. In 2-component mixture exposures, the presence of TRI appeared to increase the dermal inflammatory response at 4 and 8 hours especially with the PEG mixtures. In the 3- and 4-component mixtures, MO mixtures are more likely to incite an inflammatory response than PEG mixtures. TRI exhibited the highest toxicity toward HEK, which correlates well to the in vivo irritation and morphology results. In summary, these preliminary studies suggest that the biocide, TRI, is the more potent of the 4 performance additives in causing dermal irritation, and this may vary depending on whether the worker is exposed to a synthetic (PEG)- or MO-based fluid. These findings will however require further clinical studies to validate these acute dermal effects as well as human cumulative irritation following exposure to similar cutting fluid formulations in the workplace.

"Abstract: The formulation of sunscreens products requires information about the properties of the substances responsible for the sun protection, their action mechanisms and the vehicles used for their administration. The improvement of the performance of sunscreen substances by a modification of their chemical, physical and technological properties or by the use of conventional and novel carriers is described in this review. The sun protection achieved by the use of sunscreens incorporated into carriers in terms of the sun protection factor (SPF) and other performance indices is also shown. Current manufacturing methods to incorporate sunscreen substances into vehicles are briefly described. Furthermore, basic information related to the dermatological effects of the UV radiation classified according to the different spectral regions of the UV radiation is presented in this manuscript. "
"Abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an active metabolite of retinal, incorporated in cationic liposomes composed of 1,2 dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP)/cholesterol could inhibit established metastatic lung tumors by delivery to the pulmonary tumor site after intravenous injection. After intravenous injection in mice, the highest lung accumulation of [(3)H]ATRA was observed by the DOTAP/cholesterol liposomes formulation, while other formulations including [(3)H]ATRA dissolved in serum or [(3)H]ATRA incorporated in distearoyl-l-phosphatidylcholine (DSPC)/cholesterol liposomes produced little accumulation in the lung. In mice used as a model of lung cancer metastasis, ATRA incorporated in DOTAP/cholesterol liposomes, injected intravenously, reduced the number of tumor nodules compared with free ATRA or ATRA incorporated in DSPC/cholesterol liposomes. These results suggest that ATRA incorporated in cationic liposomes would be an effective strategy for differentiation therapy of lung cancer metastasis. "
"Abstract: Psoralens are widely used for the treatment of hyperproliferative skin disease. In this work, we prepared nanoparticles (NP) containing a benzopsoralen (3-ethoxy carbonyl-2H-benzofuro[3,2-f]-1-benzopiran-2-one) by the solvent evaporation technique. We evaluated important NP parameters such as particle size, drug encapsulation efficiency, effect of the encapsulation process over the drug's photochemistry, zeta potential, external morphology, and in vitro release behavior. We also investigated the nanoparticle as a drug delivery system (DDS), as well as its target delivery to the action site, which is a very important parameter to increase the therapeutic use of psoralens and to reduce their side effects. The uptake of benzopsoralen-loaded PLGA nanoparticles by different kinds of cells found in rat peritoneal exudates was also studied. The photodamage promoted by irradiation with UV light revealed morphological characteristics of cell damage such as cytoplasmic vesiculation, mitochondrial damage, and swelling of both the granular endoplasmatic reticulum and nuclear membrane. This encapsulation method maintained the drug's properties and improved drug delivery to the target cell. "
"Abstract: Meso-tetraphenyl porphine (mTPP) is a highly lipophilic, fluorescent porphyrin derivate and it is used as photosensitizer on the treatment of malign neoplasms. The aim of this study was to prepare mTPP loaded pluronic F127 and polyethylene glycol-distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG(2000)-DSPE) micelles to evaluate polymeric micelles potential for the transport of drugs through intestinal mucosa. Transport and bioadhesion behaviors of polymeric micelles was investigated using Caco-2 cell monolayer and everted rat intestine models. In order to show that Caco-2 cells can be used as a transport model cytotoxicity of formulations was tested. Cell viability was more than 80%, showing that Caco-2 cells will keep their viability during the transport studies demonstrating that prepared formulations can be securely used as oral drug carrier systems. Plain micelles were labeled with a fluorescent agent rhodamine-phosphatidylethanolamine (Rh-PE) and their transport through Caco-2 cells was investigated beside mTPP loaded micelles. At the end of 4h transport study through Caco-2 cells, cumulative transport (%) of fluorescent agents were around 14% and 1% in Rh-PE labeled and mTPP loaded micelles This difference was attributed to the different placement of mTPP and Rh-PE in the micellar core. Drug transport was not estimated in everted rat intestine model but the bioadhesion was 79% and 70% for mTPP loaded pluronic F127 and PEG(2000)-DSPE micelles. These good bioadhesion rates are promising for oral drug delivery. "
"Abstract: This article presents a practical approach for safe oral sedation in the dental practice. When used properly, oral sedation can provide comfort and a calming treatment environment for patients whose fear inhibits them from securing needed dental care. In Part I, the authors provided information on medico-legal aspects of sedation, patient treatment recommendations, counseling, evaluation, monitoring, documentation, and proper discharge procedures. In this part, the reliable sedatives that have undergone years of clinical trials and have good records of safety and predictable results are presented. For each sedative, the description, formulation and dosage, onset, duration of sedation, and side effects are discussed. "
"Abstract: A systematic investigation of two well-known and popular commercial suncreams reveals significant degradation when exposed to simulated UV sunlight at an irradiance corresponding to natural sunlight. We have examined the photochemistry of two widely used sunscreen active agents in pure solvents separately and together (in solution), and in neat form, as well as their photochemistry when present in the actual suncream emulsion (as thin films on a glass substrate) since their combination typically produces suncreams with high sun protection factors (SPF): (1a) octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC; octinoxate) and (2a) 4-tert-butyl-4'-methoxydibenzoylmethane (also known as avobenzone and Parsol 1789), present in the two suncream formulations in combination with others (one also contained TiO2). Intermediates and/or photoproducts were identified by UV/visible spectroscopy, HPLC and liquid chromatographic/mass spectral methods, and by both 1H and 13C-NMR techniques. Structural assignments of the substrates produced were aided by examining model systems {viz. ethyl cinnamate (1b) and dibenzoylmethane (2b)} of the two sunscreen active agents. Irradiation of the cinnamates and the diketones together led to a [2 + 2] photocycloaddition process yielding cinnamate dimers and cyclobutylketone photoadducts that subsequently fragmented into substituted oxopentanoates and oxobutanoates. Similar findings were observed when the two active agents were simultaneously present in the same suncream emulsion. "
"Abstract: In clinical trials, transdermal oxybutynin (OXY-TDS) has shown comparable efficacy and improved tolerability when compared with conventional pharmacotherapy. Systemic anticholinergic adverse effects are comparable to those with placebo, most likely owing to avoidance of first-pass hepatic metabolism and conversion of oxybutynin to N-desethyloxybutynin. OXY-TDS has predictable pharmacokinetic absorption and elimination parameters, as shown in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Consistent plasma concentrations of oxybutynin avoid labile peak and trough concentrations seen with immediate-release formulations, paralleling extended-release drug delivery. This novel drug delivery system has unique dermatologic skin application site reactions, including erythema and pruritus. Skin reactions are usually mild and can be minimized by varying the site of patch application. Most eczematous dermatologic reactions can be appropriately treated with a moderately potent topical corticosteroid cream. A small percentage of patients will discontinue therapy as a result of bothersome application site skin reactions. "
"Abstract: The number of UV-induced (20 mJ cm(-2)) reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in nucleated epidermis is dependent upon the length of time the UV filter octocrylene, octylmethoxycinnamate, or benzophenone-3 remains on the skin surface. Two-photon fluorescence images acquired immediately after application of each formulation (2 mg cm(-2)) to the skin surface show that the number of ROS produced is dramatically reduced relative to the skin-UV filter control. After each UV filter remains on the skin surface for t=20 min, the number of ROS generated increases, although it remains below the number generated in the control. By t=60 min, the filters generate ROS above the control. The data show that when all three of the UV filters penetrate into the nucleated layers, the level of ROS increases above that produced naturally by epidermal chromophores under UV illumination. "
"AIMS: Many studies report the use of alcoholic capsaicin instillation to treat neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in spinal cord injured (SCI) and multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. However, poor tolerability due to the irritative effect of the ethanol solvent limits its use. Our study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a new formulation of capsaicin in a glucidic solution in a multicenter clinical trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-three patients (26MS/7SCI) suffering from urinary incontinence due to refractory NDO were prospectively enrolled in a double-blind placebo controlled study and randomized to capsaicin group (CG, N = 17) or solvent group (SG, N = 16). They respectively received an intravesical instillation of 100 ml capsaicin diluted in glucidic solvent (CG) or glucidic solvent alone (SG). Efficacy (voiding chart, maximum cystometric capacity (MCC)) and tolerability were evaluated on days 0 (D0), 30 and 90. RESULTS: On D0, groups were homogeneous. On D30, significant improvement of overactive bladder syndrome and an increase in MCC were shown in CG, whereas there were no improvement in SG. No significant improvement was shown on D90 in both groups. There were no significant differences between groups regarding prevalence, duration, or intensity of side effects, except for short duration pubic pain during instillation more often reported in CG (58.8%) than in SG (12.5%) (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: This placebo controlled study using glucidic capsaicin confirms its short-term efficacy in NDO patients. Global tolerance of glucidic capsaicin appeared satisfactory. Long-term efficacy and tolerance of repeated glucidic capsaicin instillations need to be evaluated. "
"Abstract: This study was designed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of MAS065D (Xclair) compared to a vehicle control in the management of radiation dermatitis in patients receiving radiotherapy for breast cancer. Twenty patients were randomized blindly to use the two study substances, three times daily, on separate sections of irradiated skin throughout the duration of radiotherapy and for two weeks afterwards. Patients were monitored before therapy, weekly during therapy, and for 2 weeks after radiotherapy was completed. Skin appearance according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) toxicity criteria, erythema rating, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin hydration, patients' view of itch, pain, acceptance, and view of each cream and adverse events, were monitored; at the final visit patients and investigators expressed their preference for one of the creams. MAS065D showed statistically significant superiority in the outcomes of NCI grading for radiation dermatitis and erythema. Patients' and investigators' preferences for one of the study substances were statistically in favor of MAS065D. Very few patients recorded nonzero itch and pain scales, so no significant differences emerged between the two groups. It was concluded that MAS065D can provide an effective option for managing radiation dermatitis although further studies are needed to assess its effect on pain and itch. "
"INTRODUCTION: The effect of a fluoridated antiplaque dentifrice on the development of caries lesions adjacent to dental appliances bonded with ionomeric material is unknown. METHODS: Fourteen orthodontic patients were randomly divided into 2 groups of 7. One group brushed 3 times a day with a fluoridated dentifrice, and the other used an experimental antiplaque fluoridated formulation. Bracket bases were randomly bonded with either resin-modified glass ionomer cement or composite resin to the buccal surfaces of either the maxillary left or right premolars in each subject. The teeth were banded, leaving a space on the buccal surface to allow dental plaque accumulation. After 28 days of dentifrice use, the teeth were extracted, and mineral loss in the enamel adjacent to the bonded material was assessed by cross-sectional microhardness. RESULTS: Mineral loss in the enamel surrounding the bond with the resin-modified glass ionomer cement was lower (P <.05) than around the composite bond. Enamel demineralization was lower (P <.05) in subjects who used the experimental antiplaque fluoridated formulation than in those who used the fluoridated one. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that an antiplaque fluoridated dentifrice is superior to one that is only fluoridated for reducing enamel demineralization adjacent to dental material bonded with composite, but the effect seems irrelevant when bonding is done with the ionomeric material.

"Abstract: This paper describes the in vitro photoprotection in the UV-A range, i.e. 320-400 nm obtained by the use of carnauba wax-decyl oleate nanoparticles either as encapsulation systems or as accompanying vehicles for inorganic sunscreens such as barium sulfate, strontium carbonate and titanium dioxide. Lipid-free inorganic sunscreen nanosuspensions, inorganic sunscreen-free wax-oil nanoparticle suspensions and wax-oil nanoparticle suspensions containing inorganic sunscreens dispersed either in their oil phase or their aqueous phase were prepared by high pressure homogenization. The in vitro erythemal UV-A protection factors (EUV-A PFs) of the nanosuspensions were calculated by means of a sun protection analyzer. EUV-A PFs being no higher than 4 were obtained by the encapsulation of barium sulfate and strontium carbonate, meanwhile by the distribution of titanium dioxide in presence of wax-oil nanoparticles, the EUV-A PFs varied between 2 and 19. The increase in the EUV-A PFs of the titanium dioxide obtained by the use of wax-oil nanoparticles demonstrated a better performance of the sun protection properties of this pigment in the UV-A region.

"Abstract: Aspirin has become the gold standard to which newer antiplatelet drugs are compared for reducing risks of cardiovascular diseases, while keeping low cost. Oral aspirin has a repertoire of gastrointestinal side effects even at low doses and requires high frequent dosing because it undergoes extensive presystemic metabolism. Transdermal delivery offers an alternative route that bypasses the gut and may be more convenient and safer for aspirin delivery especially during long-term use. This study comprised formulation of aspirin in different topical bases. Release studies revealed that hydrocarbon gel allowed highest drug release. In vitro permeation studies revealed high drug permeation from hydrocarbon gel. Several chemical penetration enhancers were monitored for augmenting the permeation from this base. Combination of propylene glycol and alcohol showed maximum enhancing effect and, hence, was selected for biological investigation. The biological performance of the selected formulation was assessed by measuring the inhibition of platelet aggregation relevant to different dosage regimens aiming to minimize both drug dose and frequency of application. The results demonstrated the feasibility of successfully influencing platelet function and revealed that the drug therapeutic efficacy in transdermal delivery system is dose independent. Biological performance was re-assessed after storage and the results revealed stability and persistent therapeutic efficacy. "
"Abstract: To explore the parmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of paclitaxel after oral administration of SMEOF#3, a novel Self-Microemulsifying Oily Formulation, in combination with cyclosporin A (CsA) in patients with advanced cancer. Seven patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive oral paclitaxel (SMEOF#3) 160 mg+CsA 700 mg on day 1, followed by oral paclitaxel (Taxol) 160 mg+CsA 700 mg on day 8 (group I) or vice versa (group II). Patients received paclitaxel (Taxol) 160 mg as 3-h infusion on day 15. The median (range) area under the plasma concentration-time curve of paclitaxel was 2.06 (1.15-3.47) microg h ml(-1) and 1.97 (0.58-3.22) microg h ml(-1) after oral administration of SMEOF#3 and Taxol, respectively, and 4.69 (3.90-6.09) microg h ml(-1) after intravenous Taxol. Oral SMEOF#3 resulted in a lower median T(max) of 2.0 (0.5-2.0) h than orally applied Taxol (T(max)=4.0 (0.8-6.1) h, P=0.02). The median apparent bioavailability of paclitaxel was 40 (19-83)% and 55 (9-70)% for the oral SMEOF#3 and oral Taxol formulation, respectively. Oral paclitaxel administered as SMEOF#3 or Taxol was safe and well tolerated by the patients. Remarkably, the SMEOF#3 formulation resulted in a significantly lower T(max) than orally applied Taxol, probably due to the excipients in the SMEOF#3 formulation resulting in a higher absorption rate of paclitaxel.

"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of topical 20% azelaic acid cream and 15% azelaic acid gel compared with their respective vehicles and metronidazole gel in the treatment of papulopustular rosacea. DATA SOURCES: Electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and SciSearch through July or August 2004 and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through 2004 (issue 3). We performed hand searches of reference lists, conference proceedings, and clinical trial databases. Experts in rosacea and azelaic acid were contacted. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials involving topical azelaic acid (cream or gel) for the treatment of rosacea compared with placebo or other topical treatments. Two authors independently examined the studies identified by the searches. Ten studies were identified, of which 5 were included (873 patients). DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently extracted data from the included studies, then jointly assessed methodological quality using a quality assessment scale. DATA SYNTHESIS: Because standard deviation data were not available for 4 of the 5 studies, a meta-analysis could not be conducted. Four of the 5 studies demonstrated significant decreases in mean inflammatory lesion count and erythema severity after treatment with azelaic acid compared with vehicle. None of the studies showed any significant decrease in telangiectasia severity. CONCLUSIONS: Azelaic acid in 20% cream and 15% gel formulations appears to be effective in the treatment of papulopustular rosacea, particularly in regard to decreases in mean inflammatory lesion count and erythema severity. Compared with metronidazole, azelaic acid appears to be an equally effective, if not better, treatment option. "
"OBJECTIVE: To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of a novel, long-acting sufentanil preparation in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy (OHE). STUDY DESIGN: Blinded, positively controlled, randomized field trial with four parallel treatment groups. ANIMALS: Eighty client owned dogs undergoing elective OHE randomly allocated into four treatment groups (each n = 20). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three groups received intramuscular (IM) sufentanil (at 10, 15 and 25 microg kg(-1), respectively) and the control group received subcutaneous (SC) carprofen 4 mg kg(-1) SC plus acepromazine 0.05 mg kg(-1) IM as pre-anaesthetic medication. OHE was performed under thiopental/halothane anaesthesia. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores for pain and sedation were awarded and mechanical nociceptive thresholds were measured at the wound and hock before surgery and up to 24 hours after tracheal extubation. Serum cortisol was measured before surgery, during surgery and up to 24 hours after tracheal extubation. Animals with inadequate post-operative analgesia were given rescue medication. RESULTS: In the carprofen group, VAS pain scores were significantly higher, wound tenderness was greater and requirement for rescue analgesia was more than in the sufentanil-treated groups. Sufentanil produced dose dependent analgesia and sedation. All treatment groups showed similar patterns of change for cortisol concentrations. Use of the sufentanil preparation was associated with a relatively high incidence of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The long-acting preparation of sufentanil provided excellent post-operative analgesia that was significantly better than that provided by carprofen. However, use of this formulation, in the anaesthetic technique used in the study, resulted in a relatively high incidence of adverse effects. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Full mu (MOP) opioid agonists provide significantly better post-operative analgesia than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs after moderately painful surgery. However, the widely recognized adverse effects of opioids may preclude the use of these agents. "
"Abstract: 6-O-Ascorbic acid alkanoates (ASCn) are amphiphilic molecules having physical-chemical properties that depend on the alkyl chain length. The derivatives of low molecular weight (n < 11) have enough aqueous solubility to produce self-assemblies at room temperature ( approximately 25 degrees C), while those with longer alkyl chains possess a critical micellar temperature (CMT) higher than 30 degrees C. At higher temperatures (T degrees > CMT), ASCn aqueous suspensions turn into either micellar solutions or gel phases, depending on the length of the hydrophobic chain. On cooling, coagels are produced, which possess a lamellar structure that exhibit sharp X-ray diffraction patterns and optical birefringence. The semisolid consistency of such coagels is an interesting property to formulate dermatological pharmaceutical dosage forms able to solubilize and stabilize different drugs. The objective of the present study was the evaluation of the enhancing permeation effect of ASCn with different chain lengths and to correlate permeability changes with histological effects. With this purpose, ASCn coagels containing anthralin (antipsoriasic drug) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC, hydrophobic fluorescent marker) were assayed on rat skin (ex vivo) and mice skin (in vivo), respectively. Also, histological studies were performed aimed at detecting some possible side effects of ASCn. No inflammatory cellular response was observed in the skin when ASCn coagels were applied, suggesting non-irritating properties. Light microscopy indicated slight disruption and fragmentation of stratum corneum. The penetration of ASCn through rat skin epidermis was very fast and quantitatively significant. The permeation of anthralin was significantly increased when the drug was vehiculized in ASCn coagels, compared to other pharmaceutical systems. The results indicated that ASC12 seems to have the highest enhancing effect on FITC permeation. ASC12 appears to be the compound that possesses the highest capacity to enhance the penetration of the drugs. Furthermore, it has the highest permeation of the serie. "
"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this experimental gingivitis study was to assess the efficacy and safety of two new chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthrinses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety volunteers participated in this investigator-blind, randomized, clinical-controlled trial in parallel groups. During the treatment period, no oral hygiene measures except rinsing with non-alcoholic 0.2% CHX or 0.2% CHX/0.055% sodium fluoride mouthrinses, a positive control, or a negative control were permitted. The primary parameter was the gingival index; the secondary parameters were plaque index, discolouration index, and bleeding on probing. Clinical examinations were conducted 14 days before the start of the study, at baseline, and after 7, 14, and 21 days. The two sample t-test, anova, and ancova were used for the statistical analysis. RESULTS: No difference in efficacy was found between the two new CHX formulations and the positive control. On day 21, statistically significantly less gingival inflammation and plaque accumulation compared with placebo were observed. Besides discolouration and taste irritations, no adverse events were recorded. CONCLUSION: The two new CHX mouthrinses were able to inhibit plaque re-growth and gingivitis. Neither the omission of alcohol nor the supplementation with sodium fluoride had weakened the clinical efficacy of CHX with respect to the analysed clinical parameters. "
"Abstract: Since the introduction of generic oral isotretinoin there have been discussions around harmonizing the summary of product characteristics of each formulation. As a result of these discussions, a European Directive concerned with the prescribing of oral isotretinoin has been introduced and the FDA (Food and Drugs Administration) has recently implemented new regulations. The aims of this article are to summarize the history of the processes involved, outline the new recommendations and discuss the impact of these changes in clinical practice. "
"BACKGROUND: More effective strategies are required for the prevention of skin cancer, which is caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation in sunlight. Sunscreens containing UV filters or reflectors offer some protection from sunlight. Pharmacologically active compounds that reduce UV damage offer considerable potential for improving sunscreen formulations. However, few studies have investigated whether the addition of such biological modifiers are an improvement. OBJECTIVES: In this study we supplemented a 2-ethyl hexyl methoxycinnamate-based sunscreen with the nitric oxide (NO) inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine acetate, the iron chelator 2,2'-dipyridyl, which reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, or both. This was to determine whether inhibition of NO, ROS, or both could improve photoprotection by a sunscreen. METHODS: These sunscreens were compared for photoprotection from sunburn, immunosuppression and skin carcinogenesis in mice. To observe additional photoprotection by the NO and ROS inhibitors, UV doses were used that exceeded the protective capacity of the sunscreen. RESULTS: The combined inhibition of both NO and ROS production, but neither alone, increased sunscreen protection from sunburn and immunosuppression. Similarly, inhibition of both NO and ROS but neither alone reduced tumour multiplicity and incidence, therefore improving sunscreen protection from photocarcinogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Whether NO and ROS inhibition were independently improving sunscreen photoprotection, with both being required for an observable effect, or whether inhibition of an interaction between NO and ROS was responsible for improved photoprotection by the sunscreen is unknown. These studies show that supplementation of a sunscreen with inhibitors of NO and ROS production improves the ability of the sunscreen to protect from sunburn, immunosuppression and photocarcinogenesis. Such an approach may be useful for reducing skin cancer incidence in humans. "
"Abstract: The objective of our present study was to prepare and evaluate gelatin microspheres of oxybenzone to enhance its sunscreening efficacy. The gelatin microspheres of oxybenzone were prepared by emulsion method. Process parameters were analyzed to optimize the formulation. The in vitro drug release study was performed in pH 7.4 using cellulose acetate membrane. Microspheres prepared using oxybenzone:gelatin ratio of 1:6 showed slowest drug release and those prepared with oxybenzone:gelatin ratio of 1:2 showed fastest drug release. The gelatin microspheres of oxybenzone were incorporated in aloe vera gel. Sun exposure method using sodium nitroprusside solution was used for in vitro sunscreen efficacy testing. The formulation C5 containing oxybenzone-bearing gelatin microspheres in aloe vera gel showed best sunscreen efficacy. The formulations were evaluated for skin irritation test in human volunteers, sun protection factor, and minimum erythema dose in albino rats. These studies revealed that the incorporation of sunscreening agent-loaded microspheres into aloe vera gel greatly increased the efficacy of sunscreen formulation more than four times. "
"Abstract: Pharmaceutical grade D,L-lactic acid, which is rather an economic source in comparison to lactide monomer, was utilized for synthesis of a series of copolymers with sebacic acid. Polymers were characterized by GPC, FTIR, NMR and DSC techniques, and formulated into blank and methotrexate (MTX) loaded microspheres by emulsion-solvent evaporation method. In vitro degradation of blank microspheres was studied by FTIR, GPC and SEM analysis. MTX loaded microspheres showed the encapsulation efficiency of 44-64% and were in the size range of 40-60 microm. These were used to study the release profile of the encapsulated drug. The release was found to be affected by the pH and buffer concentration of the release medium which was in turn revealed by solubility studies of MTX. The overall study demonstrates significance of drug as well as polymer properties on release. Biocompatibility of polymer was evaluated by injecting microspheres subcutaneously into Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat and no local histopathological abnormalities were found. "
"Abstract: Though used occasionally, systemic therapies in severe childhood psoriasis have not been systematically investigated. Cyclosporin A (CysA) is effective in adults with severe psoriasis but there are no extensive data regarding the efficacy and safety of its use in childhood psoriasis. In this paper, we describe six children aged between 11 months and 13 years (average: 7.6 years) treated with CysA microemulsion formulation for severe psoriasis, who had been unresponsive to other treatments. The CysA dose ranged from 2 to 4 mg/kg/day, for periods varying from 8 to 105 weeks (mean: 54 weeks). Dose tapering was gradual after lesion improvement and adjusted according to clinical response. Adjuvant therapy with topical steroids, vitamin D3 ointments, coal tar preparations or anthralin was used in all children. Acitretin was used in three patients for short periods. The children were regularly monitored for serum renal and liver function and blood pressure. Improvement of skin lesions was achieved after between 4 and 30 (mean: 12) weeks of treatment, with complete remission in three children. Relapse of lesions occurred in the other children during CysA reduction, but they responded to a dose increase. The treatment was found to be well tolerated and with no significant side-effects. CysA can be used in carefully selected and monitored patients and may represent an alternative tool for severe episodes of psoriasis in children, when other therapies are unsuccessful. "
"Abstract: Water in oil emulsions represents one of the new promising generations of adjuvants for immunotherapy. Fifty years ago, incomplete freund adjuvant (IFA) has been used in clinical trials for prophylactic vaccines like poliomyelitis or flu vaccine because of its strong potency. However, even if the quality of the raw materials has been improved in order to avoid secondary reactions, the risk benefit ratio was not favorable to its use for prophylactic vaccines. Moreover, emulsions were highly viscous with a weak stability. The development of new adjuvants concepts like liposomes, oil in water emulsions, bacterial immunostimulating compounds has induced a loss of interest for such formulations. The emergence of immunotherapy treatments for cancer, AIDS or other diseases leads to the re-emergence of these adjuvants, as the risk benefit ratio is more favorable. Then, safety of these adjuvants has been improved by the use of more specific surfactants and refined oils but also by improving their manufacturing process, allowing even sometimes their use in clinical trials for prophylactic vaccines. "
"Abstract: The toxicokinetics of 4-MBC after dermal administration were investigated in human subjects and in rats. Humans (3 male and 3 female subjects) were exposed to 4-MBC by topical application of a commercial sunscreen formulation containing 4% 4-MBC (w/w), covering 90% of the body surface and resulting in a mean dermal 4-MBC dose of 22 mg/kg bw. In rats, dermal 4-MBC doses of 400 and 2000 mg/kg bw were applied in a formulation using an occlusive patch for 24 h. Concentrations of 4-MBC and its metabolites were monitored over 96 h in plasma (rats and humans) and urine (humans). In human subjects, plasma levels of 4-MBC peaked at 200 pmol/ml in males and 100 pmol/ml in females 6 h after application and then decreased to reach the limit of detection after 24 h (females), respectively, 36 h (males). After dermal application of 4-MBC, peak plasma concentrations of 3-(4-carboxybenzylidene)-6-hydroxycamphor were 50-80 pmol/ml at 12 h and of 3-(4-carboxybenzylidene)camphor were 100-200 pmol/ml at 24 h. In male and female rats, peak plasma levels of 4-MBC were 200 (dose of 400 mg/kg bw) and 1 200 pmol/ml (dose of 2000 mg/kg bw). These levels remained constant for up to 24-48 h after dermal application. Peak plasma concentrations of 3-(4-carboxybenzylidene)-6-hydroxycamphor were 18,000 pmol/ml (males) and of 3-(4-carboxybenzylidene)camphor were 55,000 pmol/ml (females) between 48 and 72 h after application of the high dose of 4-MBC. In human subjects, only a small percentage of the dermally applied dose of 4-MBC was recovered in the form of metabolites in urine, partly as glucuronides. The obtained results suggest a more intensive biotransformation of 4-MBC in rats as compared to humans after dermal application and a poor absorption of 4-MBC through human skin. "
"Abstract: Inhaled mometasone furoate (Asmanex) is a synthetic corticosteroid indicated for the first-line maintenance prophylactic therapy of persistent asthma in adults and adolescents. It is formulated for delivery via a breath-actuated dry powder inhaler (DPI) [Twisthaler].Inhaled mometasone furoate delivered by DPI is effective in treating patients with persistent asthma. It improves pulmonary function and health-related quality of life, reduces symptoms and decreases oral corticosteroid requirements in severe disease. It is a potent anti-inflammatory agent and is at least as clinically effective as other inhaled corticosteroids. Inhaled mometasone furoate is equally effective in controlling asthma when administered in two divided doses or as a single daily dose. Once-daily administration of mometasone furoate 200 microg in the evening was more effective than administration of the same dosage in the morning. The drug is well tolerated, with low systemic bioavailability and minimal systemic activity. Therefore, it is an effective and convenient option for controller therapy of persistent asthma in adults and adolescents. "
"Abstract: Commercial formulations of the codling moth, Cydia pomonella L., granulovirus (CpGV) are limited by their short residual activity under orchard conditions in the Pacific Northwest. We evaluated spray-dried lignin-encapsulated formulations of CpGV for improved solar stability based on laboratory bioassays with a solar simulator and in field tests in an infested apple orchard. In laboratory tests, aqueous lignin formulations containing a high dosage of 3 x 10(10) occlusion bodies (OB)/L, with and without the additives titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) and sugar, provided significant solar protection of virus, i.e., mortality of codling moth exposed to lignin formulations that had been irradiated with 9.36 x 10(6) joules/m(2) was 92-94%, compared with 66-67% from a glycerin-stabilized product (Cyd-X) or suspension of pure unformulated virus at the same rates. By comparison, a lower dosage of the lignin formulation (3 x 10(8)OB/L) did not provide significant solar protection. Equivalent dosage-dependent patterns in solar protection were observed in further tests with the lignin formulation, when an intermediate (3 x 10(9)OB/L) as well as the low dosage provided no solar protection. Equivalent rates of a blank lignin formulation (containing no virus) did not affect larval mortality, suggesting a protective effect of the lignin on the virus at the high rate. The use of several spray adjuvants, 'NuFilm-17' and 'Organic Biolink' (sticker-spreaders at 0.06% v/v), 'Raynox' (sunburn protectant at 5% v/v), and 'Trilogy'(neem oil at 1% v/v) did not provide solar protection of a commercial CpGV preparation in laboratory tests. In season long orchard tests (Golden Delicious), the lignin formulation of CpGV applied at 6.57 x 10(12)OB/ha did not significantly improve control of codling moth or protection of fruit compared with Cyd-X at equivalent rates. Our studies show that lignin-based CpGV formulations provided solar protection at relatively high virus dosages. The testing of lignin formulations containing reduced virus concentrations may allow virus solar protection to be achieved at more economical rates. "
"GOALS OF WORK: To develop a practice guideline report on the questions: What are the optimal methods to prevent acute skin reactions (occurring within the first 6 months of irradiation) related to radiation therapy? What are the optimal methods to manage acute skin reactions related to radiation therapy? MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cancer Care Ontario's Supportive Care Guidelines Group (SCGG) conducted a systematic review of literature on this topic. Evidence-based recommendations were formulated to guide clinical decision making, and a formal external review process was conducted to validate the relevance of these opinions for Ontario practitioners. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-eight trials meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. Of the twenty-three trials that evaluated preventative methods, washing was the only practice which significantly prevented skin reaction. Some evidence suggested topical steroid creams and calendula ointment might be effective. None of the five trials evaluating skin reaction management detected a positive effect using steroid cream, sucralfate cream, or dressings. CONCLUSIONS: Skin washing, including gentle washing with water alone with or without mild soap, should be permitted in patients receiving radiation therapy to prevent acute skin reaction. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute specific topical or oral agents for the prevention or management of acute skin reaction. In the expert opinion from the SCGG, the use of a plain, non-scented, lanolin-free hydrophilic cream may be helpful in preventing radiation skin reactions. In addition, a low dose (i.e., 1%) corticosteroid cream may be beneficial in the reduction of itching and irritation. "
"UNLABELLED: Benzophenone is used as a photoinitiator, a fragrance enhancer, an ultraviolet curing agent, and occasionally as a flavor ingredient; it is also used in the manufacture of insecticides, agricultural chemicals, and hypnotics, antihistamines, and other pharmaceuticals; and it is used as an additive in plastics, coatings, and adhesive formulations. Benzophenone was nominated for study by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences based on its potential for occupational and consumer exposure and the lack of long-term toxicity data. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to benzophenone (greater than 99% pure) in feed for 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, mouse bone marrow cells, and mouse peripheral blood erythrocytes. Results of 14-week toxicity studies in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were reported earlier (NTP, 2000). 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were fed diets containing 0, 312, 625, or 1,250 ppm benzophenone (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 15, 30, and 60 mg benzophenone/kg body weight to males and 15, 30, and 65 mg/kg to females) for 105 weeks. Survival of 1,250 ppm males was significantly less than that of controls. Mean body weights of 1,250 ppm males were markedly less than those of the controls during year 2 of the study, and weights of exposed females were consistently less than controls throughout the study. Feed consumption by 1,250 ppm males was less than that by the controls after week 70; feed consumption by 1,250 ppm females was generally less than that by the controls throughout the study. There was a positive trend in the incidences of renal tubule adenoma in males, and the incidences in 625 and 1,250 ppm males exceeded the historical control range for all routes; these neoplasms were accompanied by significantly increased incidences of renal tubule hyperplasia. Due to these findings, additional kidney sections were evaluated; results indicated additional renal tubule adenomas in all groups of males and renal tubule hyperplasia in all groups of males and females. The incidences of pelvic transitional epithelium hyperplasia and the severity of nephropathy were significantly increased in all exposed groups of male rats. Increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in all exposed groups of females exceeded the historical control range from feed studies, and the incidence in 625 ppm females was significantly greater than that in the controls. Male rats exposed to 312 or 625 ppm had significantly increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia. One 625 ppm female and two 1,250 ppm females had histiocytic sarcomas, and the incidence in the 1,250 ppm group exceeded the range in the historical controls. Liver lesions included significantly increased incidences of hepatocytic centrilobular hypertrophy in all exposed groups of males and females, cystic degeneration in 625 and 1,250 ppm males, and bile duct hyperplasia in all exposed groups of females. Incidences of mammary gland fibroadenoma in females exposed to 625 or 1,250 ppm were lower than expected after adjusting for body weight. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were fed diets containing 0, 312, 625, or 1,250 ppm benzophenone (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 40, 80, and 160 mg/kg body weight to males and 35, 70, and 150 mg/kg to females) for 105 weeks. Survival of all exposed groups of mice was generally similar to that of the control groups. Mean body weights of exposed females were less than vehicle controls. Feed consumption by exposed males and females was similar to that by the controls. In male mice, there were significantly increased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma in the 625 and 1,250 ppm groups, and these incidences exceeded the historical control range. All hepatocellular neoplasms combined occurred with a positive trend. In female mice, the incidences of hepatocellular adenoma in the 625 and 1,250 ppm groups were higher than expected after adjusting for the lower body weights in these groups. Incidences of centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy were significantly increased in all exposed groups of males and females. All exposed groups of male mice had significant increases in the incidences of multinucleated hepatocytes and chronic active inflammation. The incidences of cystic degeneration of hepatocytes in 625 and 1,250 ppm males were significantly increased. The incidence of histiocytic sarcoma in 625 ppm females was significantly increased and exceeded the historical control range. The incidences of kidney nephropathy and mineralization in exposed groups of females and the severity of nephropathy in exposed groups of males were significantly increased. The incidences of metaplasia of the olfactory epithelium were significantly increased in 1,250 ppm males and females. The incidences of hyperplasia of lymphoid follicles in the spleen were significantly increased in all exposed groups of males and in 312 and 625 ppm females. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Benzophenone was not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537, with or without hamster or rat liver activation enzymes. No significant increases in the frequencies of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes were seen in bone marrow samples from male mice administered benzophenone three times by intraperitoneal injection. In addition, no increases in micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes were noted in peripheral blood of male or female mice administered benzophenone for 14 weeks in dosed feed. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of benzophenone in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of renal tubule adenoma; mononuclear cell leukemia in male F344/N rats may have been related to benzophenone exposure. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of benzophenone in female F344/N rats based on the marginally increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia and histiocytic sarcoma. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of benzophenone in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms, primarily adenoma. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of benzophenone in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of histiocytic sarcoma; the incidences of hepatocellular adenoma in female B6C3F1 mice may have been related to benzophenone exposure. Administration of benzophenone in feed resulted in increased incidences and/or severities of nonneoplastic lesions in the kidney and liver of male and female rats and in the liver, kidney, nose, and spleen of male and female mice. Decreased incidences of mammary gland fibroadenoma in female rats were related to benzophenone exposure. "
"Abstract: The efficacy of tretinoin is well established in the treatment of acne and photoaged skin, however as a typical side effect of tretinoin treatment most patients develop a low-grade irritant dermatitis. Since isotretinoin topical treatment usually shows much lower incidence and intensity of adverse effects than tretinoin topical treatment, histological studies are needed to scientifically evaluate the effects of isotretinoin application on epidermis and also to assess if it can be used in anti-aging products as an alternative to tretinoin. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the effects of topical use of tretinoin or isotretinoin on hairless mice epidermis, using appropriate histopathological and histometric techniques, in order to evaluate the influence of isomerism on skin effects. For this, gel cream formulations containing or not 0.05% tretinoin or 0.05% isotretinoin were applied in the dorsum of hairless mice, once a day for seven days. Histopathological evaluation, viable epidermal and horny layer thicknesses as well as the number of epidermal cell layers were determined. Our results showed that tretinoin and isotretinoin were effective in the enhancement of viable epidermis thickness and number of epidermal cell layers, suggesting that they could be used for stimulation of cellular renewal. However isomerism influenced skin effects since isotretinoin had more pronounced effects than tretinoin in viable epidermis. In addition only isotretinoin treatment enhanced horny layer thickness when compared to the gel cream treatment. "
"AIM: This study was undertaken to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and the toxicity of the intravitreal biodegradable poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide)co-polymer microspheres containing cyclosporin A (CsA-PLGA-MS) on experimental uveitis in rabbits. METHODS: CsA-PLGA-MS that had been prepared by a solvent evaporation approach were characterized for morphology, particle size, entrapment efficiency, and in vitro release profile of CsA-PLGA-MS. Therapeutic efficacy of the CsA-PLGA-MS was evaluated by scoring of the inflammation, aqueous leukocyte counting, aqueous protein determination, and histological examination in the experimental rabbits with artificial uveitis induced by the injection of lipopolysaccharide. The toxicity was investigated by slit-lamp examination, indirect ophthalmoscopy, and electroretinography (ERG) in the noninflamed rabbit eye. RESULTS: The CsA-PLGA-MS were spherical in shape, with an average particle size of nearly 50 microm and an entrapment efficiency of more than 80%. The compositions of the formulation that was most effective in the in vivo studies included CsA, PLGA, and 3% Pluronic F68. In vitro released cyclosporine A from the optimized microspheres was approximately 25% during the 60-day incubation at 37 degrees C. It was demonstrated that the intravitreal injection of the optimized CsA-PLGA-MS decreased significantly the severity of the inflammatory signs, cellular infiltrate, aqueous leukocyte counts, and protein levels in the eyes of experimental rabbits with uveitis, compared to other formulations. Also, the preparation did not cause obvious toxicity in the noninflamed eyes of rabbits, except that the ERG b-wave amplitude for the test eyes was reversibly depressed, compared to those of the control eyes at 2 weeks, which almost recovered at the end of 6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The CsA-PLGA-MS preparation might be useful in the treatment of patients with severe chronic posterior uveitis who cannot tolerate systemic or periocular therapy. "
"Abstract: Human environmental and dietary exposure to trans-capsaicin--the pungent ingredient in chili peppers--is ubiquitous. Moreover, based on the highly selective agonism of trans-capsaicin for TRPV1 receptors, drug products containing high concentrations of trans-capsaicin are under development as analgesics. For instance, a high-concentration (8% w/w) pure trans-capsaicin dermal patch (designated NGX-4010) is in advanced clinical evaluation for the management of neuropathic pain of peripheral origin. Our objective was to investigate effects of trans-capsaicin on embryo/fetal development, consequent to maternal exposure, from implantation to closure of the hard palate. trans-Capsaicin was delivered systemically by means of either a patch [NGX-4010 (25, 37.5, or 50 cm(2))] to pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats on days of presumed gestation (DGs) 7 through 17, or via a 10% w/v capsaicin liquid formulation (CLF), at dosages of 3, 6.5 or 13 mul/cm(2) applied to a 200-cm(2) area on the back on DGs 7 though 19 to timed-mated New Zealand white rabbits. In rats, the maternal no-observable-effect level (NOEL) was less than 25 cm(2) but no cesarean-sectioning or litter parameters were affected by application of NGX-4010 at patch sizes as high as 50 cm(2). The only test article-related observations were delays in skeletal ossification, evident as significant reductions in the average number of metatarsals and ossified hindlimb and forelimb phalanges that occurred in the 50 cm(2) NGX-4010 dose group. Although the values for ossified metatarsals were outside the historical control range, ossified hindlimb and forelimb phalanges were within historical control ranges. No other gross external, soft tissue, or skeletal fetal alterations (malformations or variations) were caused by application of the NGX-4010. In rabbits, the maternal NOEL was less than 3 mul/cm(2) CLF (or 0.3 mg/cm(2)trans-capsaicin) per 200 cm(2), but no cesarean-sectioning or litter parameters were affected. No fetal alterations (malformations or variations) were caused by dosages of CLF as high as 13 mul/cm(2) (or 1.3 mg/cm(2)trans-capsaicin). Taken together, these data suggest that tran s-capsaicin should not be considered a developmental toxicant. "
"Abstract: Rosacea is a common, recurrent, inflammatory dermatologic disorder characterized by the presence of facial erythema, visible blood vessels, papules, and pustules. The condition may cause serious psychologic morbidity and may significantly affect quality of life. The first topical rosacea therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration was metronidazole for the treatment of inflammatory lesions and erythema. Previously, metronidazole was available as a 0.75% gel. Improved solubility was achieved in a new, stable, aqueous gel that permitted the formulation of metronidazole 1.0%. This new formulation is highly spreadable, easy to use, cosmetically friendly, mild to the skin, nondrying, and moisturizing. The safety of metronidazole 1% gel was determined by the evaluation of its cumulative irritation, contact sensitization, phototoxicity, and photoallergy potential in healthy male and female patients. In this formulation, metronidazole was not irritating under occlusive application. Additionally, metronidazole 1% gel had a low potential for causing sensitization reactions, and no evidence suggested phototoxic or photoallergic reactions. "
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The therapeutic efficacy of the tretinoin products Tretin-X (Triax Pharmaceuticals, Cranford, NJ) and Retin-A (Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ) in the treatment of acne vulgaris was compared in four bioequivalence studies. METHODS: Four double-blind, three-treatment, parallel-group studies randomly assigned 1642 adolescents and adults, 12-40 years of age, with mild-to-severe acne vulgaris to receive topical tretinoin therapy with Tretin-X, Retin-A, or placebo (drug vehicle) as 0.1% cream (study 1), 0.025% cream (study 2), 0.025% gel (study 3), and 0.01% gel (study 4) once daily for 84 days. The primary efficacy measures were overall acne severity and the number of inflammatory lesions. The secondary efficacy measure was the total number of lesions. RESULTS: In each trial, Tretin-X and Retin-A were clinically equivalent according to all primary and secondary end points at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12, a finding also demonstrated by the averaged scores from Weeks 2 through 12. Moreover, each active treatment was significantly more efficacious than placebo at the conclusion of the study (p<or=0.05). Both of the Tretin-X and Retin-A formulations compared in each study were well tolerated. The severity of erythema and peeling did not differ significantly among the three groups studied. CONCLUSIONS: The four bioequivalence studies demonstrated that Tretin-X and Retin-A tretinoin products behaved similarly in patients with mild-to-severe acne vulgaris and were thus clinically bioequivalent. Both treatments were well tolerated, and their associated adverse events were similar to those with placebo. "
"BACKGROUND: Until recently, no prescription drug containing permethrin for the therapy of scabies was available on the German market.Therefore, a 5% permethrin cream formulation (InfectoScab 5%) was tested in a single-arm multi-center study including adults and children from 3 months of age with proven scabies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: On day 0, patients were treated once with permethrin cream in the study center. Control examinations including dermatoscopy were performed on day 14+/-2 and on day 28+/-3. Patients who were not considered cured or who had contact to individuals with untreated scabies received one further treatment with permethrin cream on day 14+/-2. Itching and local tolerability of the cream were documented in patients' diaries. Side effects were assessed by history, skin inspection and evaluation of patients' notes. RESULTS: 106 patients in 13 centers were enrolled in the study. Their mean age was 29.2 years (range, 141 days to 71.9 years); 34% of them were children or adolescents. 78.3% of patients were either severely (3 body sites) or very severely (4-5 sites) affected. The cure rate on day 28+/-3 was 95.1% (95% confidence interval, 91.0-99.3%). Pruritus declined markedly and continuously. In general, the cream was well tolerated; side effects were almost invariably mild. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the efficacy and safety of 5% permethrin cream in adults, children and infants suffering from scabies. These results have contributed to the approval of InfectoScab 5% in Germany for the treatment of scabies in October 2004. "
"Abstract: Tinea infections are among the most common dermatological conditions throughout the world. Griseofulvin is a classical oral fungistatic antibiotic, active against Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton and Microsporum species, the causative fungi of tinea corporis. To evaluate the efficacy of topical griseofulvin in the treatment of tinea circinata using three different vehicles for drug delivery. Sixteen patients with tinea circinata were instructed to apply either griseofulvin gel form in group A or a similar placebo gel for control group; a niosomal gel formulation of griseofulvin for group B or; a liposomal gel formulation of griseofulvin for group C. Patients were evaluated both clinically and mycologically after 3 weeks. Marked improvement was seen for groups A, B and C both clinically and mycologically while no improvement was observed in the placebo group. Mild and transient irritation was reported in four patients. Our results show that topical griseofulvin preparations may be effective and safe in treating tinea circinata and that further large-scale studies may establish the high efficacy of the niosomal gel formulation.

"PURPOSE: To investigate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of a new oral formulation of paclitaxel containing the polymer polyvinyl acetate phthalate in patients with advanced solid tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of six patients received oral paclitaxel as single agent given as a single dose of 100 mg on day 1, oral paclitaxel 100 mg in combination with cyclosporin A (CsA) 10 mg/kg both given as a single dose on day 8, and i.v. paclitaxel (Taxol) 100 mg as a 3-h infusion on day 15. RESULTS: The AUC (mean +/- standard deviation) values of paclitaxel after oral administration without CsA and with CsA were 476 +/- 254 and 967 +/- 779 ng/ml h, respectively. T (max) was 4.0 +/- 0.9 h after oral paclitaxel without CsA, and 6.0 +/- 3.1 h after oral paclitaxel with CsA. The mean AUC after oral administration as single agent was 13% of the AUC after i.v. administration of paclitaxel, and increased to 26% after co-administration with CsA. No haematological toxicities were observed, and only mild (CTC-grade 1 and 2) non-hematological toxicities occurred after oral intake of paclitaxel with or without CsA. CONCLUSION: The AUC of the new polymeric paclitaxel formulation increased a factor 2 in combination with CsA, which confirms that CsA co-administration can also improve exposure to paclitaxel after oral administration of a polymeric formulation. Because of the delayed release of paclitaxel from this formulation, we hypothesize that a split-dose regimen of CsA where it is administered before and after paclitaxel administration will further increase the systemic exposure to paclitaxel up to therapeutic levels. The formulation was well tolerated at the dose of 100 mg without induction of severe toxicities. "
"BACKGROUND: Dyschromias are common and significantly impact patients' quality of life. Formulas containing hydroquinone 4% are effective in these conditions. Since exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) can worsen disease and complicate treatment, the incorporation of sunscreens can avert this problem. METHODS: We tested the sun protection factor of a hydroquinone formulation (Lustra-Ultra, TaroPharma, Hawthorne, NY) containing avobenzone 3%, and octinoxate 7.5% according to the FDA Sunscreen Monograph on 20 volunteer subjects. We also determined the UVR absorbance spectrum of the preparation. RESULTS: The mean sun protection factor (SPF) of 21.7 satisfied labeling requirements for SPF 20. The formulation exhibited strongest photoprotection near the wavelengths of peak sun burning effectiveness in the UVB region and maintains significant UVR absorbance through the entire UVA region. CONCLUSIONS: Avobenzone 3% and octinoxate 7.5% provide broad spectrum UV protection. Incorporating these sunscreens into a hydroquinone preparation simplifies the treatment regimen while providing significant photoprotection for patients being treated for dyschromia. "
"Abstract: The childhood diarrhoea-management guidelines of the World Health Organization/United Nations Children's Fund (WHO/UNICEF) now include zinc treatment, 20 mg per day for 10 days. To determine if a dispersible zinc sulphate tablet formulation is associated with increased risk of vomiting or regurgitation following the initial, first treatment dose, a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was carried out in the Dhaka hospital of ICDDR,B: Centre for Health and Population Research (n=800) and in an adjacent NGO outpatient clinic (n=800). Children were randomized to one of three groups: no treatment, placebo, or zinc sulphate tablet (20 mg). They were then observed for 60 minutes, and all vomiting or regurgitation episodes were recorded. When compared with placebo, zinc treatment resulted in an attributable risk increase of 14% for vomiting and 5.2% for regurgitation. The median time to vomiting among those receiving zinc was 9.6 minutes and was limited to one episode in 91.2% of the cases. Overall, the proportion of 60-minute post-treatment vomiting attributable to zinc, placebo, and the illness episode was estimated to be 40%, 26%, and 34% respectively. The dispersible zinc sulphate tablet formulation at a dose of 20 mg is associated with increased risks of vomiting and regurgitation. Both are transient side-effects. "
"OBJECTIVE: To assess safety, clinical response, and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous (SC) and intramuscular (IM) doses of an experimental formulation of infliximab [including experimental SC doses following administration of commercially-formulated intravenous (IV) infliximab] in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) refractory to methotrexate. METHODS: In this randomized, open-label, 3-stage design, 43 subjects were enrolled in 7 dose groups. In Stage I, 15 subjects received single SC doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 3.0 mg/kg. In Stage II, 21 subjects received one of 3 regimens: 100 mg SC every 2 weeks (3 injections); 3 mg/kg commercially-formulated IV infliximab every 2 weeks (2 infusions) followed by 100 mg SC every 2 weeks (3 injections); or 100 mg IM every 2 weeks (3 injections). In Stage III, 7 subjects received 100 mg SC every 4 weeks (3 injections). RESULTS: No treatment-related serious adverse events were observed, and there were no serious injection site reactions. A low-titer infliximab antibody response was detected in 27% of subjects receiving single SC doses, 5% receiving multiple SC doses, and 43% receiving IM doses. SC administration yielded roughly dose-proportional increases in Cmax and AUC. American College of Rheumatology 20% response (ACR20) was achieved 2 weeks after the last injection by 86.7% of subjects receiving single SC doses, 85.7% receiving SC doses every 2 weeks, 85.7% receiving both IV and SC doses, 57.1% receiving multiple IM doses, and 80.0% receiving SC doses every 4 weeks. CONCLUSION: SC and IM treatment with this experimental infliximab formulation was well tolerated and was associated with a favorable ACR response. "
"Abstract: For the development of an optimized oral formulation for cyclosporine A, 2% of this drug has been formulated in solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN, mean size 157 nm) and as nanocrystals (mean size 962 nm). The encapsulation rate of SLN was found to be 96.1%. Nanocrystals are composed of 100% of drug. For the assessment of the pharmacokinetic parameters the developed formulations have been administered via oral route to three young pigs. Comparison studies with a commercial Sandimmun Neoral/Optoral used as reference have been performed. The blood profiles observed after oral administration of the commercial microemulsion Sandimmun revealed a fast absorption of drug leading to the observation of a plasma peak above 1,000 ng/ml within the first 2 h. For drug nanocrystals most of the blood concentrations were in the range between 30 and 70 ng/ml over a period of 14 h. These values were very low, showing huge differences between the measuring time points and between the tested animals. On the contrary, administration of cyclosporine-loaded SLN led to a mean plasma profile with almost similarly low variations in comparison to the reference microemulsion, however with no initial blood peak as observed with the Sandimmun Neoral/Optoral. Comparing the area under the curves (AUC) obtained with the tested animals it could be stated that the SLN formulation avoids side effects by lacking blood concentrations higher than 1,000 ng/ml. In this study it has been proved that using SLN as a drug carrier for oral administration of cyclosporine A a low variation in bioavailability of the drug and simultaneously avoiding the plasma peak typical of the first Sandimmun formulation can be achieved. "
"BACKGROUND: It has been thought that topical gels are inherently more irritating than topical creams. Nevertheless, the irritancies of topical products are potentially quite variable, and a priori assumptions about relative irritancy of gels versus creams may not be accurate. PURPOSE: To determine whether a metronidazole gel formulation is more or less irritating to the skin compared to metronidazole creams. METHODS: A total of 32 normal, healthy volunteers were tested using irritancy patches with 0.75% metronidazole gel and cream, 1% metronidazole cream, and petrolatum (used as the ""negative control""). Blinded observers evaluated the application sites for signs of irritancy. A numerical score was assigned to these irritancy patch sites each day for 21 days, or until significant irritation developed, and cumulative irritancy scores were calculated for the study period. A mixed model of variance analysis was performed. RESULTS: After 21 days of evaluation, analysis of the mean cumulative irritancy scores for each of the agents used showed there to be no statistical difference in irritancy potential between the metronidazole gel and the metronidazole creams. However, the 1% metronidazole cream was significantly more irritating than petrolatum. CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in the cumulative irritancy potential of cream and gel preparations of metronidazole. The irritancy of topical formulations for treating rosacea should be considered on a case by case basis. "
"BACKGROUND: Previous multicenter, randomized trials, lacking standardized post-transplant protocols, have compared tacrolimus (Tac) and cyclosporine (CyA, Sandimmune) and demonstrated similar outcomes with some different adverse effects. The microemulsion form of CyA (mCyA, Neoral) has replaced Sandimmune CyA as the more widely utilized CyA formulation. This is the first 5-year follow-up study of a large, single-center trial (n = 67) under a standardized post-transplant protocol comparing Tac and mCyA. METHODS: Sixty-seven heart transplant patients were randomized to Tac (n = 33) or mCyA (n = 34), both in combination with corticosteroids and azathioprine without cytolytic induction. Five-year end-points included survival, Grade > or = 3A or treated rejection, angiographic cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV; any lesion > or = 30% stenosis), renal dysfunction (creatinine > or = 2.0 mg/dl), use of two or more anti-hypertensive medications, percent diabetic and lipid levels. RESULTS: Five-year survival, freedom from Grade > or = 3A or any treated rejection and angiographic CAV, mean cholesterol level and percent diabetic were similar between the two groups. The Tac group had a significantly lower 5-year mean triglyceride level (Tac 97 +/- 34 vs mCyA 175 +/- 103 mg/dl, p = 0.011) and average serum creatinine level (Tac 1.2 +/- 0.5 mg/dl vs mCyA 1.5 +/- 0.4 mg/dl, p = 0.044). There was a trend toward fewer patients requiring two or more anti-hypertensive drugs in the Tac group (Tac 33% vs mCyA 59%, p = 0.065). CONCLUSIONS: Tac and mCyA appear to be comparable with regard to 5-year survival, freedom from rejection and CAV. However, compared with mCyA, Tac appears to reduce the adverse effect profile for hypertriglyceridemia and renal dysfunction and the need for hypertensive medications. "
"Abstract: Licochalcone A (LicA), a major phenolic constituent of the licorice species Glycyrrhiza inflata, has recently been reported to have anti-inflammatory as well as anti-microbial effects. These anti-inflammatory properties might be exploited for topical applications of LicA. We conducted prospective randomized vehicle-controlled clinical trials to assess the anti-irritative efficacy of cosmetic formulations containing LicA in a post-shaving skin irritation model and on UV-induced erythema formation. The clinical trials were accompanied by a series of in vitro experiments to characterize anti-inflammatory properties of LicA on several dermatologically relevant cell types. Topical LicA causes a highly significant reduction in erythema relative to the vehicle control in both the shave- and UV-induced erythema tests, demonstrating the anti-irritative properties of LicA. Furthermore, LicA is a potent inhibitor of pro-inflammatory in vitro responses, including N-formyl-MET-LEU-PHE (fMLP)- or zymosan-induced oxidative burst of granulocytes, UVB-induced PGE(2) release by keratinocytes, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PGE(2) release by adult dermal fibroblasts, fMLP-induced LTB(4) release by granulocytes, and LPS-induced IL-6/TNF-alpha secretion by monocyte-derived dendritic cells. The reported data suggest therapeutic skin care benefits from LicA when applied to sensitive or irritated skin. "
"Abstract: A novel lotion formulation of fluticasone propionate 0.05% has recently become available. Two large, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies involving 438 subjects demonstrated its efficacy and safety when applied once daily in the treatment of atopic dermatitis in subjects from 3 months to 87 years of age. The studies were limited to 4 weeks duration of use of fluticasone lotion and did not assess longer term efficacy or side effects. "
"Abstract: Evaluations of the efficiency of a new formulation of chlorin consisting of a complex of trisodium salt chlorin e6 (Ce6) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and fluorescence diagnosis was performed on poorly differentiated human bladder carcinoma murine model with the following specific aims: (i) to qualitatively evaluate the fluorescence accumulation in human bladder tumor, (ii) to determine fluorescence distribution of Ce6-PVP using the tissue extraction technique and fluorescence imaging technique, (iii) to compare the fluorescence distribution of Ce6, Ce6-PVP and Photofrin in skin of nude mice, and (iv) to investigate phototoxicity caused by different parameters (drug-light interval, drug dose, irradiation fluence rate and total light fluence) in PDT. The fluorescence of the Ce6-PVP formulation was determined either by fluorescence imaging measurements or by chemical extraction from the tissues displaying similar trends of distribution. Our results demonstrated that the Ce6-PVP formulation possesses less in vivo phototoxic effect compared to Ce6 alone. The phototoxicity revealed a strong dependence on the drug and light dosimetry as well as on the drug-light interval. In PDT, the Ce6-PVP compound was most toxic at the 1h drug-light interval at 200J/cm(2), while Ce6 alone was most toxic at a light dose of more that 50J/cm(2) at the 1 and 3h drug-light interval. We also confirmed that Ce6-PVP has a faster clearance compared to Ce6 alone or Photofrin. This eliminates the need for long-term photosensitivity precautions. In conclusion, the Ce6-PVP formulation seems to be a promising photosensitizer for fluorescence imaging as well as for photodynamic treatment. "
"Abstract: All-trans retinoic acid (atRA) which could smooth wrinkles and produce less pigmented skin after a few months of treatment has been studied in research into topical treatments for a potent inhibitor of new melanin production. However, the clinical responses of commercial atRA cream predominantly comprise severe inflammation. We report a novel nanotechnology ""nanoegg"" system giving improved effects of atRA self-assembly which were coated by CaCO3. Dorsal areas of hairless mouse and porcine skin were employed for administration of nanoegg ointment and commercial products. The mRNA for heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) from tissues was measured by a real-time PCR method. All tissues were stained for detection of hyaluronate and the thickness of the epidermis. A clinical trial in humans was carried out at St. Marianna University in Japan. As a result, the irritation and inflammation associated with atRA molecules were substantially reduced. The physicochemical instability of atRA was also dramatically improved. Furthermore, nanoegg enhanced marked expression of mRNA for HB-EGF from keratinocytes, which is known as one of the markers of keratinocyte turnover. Also, production of hyaluronate was surprisingly in the intercellular spaces of the basal and spinous cell layers 2 days after treatment. Even at the low concentration of atRA in the nanoegg system, the proliferation and differentiation of keratinocyte was somewhat enhanced. A nanoegg may thus not only prevent adverse effects, but also markedly enhance the main effect. "
"Abstract: Camptothecins represent an established class of effective agents that selectively target topoisomerase I by trapping the catalytic intermediate of the topoisomerase I-DNA reaction, the cleavage complex. The water-soluble salt camptothecin-sodium - introduced in early trials in the 1960s - was highly toxic in animals, whereas the semisynthetic derivatives irinotecan and topotecan did not cause haemorrhagic cystitis because of their higher physicochemical stability and solubility at lower pH values. Myelosuppression, neutropenia and, to a lesser extent, thrombocytopenia are dose-limiting toxic effects of topotecan. In contrast to the structurally-related topotecan, irinotecan is a prodrug which has to be converted to SN-38, its active form. SN-38 is inactivated by conjugation, thus patients with Gilbert's syndrome and other forms of genetic glucuronidation deficiency are at an increased risk of irinotecan-induced adverse effects, such as neutropenia and diarrhoea. The cytotoxic mechanism of podophyllotoxin is the inhibition of topoisomerase II. Common adverse effects of etoposide include dose-limiting myelosuppression. Hypersensitivity reactions are more common with etoposide and teniposide than with etoposide phosphate because the formulations of the former contain sensitising solubilisers. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia occur in 65% and 80%, respectively, of patients after administration of conventional doses of teniposide. Anorexia, vomiting and diarrhoea are generally of mild severity after administration of conventional doses of topoisomerase II inhibitors. Clinical pharmacokinetic studies have revealed substantial interindividual variabilities regarding the area under the concentration-time curve values and steady-state concentrations for all drugs reviewed in this article. Irinotecan, etoposide and teniposide are degraded via complex metabolic pathways. In contrast, topotecan primarily undergoes renal excretion. Regarding etoposide and teniposide, the extent of catechol formation over time during drug metabolism may be associated with a higher risk for secondary malignancies. "
"Abstract: The skin permeability and stability of formoterol fumarate (FF) in matrix patches containing l-menthol as an enhancer and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as the solvent were investigated. Using a total of 28 matrix patches having a similar composition, containing ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) as the forming polymer and hydrogenated rosin glycerol ester (Ester Gum H) as the adhesive, the skin permeation of FF was found to increase with increasing l-menthol and NMP contents. FF in the matrix patches containing NMP in the range of 4.8-7.2% was stable, but stability decreased at higher values. With a standard matrix patch containing FF, the Cmax and AUC(0-24) values were found to be 1.93 ng/ml after 4 h percutaneous application to rats and 25.6 ng x h/ml. The bioavailability after percutaneous exposure was equivalent to 15.2% of the AUC(0-24) after intravenous administration. Percutaneous application proved efficacious with regard to control of simulated asthma at dose levels lower than those with which side effects occurred. Thus an optimized matrix patch containing FF was prepared with potential advantages for control of asthma. "
"Abstract: This in vitro study sought to evaluate the action of a pediatric medication with low pH and high acidity in primary enamel submitted (or not) to daily applications of fluoride dentifrice. For this study, 70 blocks of primary molars (n = 10 per subgroup) were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy. Six subgroups (two control and four experimental) were submitted to different treatments for 10 days. Microscopically, the enamel blocks of the subgroups that received medication and fluoride demonstrated the largest areas of partially or totally conditioned superficial enamel. The opposite was observed in the subgroups that were not exposed to fluoride; erosions in the internal enamel and in the transition zone between deep enamel and dentine showed superior percentiles. It was concluded that the medication modified the morphology of the primary enamel and that the use of fluoride was able to reduce the erosive effect of the formulation. "
"Abstract: The cytotoxicity of povidone-iodine in Repithel, Betaisodona ointment and Betaisodona solution was investigated using CHO-K1 cells. To estimate the vitality of test cells after 30 min contact time using vital dye neutral red, the following IC(50) were determined: 16-18% Repithel, 8-9% Betaisodona ointment and 1.8-2% Betaisodona solution; using MTT for detecting vitality, the IC(50) were: 5-10% Repithel, 1.3-2.5% Betaisodona ointment and 0.6-1.3% Betaisodona solution. Therefore, the first attack of the antiseptic agent iodine to mammalian cells is carried out on enzymes, perhaps by oxidation, followed by membrane attack. Murine fibroblasts were used to compare the cytotoxic impact of povidone-iodine with those of chlorhexidine digluconate (CHex), octenidine dihydrochloride (Oct) and polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB). On the base of molecular concentration, povidone-iodine is more than 20 times better tolerated by L929 cells than CHex, Oct or PHMB. Moreover, after 30 min contact of L929 cells with povidone-iodine, there is a temporarily cytotoxic reaction, which leads after 24 h culture to an unexpected revitalisation of murine fibroblasts. This phenomenon was not detected using CHex, Oct or PHMB. Povidone-iodine seems to be the most tolerated antiseptic in comparison with CHex, Oct or PHMB. "
"BACKGROUND: Loratadine is a long-acting antihistamine with selective peripheral histamine H(1)-receptor antagonistic activity and fewer sedative effects compared with conventional antihistamines, and is widely used in Mexico. Although several generic formulations of loratadine are available in Mexico, based on a literature search, information concerning the bioavailability of each formulation in the Mexican population is not available. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the bioavailability and tolerability of 2 oral formulations of loratadine 20 mg (two 10-mg tablets) used in Mexico: Sensibit (test formulation; Laboratorios Liomont S.A. de C.V., Mexico City, Mexico) and Clarityne (reference formulation; Schering-Plough S.A. de C.V., Mexico City, Mexico) in healthy volunteers. METHODS: This open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover study was conducted at Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico. Eligible subjects were healthy male Mexican volunteers aged > or=18 years. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive a single 20-mg dose (two 10-mg tablets) of the test or reference formulation, followed by a 2-week washout period, followed by the same dose of the alternate formulation. A 400-mg dose of ketoconazole (2 doses in 24 hours) was administered to each subject before the administration of each formulation, and a 200-mg dose of ketoconazole was given together with each formulation (ie, a total of 600 mg of ketoconazole was administered). Doses were administered after a 12-hour overnight fast. For analysis of pharmacokinetic properties, including C(maX), AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-infinity), blood samples were drawn at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, 8, 12, 16, and 22 hours after dosing. The formulations were considered bioequivalent if the geometric mean ratios of C(maX) and AUC were within the predetermined equivalence range of 80% to 125%. Tolerability was assessed by monitoring vital signs and subject interview regarding the potential presence of adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: Thirty-two subjects were enrolled in the study (mean age, 22 years [range, 18-28 years]; mean weight, 68.9 kg [range, 58-79 kg]; mean height, 170.8 cm [range, 158-183 cm]). Sixteen subjects received the test formulation first. No period or sequence effect was observed. The 90% CIs for the corresponding ratios of CmaX, AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-infinity) were 81.43% to 106.01%, 83.12% to 100.23%, and 84.06% to 101.10% (all, P < 0.05), meeting the predetermined criteria for bioequivalence. Similar results were found for data without a logarithmic transformation. No AEs were reported throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS: In this small study in healthy Mexican volunteers, a single, 20-mg dose of the test formulation of loratadine was found to be bioequivalent to that of the reference formulation based on the rate and extent of absorption when concomitantly administered with ketoconazole. Both formulations were well tolerated. "
"BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris is an extremely common skin disorder that can be treated effectively with drugs that are currently available. Poor compliance, however, is a major factor in the high failure rates seen in acne treatment. Compliance might be enhanced by considering patient preferences for acne medications. Conjoint analysis is well suited for the study of patient preferences in healthcare, but is novel to the field of dermatology. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to determine and compare patient preferences for four topical antibiotics used for 1 week, once or twice daily, to treat acne vulgaris. METHODS: A randomised, phase IV, single-centre, cross-over study was performed using conjoint analysis and a traditional patient questionnaire. Over 4 weeks, the patients used each of four topical antibiotics for 1 week: erythromycin/zinc solution, clindamycin phosphate lotion, benzoyl peroxide (BP)/erythromycin gel (each applied twice daily) and clindamycin phosphate gel (applied once daily). The conjoint analysis examined five different attributes of acne medications: form, storage, product life once opened, method of application and regimen (each with two or three possible options). From 108 possible permutations of the five attributes, 16 hypothetical medications were selected at random and described on printed cards. Pre- and post-treatment, the patients ranked the cards in order of preference and rated each hypothetical product based on their likelihood to use it. For each patient, product 'utilities' were then calculated by multiple regression. The patients also completed a patient acceptability questionnaire, by which they rated the product acceptability after 1 week of treatment with each of the four topical antibiotics. The patients later ranked the medications in order of preference after using all four treatments. Adverse events were recorded in diary cards to assess tolerability. RESULTS: Of 67 patients recruited, 64 used all four medications and completed the study. The conjoint analysis found that a gel formulation, room temperature storage, product life of up to 18 months once opened, application with fingers and once-daily regimen were the options ranked first for the five product attributes. According to the ranking order (out of 108) for the combination of attributes representing the four study medications, clindamycin phosphate gel had the highest rankings (6 and 1 pre- and post-treatment, respectively) and BP/erythromycin gel had the lowest rankings (93 and 70 pre- and post-treatment). The rankings of clindamycin phosphate lotion and erythromycin/zinc solution worsened from pre- to post-treatment, indicating a shift in patient preference after they experienced products 'in-use' during the study. Based on the questionnaire, clindamycin phosphate gel was liked best by the highest proportion of patients (33%). In terms of overall satisfaction, the order of preference was: (i) clindamycin phosphate gel, (ii) clindamycin phosphate lotion, (iii) BP/erythromycin gel and (iv) erythromycin/zinc solution. Adverse events related to medication occurred most frequently with erythromycin/zinc solution and BP/erythromycin gel. Clindamycin phosphate gel was the only product not associated with any episodes resulting in a change of medication or dose. CONCLUSIONS: Conjoint analysis provided a convenient, reliable tool for assessing patient preferences for topical antibiotics used to treat acne. The patients clearly preferred a gel formulation that could be applied with the fingers once daily and stored at room temperature for as long as 18 months. One product (clindamycin phosphate gel) combined all five of the preferred attributes, a preference confirmed by the simulated product rankings. These findings of the conjoint analysis are consistent with the safety profiles and the results of the traditional questionnaire. "
"Abstract: Methylprednisolone aceponate (MPA) has been shown to provide rapid, reliable and highly effective treatment of eczematous disorders, with an efficacy comparable to that of most reference topical corticosteroids. It also has excellent local and systemic tolerability. MPA is effective in the treatment of facial and scalp eczema and sunburn and has shown promising results in the treatment of psoriasis. Its rapid efficacy and lack of undesirable local and/or systemic side effects make MPA particularly suitable for use in children and infants. The wide range of formulations (0.1%) of MPA, including cream, ointment, fatty ointment, milk and solution, enable treatment to be tailored to the individual patient. In addition, MPA has the advantage of once-daily application compared with twice-daily treatment for other topical corticosteroids, thereby improving patient safety and promoting patient compliance but without compromising efficacy.

"Abstract: Cutting fluids can become contaminated with metals (e.g., nickel, Ni) and nitrosamines (e.g., N-nitrosodiethanolamine, NDELA) and there is concern that these classes of contaminants can modulate dermal disposition and ultimately the toxicity of cutting fluid additives, such as irritant biocides (e.g., triazine). Biocides are added to these formulations to prevent bacterial degradation of commercial cutting fluids. The purpose of this study was to assess the dermal absorption and skin deposition of 14C-triazine when topically applied to porcine skin in an in vitro flow-through diffusion cell system as aqueous soluble oil (mineral oil, MO) or aqueous synthetic (polyethylene glycol, PEG) mixtures. 14C-Triazine mixtures were formulated with NDELA and/or Ni, or with a combination of three additional cutting fluid additives; namely, 5% linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), 5% triethanolamine (TEA) and 5% sulfurized ricinoleic acid. Neither Ni nor NDELA was absorbed during these 8-h studies. However, 14C-triazine absorption ranged from 2.72 to 3.29% dose in MO and 2.29-2.88% dose in PEG with significantly greater triazine absorption in MO than PEG when all additives and contaminates were present. The difference between these two diluents was most pronounced when NDELA and/or Ni were present in cutting fluids. These contaminants also enhanced triazine deposition on the skin surface and skin tissues especially with PEG-based mixtures. In essence, the dermal disposition of irritant biocides could be dependent on whether the worker is exposed to a soluble oil or synthetic fluid when these contaminants are present. Workers should therefore not only be concerned about dermatotoxicity of these contaminants, but also the modulated dermal disposition of cutting fluid additives when these contaminants are present in cutting fluid formulations.

"PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to optimize and simplify photodynamic therapy using a new liposomal formulation of the photosensitizer meta-(tetrahydroxyphenyl)chlorin [m-THPC (Foscan); liposomal m-THPC (Fospeg)] and to reduce systemic reactions to the photosensitizer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To examine the pharmacokinetics of liposomal m-THPC, we determined tissue and plasma variables in feline patients with spontaneous squamous cell carcinoma. In vivo fluorescence intensity measurements of tumor and skin were done with a fiber spectrophotometer after i.v. injection of m-THPC or liposomal m-THPC in 10 cats. Blood samples, drawn at several time points after photosensitizer administration, were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: None of the liposomal m-THPC-treated cats showed side effects during or after drug injection. Fluorescence intensities, fluorescence ratios (tumor fluorescence divided by skin fluorescence), and bioavailability in the tumor were 2 to 4 times higher with liposomal m-THPC compared with m-THPC. Liposomal m-THPC concentration in the tumor increased constantly to reach a maximum at 4 hours after injection. Plasma concentration and bioavailability were approximately 3 times higher with liposomal m-THPC compared with m-THPC measured at the time points of highest plasma concentration. The distribution half-life was shorter with liposomal m-THPC, resulting in maximal tumor accumulation up to 5.5 times earlier. Maximal tumor accumulation and maximal fluorescence ratio with liposomal m-THPC occurred at the same time point, indicating maximal selectivity. In both groups, all cats responded to therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Liposomal m-THPC was well tolerated by all cats and seems to have superior pharmacokinetic properties compared with m-THPC. The efficacy of the drug warrants further study. "
"Abstract: This study demonstrates the efficacy of cyclosporine included in a regimen for the treatment of steroid-resistant chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy in two children. Clinical response was characterized by either decreased frequency of recurrent weakness or normalized motor function. Nerve conduction studies and monitoring of cyclosporine levels were included in the serial follow-up evaluations, and their results were used in formulating a treatment plan. One of the two children, who had been monitored for 56 months since the onset of the disease, was able to maintain normal muscle strength without recurrent weakness for 39 months, with 5 mg/kg daily of cyclosporine. The other child, who had been taking prednisolone 0.3 mg/kg daily and cyclosporine 5 mg/kg daily, regained ambulation without support while demonstrating a reduction of recurrent weakness. None had adverse effects caused by cyclosporine therapy. We conclude that cyclosporine is an effective drug in the treatment of children with steroid-resistant chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. "
"Abstract: Cyclosporin is a potent immunosuppressant drug commonly used to prevent organ transplant rejection. In recent years, there has been a widening of its therapeutic use and an increase in the number of patients undergoing transplantation. Gingival overgrowth is one of several oral side-effects of cyclosporin, with a quoted prevalence of between 8% and 100%. There is continued debate over the factors which modify the degree of overgrowth, including individual sensitivity, age, dose of drug, duration of drug therapy and the presence of dental plaque. The exact mechanism of gingival overgrowth is still being debated, but appears to be caused by a combination of the proliferation of fibroblasts within the gingival tissue, an increase in the deposition of collagen and extracellular matrix, and a decrease in phagocytosis with a net gain in gingival tissue mass. A number of treatment options are utilized in the treatment of gingival overgrowth, including CO2 laser surgery, improved oral hygiene, the use of antibiotics such as metronidazole and azithromycin, and surgical intervention. In the clinical application of cyclosporin, there is little correlation between cyclosporin dose, serum trough levels and total exposure to the drug, making it difficult to achieve the desired therapeutic response. These problems were previously further complicated by the variability of absorption of the drug via the gastrointestinal tract. The original cyclosporin formulation, Sandimmune, was replaced by a new formulation, Neoral, which has a more reliable absorption, and gives a closer correlation between trough concentration levels and individual bioavailability. There is a conflict of opinion over whether or not the side-effect profile of Neoral varies from its precursor Sandimmune. It has yet to be seen whether the increased bioavailability of Neoral will result in an increased severity and prevalence of gingival overgrowth. An alternative immunosuppressant drug, tacrolimus, which is a macrolide antibiotic with a different side-effect profile, has emerged as a substitute for cyclosporin in organ transplantation. However, there have been conflicting reports of its side-effects and its capacity to cause gingival overgrowth. "
"BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for most patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Standard protocols in use typically involve three drug groups each directed to a site in the T-cell activation or proliferation cascade which are central to the rejection process: calcineurin inhibitors (e.g. cyclosporin, tacrolimus), anti-proliferative agents (e.g. azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) and steroids (prednisolone). It remains unclear whether new regimens are more specific or simply more potent immunosuppressants. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of tacrolimus with cyclosporin as primary therapy for kidney transplant recipients. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Renal Group's specialist register and conference proceedings were searched to identify relevant reports of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Two reviewers assessed trials for eligibility, quality and extracted data independently. SELECTION CRITERIA: All RCTs where tacrolimus was compared with cyclosporin for the initial treatment of kidney transplant recipients DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were synthesised (random effects model) and results expressed as relative risk (RR), values <1 favouring tacrolimus, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to examine potential effect modification by differences in trial design and immunosuppressive co-interventions. MAIN RESULTS: 123 reports from 30 trials (4102 patients) were included. At six months graft loss was significantly reduced in tacrolimus-treated recipients (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.86), and this effect was persistent up to three years. Meta-regression showed that this benefit diminished as higher trough levels of tacrolimus were targeted (P = 0.04), after allowing for differences in cyclosporin formulation (P = 0.97) and cyclosporin target trough level (P = 0.38). At one year, tacrolimus patients suffered less acute rejection (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.79), and less steroid-resistant rejection (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.64), but more insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus (RR 1.86, 1.11 to 3.09), tremor, headache, diarrhoea, dyspepsia and vomiting. Cyclosporin-treated recipients experienced significantly more constipation and cosmetic side-effects. We demonstrated no differences in infection or malignancy. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Tacrolimus is superior to cyclosporin in improving graft survival and preventing acute rejection after kidney transplantation, but increases post-transplant diabetes, neurological and gastrointestinal side effects. Treating 100 recipients with tacrolimus instead of cyclosporin would avoid 12 suffering acute rejection, two losing their graft but cause an extra five to become insulin-requiring diabetics. "
"Abstract: Pharmacotherapy is the cornerstone of management in ulcerative colitis. However, controversy remains over optimal medical strategies. Specifically, differences in the onset of action of various drug therapies are thought to influence the achievement and maintenance of remission of disease, yet this is poorly characterised. There is a wide range of recent data concerning aminosalicylates, with much debate as to the relative merits of the various formulations and delivery systems. Meta-analyses confirm the efficacy of aminosalicylates for the induction and maintenance of remission and suggest that the newer agents are comparable in efficacy to sulfasalazine. Among aminosalicylates, data from clinical trials reveal that the onset of action is earlier with balsalazide than mesalazine. Although the efficacy of the newer 5-aminosalicylate agents is no greater than that of sulfasalazine, they have better adverse effect profiles. Factors such as tolerability and adherence appear more important than onset of action in long-term maintenance. Corticosteroids have long been used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, yet there is a paucity of data regarding this. They have a rapid onset of action but considerable systemic adverse effects. Therefore, corticosteroids are reserved for disease that fails to respond to other agents or for primary therapy in patients with severe disease, although there is no universal acceptance of a threshold at which to initiate corticosteroid treatment.Rectal preparations of both aminosalicylates and corticosteroids have been developed in an attempt to exert a more rapid and direct onset of action while minimising adverse systemic effects. In clinical trials, topical preparations of both aminosalicylates and corticosteroids are effective in inducing remission. However, patient acceptability and proximal extent of disease dictate selection of a topical agent more than concern with rate of onset.A wide range of immunomodulators have been investigated in patients with steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis. The thioguanine derivatives are the most widely used but have a limited evidence base to support this use with controlled trials providing equivocal results regarding efficacy in severe ulcerative colitis. In addition, the thioguanine derivatives have a protracted onset of action and a considerable serious adverse effect profile. Calcineurin inhibitors and methotrexate have a more rapid onset of action than the thiopurines but have even less data to support their widespread use. They are widely regarded as salvage therapy and further data are required. Regarding biological agents, infliximab revolutionised the treatment of Crohn's disease, yet results in ulcerative colitis have been disappointing. Further trials are ongoing with great anticipation for more favourable data. The practical clinical implications of any differences between the agents depend on patient satisfaction with various therapies. Noncompliance is a major concern in maintenance therapy and is probably associated with relapse. Dose administration schedules and acceptability of therapy appear to be important factors in adherence. Overall, it is not clear that onset of action has a major influence on patient adherence and addressing issues of compliance may have more direct clinical impact. "
"BACKGROUND: Transplantation enhances the risk of malignancies, due to the chronic use of antirejection medication. In the case of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) the permissive effect of immunosuppression has been extensively studied, and cyclosporine (CsA) appears to play a key role. Here we have compared the incidence of KS in transplant patients receiving Neoral or Sandimmune as a part of their immunosuppressive therapy. METHODS: In all, 668 kidney transplant recipient followed at our Nephrology Unit from 1970 to 2003 entered this retrospective analysis; 300 were on CsA Sandimmune-based and 308 on CsA Neoral-based therapy. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of KS. RESULTS: KS was diagnosed in 20 out of 608 patients given CsA with an incidence rate of 4.7 per 1000 patients per year. No episodes of KS was found in the preCsA era. Among patients on CsA, those treated with Neoral had fourfold higher incidence rate of KS than in the Sandimmune group (10.7 vs. 2.3 per 1000 patients per year). Kaplan-Meier analysis shows that patients on Neoral had lower cumulative KS-free probability than those on Sandimmune. Cox's analysis documented that Neoral was a positive predictor of KS development as compared to Sandimmune (hazard ratio: 2.237). Among patients on Neoral, those who developed KS had higher daily exposure to the drug assessed by pharmacokinetic studies. CONCLUSIONS: In recipients of kidney transplant CsA Neoral increases the risk of KS as compared to the Sandimmune formulation, possibly due to enhanced drug bioavailability and ultimately patients daily CsA exposure.

"BACKGROUND: The incidence of skin cancer has had a rapid increase in Sweden during the last 20 years. Sun exposure is an important preventable risk factor for skin cancer. It is essential to develop interventions to change people's exposure to the sun. The perception of own susceptibility to harm is essential in theories about self-protective behaviour. The aim of the present paper was to examine the associations between different risk perceptions, sun-related behaviour, readiness to change, and optimism bias. METHOD: A total of 722 visitors of a mobile skin cancer screening unit answered a questionnaire in the summer of 2001. The campaign was conducted at five different locations in Sweden. RESULTS: The participants in this study seemed to have realistic believes about the contribution of solar radiation to the risk of developing skin cancer, however, they seriously underestimated skin cancer incidence in the population and the impact of skin cancer on general health. CONCLUSION: People concerned about skin cancer seem to be aware of the fact that sun exposure is an important risk factor for skin cancer, but they fail to use this information in a consistent way to formulate a judgment of their own vulnerability to harm. People need to be informed about the high incidence of skin cancer, the personal risk factors of skin cancer, and the fact that unintentional as well as intentional sun exposure increases the risk of developing skin cancer.

"Abstract: In order to protect consumers from ultraviolet (UV) radiation and enhance light stability of the product, three to eight UV filters are usually added to consumer sunscreen products. High lipophilicity of the UV filters has been shown to cause bioaccumulation in fish and humans, leading to environmental levels of UV filters that are similar to those of PCBs and DDT. In this paper, estrogen-regulated pS2 gene transcription in the human mammary tumor cell line MCF-7 was used as a measure of estrogenicity of four individual UV filters. Since humans are exposed to more than one UV filter at a time, an equipotent binary mixture of 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-benzophenone (BP-3) and its metabolite 2,4-dihydroxy benzophenone (BP-1), as well as an equipotent multi-component mixture of BP-1, BP-3, octyl methoxy cinnamate (OMC) and 3-(4-methylbenzylidene) camphor (4-MBC), were also evaluated for their ability to induce pS2 gene transcription in order to examine additivity. An estrogen receptor-mediated mechanism of action was expected for all UV filters. Therefore, our null-hypothesis was that combined estrogenic responses, measured as increased pS2 gene transcription in MCF-7 cells after exposure to mixtures of UV filters, are additive, according to a concentration-addition model. Not all UV filters produced a full concentration-response curve within the concentration range tested (100 nM-1 microM). Therefore, instead of using EC50 values for comparison, the concentration at which each compound caused a 50% increase of basal pS2 gene transcription was defined as the C50 value for that compound and used to calculate relative potencies. For comparison, the EC50 value of a compound is the concentration at which the compound elicits an effect that is 50% of its maximal effect. Individual UV filters increased pS2 gene transcription concentration-dependently with C50 values of 0.12 microM, 0.5 microM, 1.9 microM, and 1.0 microM for BP-1, BP-3, 4-MBC and OMC, respectively. Estradiol (E2) had a C50 value of 4.8 pM. Experiments with equipotent mixtures all supported our null hypothesis that mixtures of UV filters act additively to activate the estrogen receptor (ER). In view of our results and observed plasma levels it cannot be excluded that daily exposure to sunscreen formulations may have estrogenic effects in humans. "
"Abstract: Most pigment-grade titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) samples that have been tested in pulmonary toxicity tests have been of a generic variety-i.e., generally either uncoated particles or TiO(2) particles containing slightly hydrophilic surface treatments/coatings (i.e., base TiO(2)). The objectives of these studies were to assess in rats, the pulmonary toxicity of inhaled or intratracheally instilled TiO(2) particle formulations with various surface treatments, ranging from 0-6% alumina (Al(2)O(3)) or alumina and 0-11% amorphous silica (SiO(2)). The pulmonary effects induced by TiO(2) particles with different surface treatments were compared to reference base TiO(2) particles and controls. In the first study, groups of rats were exposed to high exposure (dose) concentrations of TiO(2) particle formulations for 4 weeks at aerosol concentrations ranging from 1130-1300 mg/m(3) and lung tissues were evaluated by histopathology immediately after exposure, as well as at 2 weeks and 3, 6, and 12 months postexposure. In the second study, groups of rats were intratracheally instilled with nearly identical TiO(2) particle formulations (when compared to the inhalation study) at doses of 2 and 10 mg/kg. Subsequently, the lungs of saline-instilled and TiO(2)-exposed rats were assessed using both bronchoalveolar (BAL) biomarkers and by histopathology/cell proliferation assessment of lung tissues at 24 h, 1 week, 1 and 3 months postexposure. The results from these studies demonstrated that for both inhalation and instillation, only the TiO(2) particle formulations with the largest components of both alumina and amorphous silica surface treatments produced mildly adverse pulmonary effects when compared to the base reference control particles. In summary, two major conclusions can be drawn from these studies: (1) surface treatments can influence the toxicity of TiO(2) particles in the lung; and (2) the intratracheal instillation-derived, pulmonary bioassay studies represent an effective preliminary screening tool for inhalation studies with the identical particle-types used in this study.

"Abstract: In the treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris, the combination of an antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide provides enhanced efficacy over the individual agents, with the potential to decrease the emergence of resistant strains of P. acnes. To evaluate treatment regimens combining the daily use of a clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide gel, a tretinoin gel, and a clindamycin gel, the current randomized, evaluator-blind study was conducted. Results demonstrate that once-daily administration of clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide gel (combination formulation) was as effective as clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide gel + tretinoin gel + clindamycin gel. Both of these regimens provided greater efficacy than tretinoin + clindamycin. Treatment with clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide demonstrated a significant benefit over other treatments at Week 2, highlighting its rapid onset of action. All regimens were safe and generally well tolerated, with less severe peeling seen in patients who received clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide. In conclusion, the regimens that included clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide were more effective than tretinoin + clindamycin in the treatment of acne vulgaris, with no clinical advantage of adding tretinoin + clindamycin to once-daily clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide treatment.

"OBJECTIVE: To compare the positive and negative effects of tacrolimus and ciclosporin as initial treatment for renal transplant recipients. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: Reports of comparative randomised trials of tacrolimus and ciclosporin identified by searches of Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Renal Group Specialist Register, and conference proceedings. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers assessed trials for eligibility and quality and extracted data independently. Data were synthesised (random effects model) and results expressed as relative risk (RR), with values < 1 favouring tacrolimus. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to examine potential effect modification by differences in trial design and immunosuppressive co-interventions. RESULTS: 123 reports from 30 trials (4102 patients) were included. At six months, graft loss was significantly reduced in tacrolimus treated recipients (RR = 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.86), and this effect persisted up to three years. The relative reduction in graft loss with tacrolimus diminished with higher concentrations of tacrolimus (P = 0.04) but did not vary with ciclosporin formulation (P = 0.97) or ciclosporin concentration (P = 0.38). At one year, tacrolimus treated patients had less acute rejection (RR = 0.69, 0.60 to 0.79) and less steroid resistant rejection (RR = 0.49, 0.37 to 0.64) but more diabetes mellitus requiring insulin (RR = 1.86, 1.11 to 3.09), tremor, headache, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, and vomiting. The relative excess of diabetes increased with higher concentrations of tacrolimus (P = 0.003). Ciclosporin treated recipients had significantly more constipation and cosmetic side effects. No differences were seen in infection or malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: Treating 100 recipients with tacrolimus instead of ciclosporin for the first year after transplantation avoids 12 patients having acute rejection and two losing their graft but causes an extra five patients to develop insulin dependent diabetes. Optimal drug choice may vary between patients. "
"Abstract: Over the last 20 years, cyclosporine (CsA) has been the mainstay of immunosuppression in renal transplantation. Initially, CsA was administered at high doses, which enhanced its potential nephrotoxicity. Better handling of the drug was obtained by lowering the dose, monitoring CsA concentration and renal function, and using graft biopsy in difficult cases. In the early 1990s, a new microemulsion showed better pharmacokinetics and efficacy than did the previous formulation. A few years later, evidence showed that checking blood levels 2 hours after administration was a more reliable indicator of CsA exposure than were trough blood levels. The combination with newer immunosuppressive drugs allowed further reduction in the doses of CsA to maintain stable renal allograft function and to improve long-term graft survival. CsA has largely been used in autoimmune diseases. There is concern about its nephrotoxicity, however, as in some studies control renal biopsies showed that CsA-treated patients developed progressive interstitial fibrosis. The risk of nephrotoxicity was related to the initial doses of CsA and to the increase in serum creatinine. Avoiding CsA in patients with creatinine clearance <60 mL/min and in those with uncontrolled hypertension, starting with CsA microemulsion at doses not higher than 4 mg/kg, and reducing the doses whenever serum creatinine increases to 30% or more over baseline may prevent deterioration of renal function. If these guidelines are followed, CsA may be safely used in autoimmune diseases. "
"Abstract: Several topical treatments such as ointments, keratolytics, dithranol, tar, corticosteroids and Vitamin D3 analogues are commonly used in the treatment of mild and/or moderate psoriasis. These treatments can be associated with a variety of local and systemic side effects, as well as to very often unsatisfactory results. The purpose of this critical review of the literature is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the synthesis of new analogues of the Vitamin D3 Tacalcitol, which is formulated in ointment form at a concentration of 4 microg/g, for the treatment of mild and/or moderate psoriasis (involvement of <20% of the surface of the skin) and to evaluate whether this drug can be used in the treatment of other skin conditions. Based on existing data in the literature, Tacalcitol is an effective drug for the topical treatment of psoriasis and is also able to ensure that the effects last over time, even after treatment has stopped. Tacalcitol is also well tolerated because the onset of side effects, such as local irritation, pruriginous or burning sensations, were reported in only a small percentage of the subjects who were treated. Lastly, the marked regulatory effects it has on the proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes, as well as on the immunocompetent cells, has led to suggestions that Tacalcitol may be used in other keratinisation disorders and in some hyperproliferative skin diseases. Evaluation of the effective indications to use in these conditions still requires further data confirming its effectiveness, opening the way to wider use of this molecule in dermatology. "
"BACKGROUND: Dosing of the microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine (Neoral) is conventionally based on trough levels (C(0)). However, experience in renal transplantation has shown that cyclosporine exposure during the absorption phase (AUC(0-4)) is critical for optimizing immunosuppression, and that cyclosporine (CsA) concentration at 2 hours post-dose (C(2)) shows the closest correlation with AUC(0-4). This study evaluated whether C(2) values correlate more closely with AUC(0-4) than C(0) in lung transplant patients. METHODS: Pharmacokinetic data were collected prospectively from 20 clinically stable adult lung allograft recipients receiving CsA, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids. Indications for transplantation were emphysema (n = 15), idiopathic fibrosis (n = 2), primary pulmonary hypertension (n = 1), cystic fibrosis (n = 1) and lymphangioleiomyomatosis LAM (n = 1). Blood samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours after administration of CsA, and then AUC(0-4) was calculated. The Correlation between cyclosporine concentration at each time-point and AUC(0-4) was also calculated. RESULTS: C(2) showed the closest correlation with AUC(0-4) (r(2) = 0.85). C(0) had the poorest correlation of all time-points (r(2) = 0.64). Two patients with radiologic signs of gastroparesis had no peak cyclosporine levels at all and were excluded from the correlation analysis. Mean AUC(0-4) was 3,700 ng . h/ml during Year 1 post-transplant, 2,400 ng . h/ml during Years 1 to 3, and 1,500 ng . h/ml thereafter. Mean C(2) values were 1.2 microg/ml during Year 1, 0.8 microg/ml during Years 1 to 3, and 0.5 microg/ml thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: C(2) is the single time-point that correlates most closely with AUC(0-4) in lung transplant recipients without gastroparesis. It remains to be demonstrated whether monitoring CsA based on C(2) levels results in a lower incidence of rejection without additional toxicity. "
"BACKGROUND: Modern medicine is rooted in ethnobotanical traditions using indigenous flora to treat symptoms of human diseases or to improve specific aspects of the body condition. Herbal medicine is now used by over half of the American population. Yet the American medical community generally lacks knowledge of the function, metabolism, interaction, adverse reactions, and preparation of herbal products. OBJECTIVE: Because over 60 botanicals are marketed in cosmeceutical formulations, dermatologists need to obtain working knowledge of the major botanicals. The preparation, traditional uses, mechanisms of action, human clinical data, adverse reactions, and interactions all impact herbal efficacy and are discussed below. METHOD: English-language medical journal and symposium searches. RESULTS: The most important botanicals pertaining to dermatologic uses, such as cosmeceuticals, include teas, soy, pomegranate, date, grape seed, Pycnogenol, horse chestnut, German chamomile, curcumin, comfrey, allantoin, and aloe. All are documented to treat dermatologic conditions. Only green and black tea, soy, pomegranate, and date have published clinical trials for the treatment of parameters of extrinsic aging. CONCLUSIONS: Preparation of botanical-based cosmeceuticals is complex. Very few of these products are supported by evidence-based science. "
"AIMS: To determine the safety and efficacy of a cream formulation of 0.05% isotretinoin with sunscreens (SPF 15) (I+S) in the treatment of photoaged skin. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: A 6-month, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled study of 346 subjects with photoaged skin, as defined by the presence of fine lines in the periorbital region. The main outcome measure was profilometry measurements of replicas of the periorbital region, taken at 0 and 6 months. Subsidiary outcome measures were clinical scoring of wrinkles/fine lines at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 9 months and histopathology at 0 and 6 months. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 172 subjects were randomized to 0.05% I+S and 174 subjects to vehicle. Subjects used the study medication topically, once-daily for 6 months, followed by a 3-month washout period. Profilometry measurements of the distance between the highest peak and lowest valley (Rz) and the distance between all valleys and peaks from mid-line (Ra) showed that subjects using I+S had statistically significant improvement (p<0.05) compared with the vehicle group. Additionally, at all visits, VAS clinical scoring of wrinkles/fine lines showed a statistically significant difference between the groups in favour of I+S. Tolerance assessments showed that more subjects in the I+S group experienced local side effects at the start of the study; however, reports of side effects decreased over time in both groups. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that I+S improves the appearance of fine wrinkles associated with photoaged skin. "
"BACKGROUND: A group of vitamin D derivatives has revealed to be an efficient treatment for psoriasis. Different types of studies have been designed to confirm the efficacy of its use without relevant side-effects. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of tolerability and efficacy of tacalcitol ointment in moderate psoriasis. DESIGN: A 2-month multicentre prospective open-label observational study in patients with psoriasis treated with tacalcitol ointment. METHODS: A cohort of patients with psoriasis vulgaris seeking medical advice and being treated with tacalcitol based on the decision of their dermatologists was selected. A 2-month follow-up was performed to assess efficacy and tolerability of tacalcitol in an ointment formulation (4 microg/g) once daily. A psoriatic lesion was selected in each patient in order to assess clinical symptoms (erythema, desquamation and thickness) by means of five-point scale: 0 (none) to 4 (maximal severity). Percentages of involved skin, adverse effects, physicians' global assessments of efficacy and tolerability, and patients' global satisfaction scores were also evaluated after 15-30 days (first visit) and 2 months (second visit) of treatment. RESULTS: A total of 556 patients were included. Mean psoriasis duration was 10.1 years (range, 0-61 years). Follow-up data were available for 493 patients in first follow-up visit and 449 in second (final) visit. Adverse events were uncommon (1.0% and 0.6% of patients in first and second follow-up visits, respectively). At first follow-up visit, mean decrease in selected lesions surface area (from a baseline value of 185.8 cm(2) per lesion) was 11.1 cm(2) (95% CI, 1.6-20.6; P = 0.0213). After 2 months of treatment, mean scores for erythema, desquamation and thickness changed from 2.2 +/- 0.8 to 1.1 +/- 0.8 (19% of patients with no erythema at final visit); from 2.4 +/- 0.8 to 0.6 +/- 0.7 (55% of patients with no desquamation); and from 2.2 +/- 0.9 to 0.8 +/- 0.6 (51% of patients with less thickness), respectively. Mean percentage of total body skin involvement was 14% (7.5% and 6.9% of anterior and posterior body surface, respectively). After 2 months of treatment, a 3.2% (95% CI, 2.7-3.8; P = 0.0001) and 3.0% (95% CI, 2.4-3.6; P = 0.0001) decrease was observed in the percentage of involved anterior and posterior skin surface area, respectively. Efficacy and tolerability evaluation by investigators was very good or good in 94% and 74% of patients, respectively; 78% of patients evaluated study treatment as satisfactory/very satisfactory. More than 80%, 50-80% and less than 50% of prescribed doses were used by 88%, 9.3% and 2.3% of patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Tacalcitol was highly effective in the symptomatic treatment of moderate psoriasis. Compliance was very high, probably due to the easy and convenient application. Physicians' global assessments of tacalcitol were excellent, both for tolerability and efficacy. Excellent tolerability was confirmed by the low rate of adverse events. Our results in an everyday clinical setting show that tacalcitol is a useful therapy in patients with moderate psoriasis. "
"Abstract: Tattooing is a popular cosmetic practice involving more than 45 million US citizens. Since the toxicology of tattoo inks and pigments used to formulate tattoo inks has not been reported, we studied the immunological impact of tattooing and determined recovery time from this trauma. SKH-1 hairless mice were tattooed using commercial tattoo inks or suspensions of titanium dioxide, cadmium sulfide, or iron oxide, and sacrificed at 0.5, 1, 3, 4, 7, or 14 days post-tattooing. Histological evaluation revealed dermal hemorrhage at 0.5 and 1 day. Acute inflammation and epidermal necrosis were initiated at 0.5 day decreasing in incidence by day 14. Dermal necrosis and epidermal hyperplasia were prominent by day 3, reducing in severity by day 14. Chronic active inflammation persisted in all tattooed mice from day 3 to 14 post-tattooing. Inguinal and axillary lymph nodes were pigmented, the inguinal being most reactive as evidenced by lymphoid hyperplasia and polymorphonuclear infiltration. Cutaneous nuclear protein concentrations of nuclear factor-kappa B were elevated between 0.5 and 4 days. Inflammatory and proliferative biomarkers, cyclooxygenase-1, cyclooxygenase-2, and ornithine decarboxylase protein levels were elevated between 0.5 and 4 days in the skin and decreased to control levels by day 14. Interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-10 were elevated in the lymph nodes but suppressed in the tattooed skin, with maximal suppression occurring between days 0.5 and 4. These data demonstrate that mice substantially recover from the tattooing insult by 14 days, leaving behind pigment in the dermis and the regional lymph nodes. The response seen in mice is similar to acute injury seen in humans, suggesting that the murine model might be a suitable surrogate for investigating the toxicological and phototoxicological properties of ingredients used in tattooing.

"Abstract: The objective of this study was to design an all-trans retinoic acid (RA) topical release system that modifies drug diffusion parameters in the vehicle and the skin in order to reduce systemic absorption and the side-effects associated with topical application of the drug to skin. Three cases of application of hydrogels containing RA either in free form or encapsulated in stratum corneum lipid liposomes (SCLLs) have been considered. For this purpose, we have evaluated the RA in formulations with combinations of Carbopol Ultrez 10 (U10) and hyaluronic acid (HA) for percutaneous absorption. In vitro permeability experiments with [3H]-t-RA were carried out using a Franz-type diffusion cell in abdominal rat skin samples. Accumulation of the drug in the surface and skin layers was evaluated by both the tape stripping method and a dissection technique, and subsequently, all the radiolabelled samples were analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. The results show that RA encapsulation not only prolongs drug release but also promotes drug retention by the viable skin. At the same time, interaction between RA and HA has an obstructive effect on diffusion, which contributes to the formation of a reservoir of the latter. "
"Abstract: Increased risk of cardiovascular disease contributes significantly to the higher rate of mortality seen in kidney transplant patients compared to the general population. New-onset diabetes mellitus (NODM) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, as well as being associated with significantly increased graft loss and higher health care costs compared to the nondiabetic transplant population. Evidence from large-scale analyses of registry databases has shown that the calcineurin inhibitor, tacrolimus, is associated with approximately a 50% increase in the risk of NODM compared to the microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine (CsA); but to date, little robust evidence is available from clinical trials. The DIRECT (Diabetes Incidence after REnal transplantation: Neoral C2 monitoring versus Tacrolimus) study will be the first prospective trial to compare directly the impact of tacrolimus and CsA microemulsion on glucose metabolism in kidney transplant recipients. DIRECT is a 6-month, parallel-group, open-label, randomized trial for which approximately 700 patients will be recruited at around 70 transplant centers worldwide. Patients will be randomized to tacrolimus or CsA microemulsion (using C2 monitoring), with mycophenolate mofetil or enteric-coated mycophenolic acid, steroids, and basiliximab. Primary endpoints are: (a) a composite of NODM or impaired fasting glucose among patients who are nondiabetic at time of transplantation; and (b) combined incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection, graft loss, or death with CsA microemulsion C2 monitoring compared to tacrolimus trough monitoring . Full results are expected in 2006, with interim results available by the end of 2004, and will be awaited with interest by the transplant community. "
"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy of infiltrated local anesthesia with topical anesthesia for repair of dermal laceration, to analyze the efficacy of single or multicomponent topical anesthetics, and to identify topical formulations that are potentially less costly and equally efficacious as cocaine-containing topical anesthetics. DESIGN: Systematic review of randomized controlled trials. SETTING: University-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Pediatric and adult subjects. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-two trials that randomized more than 3000 patients were identified. The majority of studies demonstrated equivalent or superior analgesic efficacy for topical formulations compared with conventional intradermal infiltration. We found that cocaine is not a mandatory component of topical anesthesia. The literature discloses no significant difference in anesthetic efficacy between topical tetracaine-epinephrine-cocaine and each of the following 6 cocaine-free formulations: lidocaine-epinephrine-tetracaine, lidocaine-epinephrine, tetracaine-phenylephrine, tetracaine-lidocaine-phenylephrine, bupivicaine-norepinephrine, or prilocaine-phenylephrine. CONCLUSION: Topical anesthetics are an efficacious, noninvasive means of providing analgesia before suturing of dermal lacerations. The use of cocaine-containing topical anesthetics can no longer be justified in light of its high cost and potential adverse effects. We have summarized the evidence, mostly favorable, supporting the use of various non-cocaine-containing topical anesthetics. "
"Abstract: Orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) of ondansetron is a new formulation, which instantaneously disintegrates and disperses in the saliva without need for ingestion of a liquid. This makes the formulation suitable for administration in children. The objective of this study was to compare the relative efficacy and cost of ODT and intravenous (IV) formulation of ondansetron in controlling nausea and vomiting in children receiving chemotherapy regimens without cisplatin. This prospective randomized trial was performed in a single institution to compare ODT and IV formulation of ondansetron for the prevention of acute emesis in a group of 22 children. Study agents were administered 30 min before chemotherapy and 12 hourly after chemotherapy (5 mg/m2 IV or 4-8 mg oral according to body surface area in 56 and 39 courses, respectively). After randomization, IV formulation was administered to some children instead of ODT due to unavailability of this formulation. Complete and major control of emesis was obtained in 92% of patients in the IV group and 93% of patients in the ODT group. In 56 courses with grade III-IV emetogenicity, complete response rates were not different between the two treatment arms. In the courses without corticosteroids complete response rates were not also different between the two arms. The mean costs per successfully controlled courses were 121.3 USD for the IV formulation whereas 63.2 USD for the ODT formulation. The results of this study confirmed that ODT formulation of ondansetron is a safe, well-tolerated, and cost-effective antiemetic for children during non-cisplatin-containing moderately and highly emetogenic chemotherapy. "
"Abstract: In this work, the estrogenic effects of three classes of substances included in cosmetic formulations-parabens, ultraviolet (UV) screens, and musk fragrances-were studied. Their estrogenic activity was measured with the use of three reporter cell lines: HELN, HELN ERalpha, and HELN ERbeta. These three cell lines allowed for the measurement of estrogenic activity toward estrogen receptors alpha and beta (ERalpha and ERbeta, while taking nonspecific interactions into account. Eight of the 15 substances tested showed specific estrogenic activity with the following degree of potency on ERalpha butylparaben > propylparaben > homosalate = octyl-dimethyl-PABA = 4-methyl-benzylidenecamphor = octyl-methoxycinnamate > ethylparaben = galaxolide. Among these active substances, parabens activated ERalpha and ERbeta similarly, UV screens activated ERalpha moderately and had almost no effect on ERbeta, and fragrances did not activate ERbeta. Methylparaben, ethylparaben, musk moskene, celestolide, and cashmeran did not activate estrogenic responses up to 10(-5) M. Musk ketone and benzophenone-3 were not considered estrogenic at 10(-5) M. "
"Abstract: Vesiculo-erosive diseases of the oral mucosa pose a major challenge in oral medicine, because they are chronic, painful, and interfere with the daily activities and quality of life of the patients, including disturbing eating, drinking, talking, and personal relationships. Many are autoimmune diseases, and corticosteroid therapy is currently central to their treatment. These diseases present with inflammation and alterations to epithelial integrity, through cell and/or humoral immunity-mediated attack on epithelial-connective tissue targets. Until recently, despite their serious adverse effects, it was necessary to prescribe systemic corticosteroids to control severe erosive oral diseases. Now, however, many of these diseases can be controlled by high-potency topical corticosteroids, which have proved to be highly efficacious and to cause fewer adverse effects compared with systemic corticosteroids. Nevertheless, although topical corticosteroids are still the most widely used drugs in the practice of oral medicine, the scientific body of evidence for their use in the oral cavity is virtually non-existent, and therefore many of the protocols followed are, of necessity, drawn from experience of their use in a dermatological setting. This review aims to set out the key aspects of the use of topical corticosteroids in oral medicine. The issues covered include the indications and basic rules for their use, the types of corticosteroids, the drug selection, and the specific formulations. "
"Abstract: Sunscreens are used to protect the skin from harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) light but they do not completely prevent photocarcinogenesis, photoaging and photoimmunosuppression. They are useful for protection against UVB and short-wave UVA. Complete protection against long-wave UVA has not been achieved. There is no universally accepted method to evaluate UVA protection. Sun protection factor is a simple and internationally used method to compare sunscreen protection against UVB induced erythema. Adverse reactions to sunscreens are not common but they should be considered especially in persons with pre-existing eczematous conditions or photodermatoses. The use of sunscreens has increased steadily over the last decade; as a result, allergy and photoallergy to UV filters are now more frequent than in the past. Sensitization can occur from the various sunscreening agents and from the excipients included in formulations. An overview of sunscreens, their effectiveness, and adverse reactions is presented. "
"Abstract: The photodegradation of retinoic acids, tretinoin and isotretinoin, in ethanol and liposomes was studied. The light irradiation was performed according to the conditions suggested by the ICH Guideline for photostability testing by using a Xenon lamp within a wavelength range of 300-800 nm. The photodegradation process was monitored by UV spectrophotometry. In ethanol solution, tretinoin and isotretinoin undergo complete isomerization just within a few seconds of light exposure to give 13-cis and 9-cis isomers, respectively. The 13-cis isomer from tretinoin undergoes in turn a slow isomerization to the same 9-cis isomer. Both retinoic acids incorporated in liposome complexes showed an increased stability in comparison to the ethanol solutions. In particular for tretinoin, a residual concentration of 60% was still present after a light irradiance of 3470 kJ/m(2), by means of a 250 W/m(2) light power for 240 min, versus a residual value of just 8% measured at the same time in ethanol solution. Moreover, the isomerization rate in liposomes resulted reduced for isotretinoin and practically irrelevant for tretinoin. The degradation rate was found to be dependent on the drug concentration. The better stability of the tretinoin in liposome complex was supposed to be related to its higher incorporation value due to the linear structure of the molecule. "
"Abstract: Investigations on the stratum corneum (SC) reservoir for topically applied substances are of importance in dermatologic science in order to assess the pharmacokinetics of these substances. In the present study, an in vivo method was developed to determine the SC reservoir quantitatively and to investigate the temporal behavior of this reservoir. Therefore, increasing amounts of an oil-in-water emulsion (o/w emulsion) containing 4% of a chemical UV filter were topically applied onto the flexor forearms of 5 healthy volunteers. The saturation of the SC reservoir was determined utilizing the tape stripping technique 1 and 6 h after application. The capacity of the SC reservoir for the o/w emulsion was found to be approximately 2.7 mg/cm(2). Furthermore, a correlation of the capacity of the SC with transepidermal water loss was observed. Extending the time between the topical application and SC removal did not affect the distribution or the recovery rate of the UV filter in the SC. The results indicate that the reservoir of the SC is limited. This is reflected by the saturation level, which depends on the individual volunteer and, presumably, the topically applied substances and formulations used. The results show that the method developed is suited to quantitatively determine in vivo the SC reservoir for topically applied substances. "
"BACKGROUND: Chlorhexidine (CHX) 0.2% solution is still ""the leading oral antiseptic"" for controlling gingivitis. Side effects, however, limit the acceptability to users and the long-term employment of a 0.2% CHX antiseptic in preventive dentistry. This stimulated the development of new formulations. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect on plaque inhibition and taste perception of two commercially available mouthrinses (0.12% CHX non-alcohol base with 0.05% cetyl pyridinium chloride (Cpc) versus 0.2% CHX alcohol base). METHODS: The study was designed as a single-blind, randomized two group parallel experiment, to compare two different commercially available mouthrinses, during a 3-day plaque accumulation model. Forty healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study and received a thorough dental prophylaxis at the beginning of the test period. Over a 72-h experimental non-brushing period, during which subjects abstained from all forms of mechanical oral hygiene, one group (test) used a 15 ml alcohol free 0.12% CHX (=18 mg) mouthrinse on a Cpc base (Perioaid), CHX plus sign in circleCpc), twice daily for 30 s. The other group (control) used a 10 ml 0.2% CHX (=20 mg) mouthrinse on an 11.8% ethanol alcohol base (Corsodyl), CHX plus sign in circleAlc), twice daily for 60 s. After 72 h of plaque formation, the amount of plaque was evaluated. By the use of visual analogue scale, the subjects were asked for their appreciation of the taste of the mouthrinse they had used. RESULTS: The mean plaque index for the CHX plus sign in circleCpc group was 0.97 and for the CHX plus sign in circleAlc group 0.78. After 72 h of non-brushing, there was no significant difference in plaque accumulation between the two groups. The answers to the questions (taste perception and after-taste) showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups. The mean visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for taste appreciation on a scale from very bad to very good taste (0-10) were 5.92 for the CHX plus sign in circleCpc group and 4.10 for the CHX plus sign in circleAlc group (p=0.02). The mean visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for the after-taste on a scale from very short to very long (0-10) were 7.24 for the CHX plus sign in circleCpc group and 5.38 for the CHX plus sign in circleAlc group. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of the present study design, it can be concluded that rinsing with a 0.12% CHX mouthrinse on a non-alcohol base with 0.05% Cpc (Perio-Aid) is not significantly different from rinsing with a 0.2% CHX mouthrinse on an alcohol base (Corsodyl). It appears that the subjects appreciated the taste of the non-alcohol CHX solution better but the after-taste of the rinse remained longer in the mouth. "
"Abstract: Retinoids target several pathoetiologic events of acne vulgaris. The undisputed efficacy of tretinoin, and yet its underutilization, due to apprehension of retinoid dermatitis, triggered a search for newer, well-tolerated retinoids. The discovery of nuclear retinoic acid receptors has provided clues to a rational design of synthetic, receptor-selective retinoic acid agonists. Adapalene is an addition to the arsenal of topical retinoids. It possesses the biological properties of tretinoin, but has a distinct physiochemical profile, including high lipophilicity and increased chemical and photostability. It exhibits selective affinity for nuclear retinoic acid receptors and does not bind to cytosolic retinoic acid binding proteins. It exemplifies the formulation of a novel retinoid with specific pharmacologic profile and clinical objectives. Accordingly, numerous clinical trials have compared adapalene and tretinoin in the management of acne vulgaris and concluded that tretinoin 0.05% gel exhibits a greater anti-acne efficacy than adapalene 0.1% gel, but has higher skin irritation potential. This article reviews the pharmacology of adapalene, including its retinoid receptor binding profile, antiproliferative effects, cell differentiation modulation, comedolytic and anti-inflammatory activity, and specifically focuses on the comparison of the efficacy and irritation profile of adapalene and tretinoin.

"OBJECTIVE: Oral care products deliver breath freshening primarily via mechano-chemical cleaning or by antimicrobial active systems. Dental flavours provide taste benefits, and freshen breath mainly by sensorial masking. We aimed to determine whether flavours could deliver breath freshening in products by inhibiting bacterial volatile sulphide compound (VSC) production. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Flavour materials were screened for inhibition of hydrogen sulphide formation by Klebsiella pneumoniae in vitro, grouped by efficacy, and data provided to flavourists. Flavours were formulated to maximize the content of VSC-effective ingredients and re-screened to confirm performance. Extensive, iterative testing of flavours identified reliable creative rules to deliver efficient inhibition of H2S generation. Breath-freshening flavours in whole products were then tested in-house in a 'breath freshness panel'. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Malodour of panellists (not preselected for malodour score) was scored before and after product use, on the 'Rosenberg' 0-5 scale, together with residual flavour score, by extensively trained judges. Products were tested in double-blind, crossover studies, and results analysed using ANOVA. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Products flavoured using these rules delivered significantly greater breath freshening at 2 h than control products, and equivalent benefits to products containing 0.1% (w/w) triclosan or 0.2% (w/w) zinc sulphate.

"Abstract: A 53-year-old man with Behçet disease was treated with conventional cyclosporin A (CyA), because of refractory bilateral uveitis. Immediately following the conversion from conventional CyA to a microemulsion formulation, he presented with neurological complications. The neurological findings, pleocytosis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brainstem lesions revealed by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested neuro-Behçet disease. After discontinuing CyA and introducing oral prednisolone, the neurological symptoms, pleocytosis of CSF and brainstem lesions on MRI improved. Although the microemulsion formulation, which can maintain a stable level of blood CyA, is a useful agent for the control of ocular lesions in Behçet disease, the resulting abrupt increase in blood CyA level may have induced neuro-Behçet disease.

"Abstract: In order to demonstrate the importance of photoprotection in the UVA range (320-400 nm), an in vitro approach where sun formulations are spread on a quartz slide, and placed over human keratinocytes in culture is proposed as a convenient test for photoprotection assessment at the DNA level. Using the comet assay, DNA strand breaks, oxidative DNA damage or drug-induced DNA breaks were assessed. Accumulation of p53 protein was also studied as a marker for UV-induced genotoxic stress. Such a method was used to compare two formulations with different photostability. Spectroradiometry showed that a photounstable formulation lost its effectiveness in UVA screening when pre-irradiated by simulated sunlight (UVB+UVA). As a consequence, it was also shown that this formulation was not as protective as the photostable one at the genomic level. These data demonstrate that the loss of absorbing efficiency within UVA wavelengths due to photounstability may have detrimental consequences leading to impairments implicated in genotoxic events. "
"Abstract: This paper presents our experience to date with using a cyclosporine formulation Equoral (IVAX Pharmaceuticals) together with mycophenolate mofetil plus a steroid immunosuppressive regimen in the treatment of de novo renal transplant recipients. Ten cadaveric donor renal transplant recipients of mean age 51.6 years (range 37-66) were followed up over 6 months for the development of rejection attacks and side effects. All patients received prednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil (1 g/day during the first 5 days posttransplant and then 20 mg/kg/day) plus cyclosporine (3 mg/kg/day). Biopsy proven acute rejection episodes were observed in 2 out of 10 patients (20%). Six months patient as well as renal graft survival rate was 100%. The development of graft function was immediate after transplantation. The mean serum creatinine levels were gradually decreased. Over the 6-month posttransplant period, the function of the graft was satisfactory and stable. The majority of observed adverse events were those commonly reported with the use of cyclosporine and they resolved with a reduction in cyclosporine dose. Equoral treatment demonstrated an acceptable safety profile with maintenance of adequate renal function without incidence of malignancy/lymphoproliferative disease or serious infections. In conclusion, Equoral plus mycophenolate mofetil immunosuppression seems effective and safe on terms acute rejection rates, patient and renal graft survival rates and side profiles. "
"Abstract: Mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active moiety of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), is routinely used as an adjunct immunosuppressant therapy in renal transplantation. Although highly effective, MMF therapy is associated with significant gastrointestinal adverse effects. Enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) is an advanced formulation delivering MPA. The enteric coat dissolves at pH > 5 allowing for MPA delivery in the small intestine. A single-center, open-label, randomized, three-way crossover study of 24 stable Caucasian renal transplant patients receiving cyclosporine-based immunosuppression, compared the relative bioavailability of two EC-MPS doses (640 and 720 mg) with MMF (1000 mg). Both EC-MPS doses delivered bioequivalent mean MPA exposure (AUC(0-infinity)) compared with 1000 mg MMF: 60.7 microg h/mL for 640 mg EC-MPS, 66.5 microg h/mL for 720 mg EC-MPS, and 63.7 microg h/mL for 1000 mg MMF. Median t(max) was significantly delayed for both EC-MPS doses compared with MMF (2.0 h vs. 0.75 h, respectively; p < 0.01), consistent with a functional enteric coating of EC-MPS. Furthermore, both EC-MPS doses were bioequivalent to 1000 mg MMF for AUC and C(max) for mycophenolic acid glucuronide. All three treatments were well tolerated. The EC-MPS 720 mg dose most closely approximated the MPA exposure of 1000 mg MMF and was selected for subsequent phase III studies. "
"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial agents such as stannous fluoride and triclosan have been incorporated into dentifrice formulations and have been shown to be effective in reducing gingivitis. The objective of this study was to compare the anti-gingivitis efficacy of a 0.454% stannous fluoride/sodium hexametaphosphate dentifrice to a positive control triclosan/copolymer dentifrice. METHODS: This was a 6-month, randomized, double-masked, parallel-group study conducted according to the American Dental Association guidelines for evaluating chemotherapeutic products for the control of gingivitis. A 0.454% stannous fluoride/sodium hexametaphosphate dentifrice was tested against a commercially available positive control dentifrice (0.30% triclosan/2.0% Gantrez copolymer). Following baseline measurements, subjects received a dental prophylaxis. Subjects were then instructed to brush twice daily for 60 seconds using their assigned product. Tooth brushing was supervised for 3 days of each week. Clinical examinations using a gingival index were performed at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: A total of 199 subjects were enrolled and 186 completed the 6-month study. Average baseline gingivitis and bleeding scores were similar for the two treatment groups. After 6 months, the experimental group had statistically significantly less gingivitis (25.8%) and statistically significantly less bleeding (27.4%) on average compared to the control group. Neither adverse oral soft tissue effects nor tooth staining were reported. CONCLUSION: Within the limits of the study protocol, the results demonstrated superior therapeutic benefits for the stabilized 0.454% stannous fluoride/sodium hexametaphosphate dentifrice in reducing gingivitis compared to the triclosan/copolymer control in this partially supervised study.

"OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and tolerability of topical pimecrolimus and tacrolimus compared with other treatments for atopic dermatitis. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Electronic searches of the Cochrane Library, Medline, and Embase. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials of topical pimecrolimus or tacrolimus reporting efficacy outcomes or tolerability. EFFICACY: investigators' global assessment of response; patients' global assessment of response; proportions of patients with flares of atopic dermatitis; and improvements in quality of life. Tolerability: overall rates of withdrawal; withdrawal due to adverse events; and proportions of patients with burning of the skin and skin infections. DATA SYNTHESIS: 4186 of 6897 participants in 25 randomised controlled trials received pimecrolimus or tacrolimus. Both drugs were significantly more effective than a vehicle control. Tacrolimus 0.1% was as effective as potent topical corticosteroids at three weeks and more effective than combined treatment with hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1% (potent used on trunk) plus hydrocortisone acetate 1% (weak used on face) at 12 weeks (number needed to treat (NNT) = 6). Tacrolimus 0.1% was also more effective than hydrocortisone acetate 1% (NNT = 4). In comparison, tacrolimus 0.03% was more effective than hydrocortisone acetate 1% (NNT = 5) but less effective than hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1% (NNT = -8). Direct comparisons of tacrolimus 0.03% and tacrolimus 0.1% consistently favoured the higher strength formulation, but efficacy differed significantly between the two strengths only after 12 weeks' treatment (rate ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 0.99). Pimecrolimus was far less effective than betamethasone valerate 0.1% (NNT = -3 at three weeks). Pimecrolimus and tacrolimus caused significantly more skin burning than topical corticosteroids. Rates of skin infections in any of the comparisons did not differ. CONCLUSIONS: Both topical pimecrolimus and topical tacrolimus are more effective than placebo treatments for atopic dermatitis, but in the absence of studies that show long term safety gains, any advantage over topical corticosteroids is unclear. Topical tacrolimus is similar to potent topical corticosteroids and may have a place for long term use in patients with resistant atopic dermatitis on sites where side effects from topical corticosteroids might develop quickly. In the absence of key comparisons with mild corticosteroids, the clinical need for topical pimecrolimus is unclear. The usefulness of either treatment in patients who have failed to respond adequately to topical corticosteroids is also unclear. "
"Abstract: Sunlight may decompose active substances and excipients in pharmaceuticals. This may cause formulation problems as well as induce adverse skin reactions. The photodecomposition of topical preparations may occur on the skin surface, but also deeper in the skin after penetration of light into the viable tissues. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether microparticles of titanium dioxide could protect against photodecomposition using ketoprofen as a photolabile model substance. The results showed quality differences between titanium dioxide, where surface-coated particles were superior to pharmaceutical grades in reducing the degradation in vitro. The protective effect was also studied in humans. The skin was treated for 3 h with the gels and then exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light (11.7 J/cm2 UVA and 5.4 mJ/cm2 UVB). Layers of the stratum corneum were then removed by consecutive tape strippings and assayed for content of ketoprofen. The remaining amount was higher in the different stratum corneum compartments after treatment with a gel containing 4% coated titanium dioxide compared with a transparent gel. Thus, surface-coated microparticles of titanium dioxide may well be of clinical benefit in protecting photolabile drug substances against sunlight. "
"BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory allergic disease of children. The primary anti-inflammatory therapy is topical steroids. An effective treatment without the topical and systemic adverse effects of corticosteroids would be useful. Topical formulations of sodium cromoglicate have been researched in the past, but without consistent results. We report a trial of a new aqueous skin lotion of sodium cromoglicate (Altoderm) in children with AD. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy, safety and acceptability of Altoderm lotion with a placebo control in the treatment of AD in children. METHODS: A double-blind, controlled study in which children aged 2-12 years with AD were randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with a lotion containing 4% sodium cromoglicate (Altoderm) or the lotion base. To be included subjects had to have a SCORAD score of > or = 25 and < or = 60 at both of two clinic visits 14 days apart. Subjects continued using existing treatment which included emollients and topical steroids. The primary outcome was the change in the SCORAD score. The two groups were compared for the change in the SCORAD score from the second baseline visit to the visit after 12 weeks of treatment using an analysis of variance. Secondary outcome measures included parents' assessment of symptoms, usage of topical steroids recorded on daily diary cards, and final opinions of treatment by parent and clinician. Parents were asked about adverse effects at each clinic visit and the responses recorded. RESULTS: Fifty-eight children were randomized to Altoderm and 56 to placebo and all were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The mean +/- SD SCORAD scores at baseline were 41.0 +/- 9.0 (Altoderm) and 40.4 +/- 8.73 (placebo). These scores were reduced after 12 weeks by 13.2 (36%) with Altoderm and by 7.6 (20%) with placebo. The difference of 5.6 (95% confidence interval 1.0-10.3) is statistically significant (P = 0.018). Diary card symptoms improved with both treatments but the improvement was greater in the Altoderm-treated patients. Topical steroid usage was reduced in both groups and was larger in the Altoderm-treated patients. The differences were statistically significant for the mean of all symptoms, the overall skin condition and use of topical steroids. Those for itching and sleep loss were not. Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 11 subjects (Altoderm seven, placebo four). Most of these referred to irritation, redness and burning at the site of application. There were four reports of erythema and pruritus (Altoderm three, placebo one), and three reports of application site burning (Altoderm two, placebo one). None was reported as severe or very severe. CONCLUSIONS: These results show a clinically useful benefit of this sodium cromoglicate lotion in children with moderately severe AD. "
"Abstract: Mustard, a vesicant warfare agent, has cytotoxic, mutagenic, and cytostatic effects via alkylation of DNA and inhibition of DNA replication. Since symptoms appear following a latent period, it can cause some subacute and chronic effects to occur and delay in the treatment. Therefore, the main approach should be the use of protective preparation to reduce the skin toxicity. Thus, this study was conducted in guinea pigs (350-400 g) shaved in areas of 10 x 10 cm. Mechlorethamine HCl (100 mg), a nitrogen mustard derivative, in ethanol was applied by spraying on hairless regions where previously prepared pharmaceutical topical formulations were medicated before. The experimental regions of the animals were kept preserved from environmental factors. Forty-eight hours after the application of the protective ointments and mechlorethamine consecutively, skin-damaging effects were macroscopically evaluated in terms of erythema formation, ulceration, necrosis, and inflammation occurrences. Then, punch biopsy was performed from these damaged sites for histopathological evaluation. Although numerous topical formulations were prepared and tested for protection, according to microscopic examination of the pathologic sections, tissue specimen treated with the ointment containing the mixture of zinc oxide, zinc chloride, dimethylpolysiloxane in a base of petroleum jelly was determined as being the most effective protective against skin injury caused by the vesicant agent. "
"BACKGROUND: Retinoids and alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) are major compounds in topical therapy. They exert distinct but potentially complementary activities. However, their association is limited by their respective irritating potential. Recently, the first association between a retinoid and an AHA has been achieved; this formulation (RALGA) associates retinaldehyde (RAL)--a precursor of retinoic acid (RA)--and glycolic acid (GA)--an AHA. OBJECTIVE: To study the pharmacological properties of RALGA. METHODS: The bioavailability of RAL into the skin after topical RALGA was studied by HPLC, and its bioconversion to RA was analysed by measuring the enzyme activity of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase and the RA content in the epidermis and dermis. The retinoid activity of RALGA was studied on the modulation of Hhb4 keratin mRNA on the tail of C57BL/6 mice, and its comedolytic properties on the size and density of dermal cysts and the morphology of sebaceous glands in hairless mice. RESULTS: Epidermal and dermal concentrations of RAL and RA were higher after RALGA treatment, as compared to both RAL 0.1% alone and RA 0.05% alone; this indicates that the presence of GA favours the bioavailability and biotransformation of RAL into RA. The retinoid activity of RALGA (suppression of Hhb4 mRNA keratin) was similar to that of RAL alone, indicating that the presence of GA does not interfere with specific retinoid activity; GA alone had no effect in this test, which confirms the specificity of Hhb4 mRNA keratin modulation for retinoid activity. The diameter and the density of dermal cysts as well as the size of sebaceous glands were significantly decreased by RALGA. CONCLUSION: These observations indicate that the addition of an AHA such as GA to a retinoid such as RAL results in a better bioavailability of the retinoid, thus a higher delivery of RA, which potentiates the biological activities of the retinoid. This combination allows a delivery of high amounts of RA in the skin while preventing the side-effects usually observed with high concentrations of topical RA. "
"Abstract: Alcohol-based products for skin antisepsis have a long history of safety and efficacy in the United States and abroad. However, alcohol alone lacks the required antimicrobial persistence to provide for the sustained periods of skin antisepsis desired in the clinical environment. Therefore, alcohol-based products must have a preservative agent such as iodine/iodophor compounds, chlorhexidine gluconate, or zinc pyrithione, to extend its antimicrobial effects. Iodine, iodophors, and chlorhexidine gluconate are well-characterized antimicrobials and preservatives. The thrust of our effort was to examine the characteristics of the lesser-known zinc pyrithione and to evaluate its utility as a preservative in the formulation of alcohol-based products for skin antisepsis. This work includes a literature review of current zinc pyrithione applications in drugs and cosmetics, a safety and toxicity evaluation, consideration of the proposed mechanisms of antimicrobial action, in vitro and in vivo efficacy data, and a discussion of the mechanisms that confer the desired antimicrobial persistence. In addition, alcohol-based, zinc pyrithione-preserved, commercially available products of skin antisepsis are compared with other commercially available antimicrobials used for skin antisepsis and with additional alcohol-based products with different preservatives. The authors' conclusion is that zinc pyrithione is not only a safe and effective antimicrobial but that its use in certain alcohol-based formulations results in antimicrobial efficacy exceeding that of iodine and chlorhexidine gluconate.

"PURPOSE: To develop a local drug delivery system that provides therapeutic cyclosporine levels to treat lacrimal gland graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. METHODS: Episcleral cyclosporine implants were manufactured with a silicone-based matrix design, and in vitro release rates were determined. Preclinical evaluation included toxicology (clinical examination, serial electroretinography, and histopathology) in normal rabbits and dogs, pharmacokinetics in normal rabbits, and pharmacodynamics in a canine model of aqueous tear deficiency and keratoconjunctivitis sicca. RESULTS: The cyclosporine implants showed sustained release of drug over time with in vitro assays. Histopathology showed normal ocular tissues in both dogs and rabbits 6 months after implantation. The cyclosporine implant produced lacrimal gland drug levels 1 to 2 log units higher than those reported with a variety of topical cyclosporine formulations and oral administration. The cyclosporine implant was effective in a canine model of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, with all animals able to discontinue topical cyclosporine and maintain normal Schirmer scores over a 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This preclinical evaluation showed that the episcleral cyclosporine implant was safe, delivered potentially therapeutic cyclosporine levels to the lacrimal gland, and showed efficacy in a clinically relevant model of keratoconjunctivitis sicca. The episcleral cyclosporine implant shows promise in reducing the morbidity associated with lacrimal gland graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In addition, continuous release of cyclosporine in the subconjunctival space with the episcleral implant was an effective means of delivering drug to the ocular surface and may have potential in treating other ocular inflammatory diseases.

"BACKGROUND: Topical retinoids are one of the most effective classes of topical drugs used to treat acne vulgaris. The effects of the gel formulation of the topical retinoid tazarotene have been widely reported, but few data on the cream formulation are available. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of the 2 studies reported in this article was to determine the effects of tazarotene 0.1 % cream in patients with facial acne vulgaris. METHODS: Two randomized, double-blind, parallel-group studies were performed. The first was conducted at 14 investigational sites across the United States, and the second took place at 15 sites, with 5 of these providing blood samples for analysis of tazarotenic acid. In both studies, patients aged > or =12 years with facial acne vulgaris were randomized to receive tazarotene or vehicle cream QD for 12 weeks. Lesion counts (noninflammatory, inflammatory, and total) and overall clinical and global assessments were made at weeks 0 (baseline), 4, 8, and 12. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout the study In one of the studies, therapeutic drug monitoring was performed at weeks 4 and 8 in members of the study population who gave consent for blood withdrawal. RESULTS: Eight hundred forty-seven patients were enrolled in the 2 studies (430 males, 417 females; mean age,19 years; age range, 11-52 years [1 patient was entered into the study at age 11 years, in violation of the protocol]). At 12 weeks, the median percentage changes from baseline in all 3 lesion counts were significantly lower with tazarotene than with vehicle (all, P < 0.001), as were the overall clinical and global responses (both, P < 0.001). Treatment-related AEs whose incidence was higher with tazarotene than with vehicle included desquamation, dry skin, erythema, a burning sensation on the skin, and skin irritation (all, P < 0.001) and pruritus (P < 0.01); most (83%-98%) were mild or moderate. Systemic exposure to tazarotenic acid was limited (mean, <0.1 ng/mL) and did not increase with time. CONCLUSIONS: In these 2 studies in adolescent and adult patients with facial acne vulgaris, tazarotene 0.1%cream QD for 12 weeks was effective and well tolerated. Systemic exposure to tazarotenic acid was limited. "
"Abstract: After the introduction of cyclosporine into liver transplantation in 1983, 1-year patient survival more than doubled. Later, with the improved microemulsified formulation of cyclosporine (Neoral) more stable pharmacokinetics were achieved. Today, C(2) monitoring of cyclosporine blood levels allows a more accurate estimation of the area under the concentration-versus-time curve as the single best indicator of cyclosporine exposure. As a consequence, with better control of side effects as well as desired effects the results of cyclosporine in liver transplantation have been further improved. The introduction of mycophenolate mofetil and basiliximab/daclizumab combination therapy has provided new options for the prevention of allograft rejection. The safety profile of individual immunosuppressive regimens comes more into focus since acute allograft rejection may be controlled successfully with competing strategies. As the focus in liver transplantation is shifting toward greatly improved long-term results, late posttransplant mortality with a functioning graft is a major concern. Prevention of long-term complications associated with highly effective immunosuppressants--posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease, cytomegalovirus infection, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia-gains importance. Technical advances in living-related and cadaveric split-liver transplantation have lead to increasing use of segmental liver transplantation with the need to consider the effects of immunosuppression on liver regeneration and metabolism. The individualized orchestration of immunosuppression taking into account the underlying liver disease as well as other individual predispositions remains a future challenge. "
"BACKGROUND: We investigated the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of five antimicrobial regimens for mild to moderate facial acne and whether propionibacterial antibiotic resistance affects treatment response. METHODS: In this randomised, observer-masked trial, 649 community participants were allocated one of five antibacterial regimens. Primary outcomes were patients' self-assessed improvement and reduction in inflamed lesions at 18 weeks. Analyses were by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Moderate or greater improvement at 18 weeks was reported in 72 (55%) of 131 participants assigned oral oxytetracycline plus topical placebo, 70 (54%) of 130 assigned oral minocycline plus topical placebo, 78 (60%) of 130 assigned topical benzoyl peroxide plus oral placebo, 84 (66%) of 127 assigned topical erythromycin and benzoyl peroxide in a combined formulation plus oral placebo, and 82 (63%) of 131 assigned topical erythromycin and benzoyl peroxide separately plus oral placebo. Most improvement occurred in the first 6 weeks. Treatment differences for the proportion of people with at least moderate improvement were: minocycline versus oxytetracycline -1.2% (unadjusted 95% CI -13.3 to 10.9); combined erythromycin and benzoyl peroxide versus oxytetracycline 11.1% (-0.7 to 22.9) and versus minocycline 12.3% (0.4 to 24.2); erythromycin and benzoyl peroxide separately versus combined formulation -3.5% (-15.2 to 8.2); benzoyl peroxide versus oxytetracycline 5.0% (-7.0 to 17.0), versus minocycline 6.2% (-5.8 to 18.2), and versus combined formulation -6.1% (-17.9 to 5.7). Benzoyl peroxide was the most cost-effective treatment. Efficacy of both tetracyclines was reduced by pre-existing tetracycline resistance. INTERPRETATION: Topical benzoyl peroxide and benzoyl peroxide/erythromycin combinations are similar in efficacy to oral oxytetracycline and minocycline and are not affected by propionibacterial antibiotic resistance. "
"Abstract: Fluticasone propionate - the first carbothioate corticosteroid - has been classified as a potent anti-inflammatory drug for dermatological use. It is available as 0.05% cream and 0.005% ointment formulations for the acute and maintenance treatment of patients with dermatological disorders such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and vitiligo. This glucocorticoid is characterized by high lipophilicity, high glucocorticoid receptor binding and activation, and a rapid metabolic turnover in skin. Although skin blanching following fluticasone propionate exceeds that of corticosteroids of medium strength, several clinical trials demonstrate a low potential for cutaneous and systemic side-effects, even in difficult-to-treat areas like the face, the eyelids and intertriginous areas. Even among paediatric patients with atopic dermatitis, fluticasone propionate proved to be safe and effective. These pharmacological and clinical properties are reflected by the high therapeutic index of this glucocorticoid. "
"OBJECTIVES: To determine the relative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of five of the most commonly used antimicrobial preparations for treating mild to moderate facial acne in the community; the propensity of each regimen to give rise to local and systemic adverse events; whether pre-existing bacterial resistance to the prescribed antibiotic resulted in reduced efficacy; and whether some antimicrobial regimens were less likely to give rise to resistant propionibacterial strains. DESIGN: This was a parallel group randomised assessor-blind controlled clinical trial. It was a pragmatic design with intention-to-treat analysis. All treatments were given for 18 weeks, after a 4-week treatment free period. Outcomes were measured at 0, 6, 12 and 18 weeks. SETTING: Primary care practices and colleges in and around Nottingham and Leeds, and one practice in Stockton-on-Tees, England. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 649 people aged 12--39 years, all with mild to moderate inflammatory acne of the face. INTERVENTIONS: Study participants were randomised into one of five groups: 500 mg oral oxytetracycline (non-proprietary) twice daily (b.d.) + topical vehicle control b.d.; 100 mg oral Minocin MR (minocycline) once daily (o.d.) + topical vehicle control b.d.; topical Benzamycin (3% erythromycin + 5% benzoyl peroxide) b.d. + oral placebo o.d.; topical Stiemycin (2% erythromycin) o.d. + topical Panoxyl Aquagel (5% benzoyl peroxide) o.d. + oral placebo o.d., and topical Panoxyl Aquagel (5% benzoyl peroxide) b.d. + oral placebo o.d. (the active comparator group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The two primary outcome measures were: (1) the proportion of patients with at least moderate self-assessed improvement as recorded on a six-point Likert scale, and (2) change in inflamed lesion count (red spots). RESULTS: The best response rates were seen with two of the topical regimens (erythromycin plus benzoyl peroxide administered separately o.d. or in a combined proprietary formulation b.d.), compared with benzoyl peroxide alone, oxytetracycline (500 mg b.d.) and minocycline (100 mg o.d.), although differences were small. The percentage of participants with at least moderate improvement was 53.8% for minocycline (the least effective) and 66.1% for the combined erythromycin/benzoyl peroxide formulation (the most effective); the adjusted odds ratio for these two treatments was 1.74 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 2.90]. Similar efficacy rankings were obtained using lesion counts, acne severity scores and global rating by assessor. Benzoyl peroxide was the most cost-effective and minocycline the least cost-effective regimen (ratio of means 12.3; difference in means -0.051 units/GBP, 95% CI -0.063 to -0.039). The efficacy of oxytetracycline was similar to that of minocycline, but at approximately one-seventh of the cost. For all regimens, the largest reductions in acne severity were recorded in the first 6 weeks. Reductions in disability scores using the Dermatology Quality of Life Scales were largest for both topical erythromycin-containing regimens and minocycline. The two topical erythromycin-containing regimens produced the largest reductions in the prevalence and population density of cutaneous propionibacteria, including antibiotic-resistant variants, and these were equally effective in participants with and without erythromycin-resistant propionibacteria. The clinical efficacy of both tetracyclines was compromised in participants colonised by tetracycline-resistant propionibacteria. None of the regimens promoted an overall increase in the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant strains. Systemic adverse events were more common with the two oral antibiotics. Local irritation was more common with the topical treatments, particularly benzoyl peroxide. Residual acne was present in most participants (95%) at the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS: The response of mild to moderate inflammatory acne to antimicrobial treatment in the community is not optimal. Only around half to two-thirds of trial participants reported at least a moderate improvement over an 18-week study period; extending treatment beyond 12 weeks increased overall benefit slightly. Around one-quarter dropped out when using such treatments, and 55% sought further treatment after 18 weeks. Topical antimicrobial therapies performed at least as well as oral antibiotics in terms of clinical efficacy. Benzoyl peroxide was the most cost-effective and minocycline the least cost-effective therapy for facial acne. The efficacy of all three topical regimens was not compromised by pre-existing propionibacterial resistance. Benzoyl peroxide was associated with a greater frequency and severity of local irritant reactions. It is suggested that the use of a combination of topical benzoyl peroxide and erythromycin gives less irritation and better quality of life. There was little difference between erythromycin plus benzoyl peroxide administered separately and the combined proprietary formulation in terms of efficacy or local irritation, except that the former was nearly three times more cost-effective. The data on cost-effectiveness, and outcomes in patients with resistant propionibacterial floras, did not support the first line use of minocycline for mild to moderate inflammatory acne of the face. Three priority areas for clinical research in acne are: defining end-points in acne trials (i.e. what is a satisfactory outcome?); developing and validating better patient-based measures for assessing treatment effects on facial and truncal acne; and exploring patient characteristics that may modify treatment effects (efficacy and tolerability). "
"Abstract: Topical tazarotene has shown superior efficacy over other topical retinoids, including adapalene and tretinoin, in the treatment of mild to moderate acne. A meta-analysis of data from 6 multicenter, double-blind, randomized comparative trials was performed to determine how patient characteristics influence the efficacy and tolerability of topical tazarotene. Data on 468 patients who used tazarotene 0.1% gel or cream once daily for 12 weeks were collected. Topical tazarotene was effective and well tolerated, regardless of patients' acne severity, skin type, sex, or ethnicity. In general, 'using the cream formulation rather than the gel formulation optimized tolerability. These results indicate that topical tazarotene 0.1% gel and cream are efficacious and well-tolerated treatment options for clearing acne vulgaris across a broad range of patients. "
"Abstract: For most warfarin indications, the target maintenance international normalised ratio (INR) is 2-3. Risk factors for bleeding complications with warfarin use include age, history of past bleeding and specific comorbid conditions. To reverse the effects of warfarin, vitamin K(1) can be given. Immediate reversal is achieved with a prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Vitamin K(1) is essential for sustaining the reversal achieved by PCC and FFP. When oral vitamin K(1) is used for warfarin reversal, the injectable formulation of vitamin K(1) is preferable to tablets because of its flexible dosing; this formulation can be given orally or injected. To temporarily reverse the effect of warfarin when there is a need to continue warfarin therapy, vitamin K(1) should be given in a dose that will quickly lower the INR to a safe, but not subtherapeutic, range and will not cause resistance once warfarin is reinstated. Prothrombinex-HT is the only PCC approved in Australia and New Zealand for warfarin reversal. It contains factors II, IX and X, and low levels of factor VII. FFP should be added to Prothrombinex-HT as a source of factor VII when used for warfarin reversal. Simple dental or dermatological procedures may not require interruption to warfarin therapy. If necessary, warfarin therapy can be withheld 5 days before elective surgery, when the INR usually falls to below 1.5 and surgery can be conducted safely. Bridging anticoagulation therapy for patients at high risk for thromboembolism should be undertaken in consultation with the relevant experts. "
"Abstract: Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) for leukaemia treatment was described a century ago. Recent resurgence in the use of arsenic trioxide is related to its high efficacy in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). Most arsenic trioxide preparations are intravenous, although an oral formulation is similarly efficacious. Side effects of arsenic trioxide are usually minor, including skin reactions, gastrointestinal upset, and reversible increases in transaminases. During therapy, a leukocytosis occasionally occurs, which may be complicated by fluid accumulation and pulmonary infiltration. Arsenic trioxide causes an asymptomatic QT prolongation in most patients. However, if concomitant cardiopulmonary diseases or electrolyte disturbances are present, more sinister arrhythmias may develop. Therefore, before commencement of arsenic trioxide therapy, a full cardiac assessment and avoidance of drugs that prolong QT interval should be instituted. Arsenic trioxide is partly renally excreted and, therefore, dose adjustment is required when renal function is impaired. In addition to its use in APL, arsenic trioxide is now tested in other malignancies, notably multiple myeloma. "
"Abstract: Current treatment paradigms for rosacea focus on inflammatory lesions and other signs and symptoms of rosacea that appear on the skin surface. However, it is important to recognize the effects of the disease and its various treatments not only on the stratum corneum barrier but also on the biofilm. The effects of skin care products, cosmetics, and medications on the stratum corneum and biofilm must be carefully assessed, and nonirritating formulations should be used whenever possible. "
"Abstract: The uses for drug delivery systems of two soybean oil fat emulsions prepared with an emulsifying agent, phosphatidyl choline (PC) or Pluronic F-127 (PLU), were examined comparatively in vivo and in vitro. In the presence of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in vitro, the mean particle size of the PLU emulsion changed less than that of the PC emulsion. The production of non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) from the PLU emulsion in the presence of LPL was smaller than that from the PC emulsion. These in vitro results indicate that the PLU emulsion is more stable than the PC emulsion. Plasma NEFA concentration following intravenous administration of the emulsions decreased with time for the PC emulsion, but was kept lower and constant for the PLU emulsion, supporting the in vitro stability data. The order of plasma cyclosporine A (CsA) concentration following intravenous administration in the above two emulsions and the mixed solution of polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG) and dimethylamide (DMA) in rats was PLU emulsion>PC emulsion>PEG/DMA solution. The plasma concentration was maintained higher and tissue distribution lower for the PLU emulsion than for other formulations. The uptake of oil violet (OV) into the rat parenchymal cells from the PLU emulsion was approximately half that from the PC emulsion, but the uptake into the Kupffer cells was almost equal in both emulsions. In conclusion, these emulsifying agents can control plasma elimination and tissue distribution of lipophilic drugs included in the emulsion. The use of the emulsion formulation makes it possible to avoid side effects through the reduction of drug uptake into non-targeted tissues. "
"Abstract: Dermatologicals as well as other medicinal products are submitted to the rules governing medicinal products in the European Union (EU) (Directive 2001/83/EC). With appreciation of the EU enlargement those regulatories deserve a recent consideration with special regard to the peculiarities of external dermatological therapy, recently passed novel and future guidelines. As regards the criteria for authorization of a medicinal product it is set out in Regulation (EEC) 2309/93 Article 11(1) that a marketing authorization shall be refused if it appears that the quality, the safety or efficacy of the medicinal product have not been adequately or sufficiently demonstrated by the applicant. Article 26(1) of Council Directive 2001/83/EC is worded a little differently but the criteria are the same irrespective of the procedure for the marketing authorization. For the final evaluation of the benefit/risk profile of a topically applied dermatological medicinal product not only the active agent but the whole galenic formulation as well has to be taken into account as the extent of penetration of the active compound might be influenced by changing the non-active substances. Furthermore the vehicle itself - independent of the active agent - influence the dermatological disorder, often in dependence on the stage of the dermatopathy. With special concern to safety/tolerability the (photo)toxic and (photo)allergic potential of the dermatological drug have to be taken into consideration too. In case of total body therapy in children the differing percutaneous resorption due to another body surface/body weight relation deserves special concern. The following review gives a survey of the current most important EU-guidelines for the evaluation of the benefit/risk profile of topically applied dermatological medicinal drugs and an outlook on further developments. As systemically applied dermatological medicinal products are assessed like other systemically applied drugs they are not treated in the following contribution. "
"Abstract: Itraconazole (Sporanox) is a triazole antifungal agent with a broad activity spectrum and favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. Numerous clinical trials have established the efficacy and safety of itraconazole in the treatment of superficial fungal infections. In this field, full exploitation of its pharmacokinetics in keratinized tissues has led to the development of intermittent (pulse) treatment regimens that allow similar efficacy with lower overall drug exposure as well as a reduction in treatment costs. The additional anti-inflammatory action of itraconazole also makes it suitable for application in difficult-to-treat inflammatory skin disorders, such as seborrheic dermatitis. Recently, a new oral liquid formulation and an intravenous formulation have been developed, extending the therapeutic application of itraconazole to systemic fungal infections. Due to its broad activity spectrum and excellent tolerability, itraconazole is a valuable addition to the antifungal armamentarium used for prophylactic and empiric treatment in immunocompromised hosts.

"BACKGROUND: Topical 2-octylcyanoacrylate tissue adhesive is an alternative to traditional devices for closing short surgical incisions. METHODS: An open-label, randomized study compared a new high-viscosity formulation of 2-octylcyanoacrylate with commercially available devices, including low-viscosity 2-octylcyanoacrylate, for epidermal closure of incisions > or = 4 cm requiring subcutaneous and/or deep-dermal suturing. RESULTS: Of patients with 1 to 3 wounds, 106 were treated with high-viscosity 2-octylcyanoacrylate and 103 with commercially available devices. The day-10 rates of healing by wound were 96% and 97% for study versus control treatment and 97% and 95% for new and old 2-octylcyanoacrylate formulations versus other controls, respectively. Day-10 infection rates by wound were 4 of 145 versus 7 of 131 for study versus control treatment and 6 of 207 and 5 of 69 for new and old 2-octylcyanoacrylate versus other controls, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The new tissue adhesive formulation provides epidermal wound closure equivalent to commercially available devices with a trend to decreased incidence of wound infection. "
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate pimecrolimus cream 1% and tacrolimus ointment 0.03% in pediatric patients with moderate atopic dermatitis (AD). METHODS: 141 patients (aged 2-17 years) were randomized to treatment with pimecrolimus cream 1% (n=71) or tacrolimus ointment 0.03% (n=70) twice daily for 6 weeks. RESULTS: At day 4, local, application-site reactions were less common and of shorter duration with pimecrolimus than with tacrolimus. Incidence of erythema/irritation was 8% (6/71) with pimecrolimus compared with 19% (13/70) with tacrolimus (P=.039). Fewer patients receiving pimecrolimus (0%, 0/6) experienced erythema/irritation lasting >30 minutes, compared with those receiving tacrolimus (85%, 11/13; P <.001). Fewer patients reported itching with pimecrolimus (8%; 6/71) than with tacrolimus (20%; 14/70; P=.073). Incidence of warmth, stinging, and burning was similar in both groups; however, reactions lasting >30 minutes were fewer with pimecrolimus (0%, 0/14) than with tacrolimus (67%, 8/12; P <.001). More patients receiving pimecrolimus rated ease of application as 'excellent' or 'very good', compared with tacrolimus (76% vs 59%, respectively; P <.020). Efficacy was similar in both groups at day 43. Both treatments were generally well tolerated with no unexpected adverse events. CONCLUSION: Pimecrolimus cream 1% had better formulation attributes and local tolerability than tacrolimus ointment 0.03% while providing similar efficacy and overall safety in pediatric patients with moderate AD.

"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to study methotrexate (MTX) kinetics and their relation to the effectiveness of the therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Other aims were to analyze the influence of MTX on liver, kidney, hematopoietic function and to determine the possibility of using early drug concentrations to predict the subsequent value of the treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The observations were carried out in 49 patients with RA after the first dose of MTX and after 7 months of treatment. Methotrexate concentrations in blood serum and urine were determined using fluorescence polarization immunoassay applying a TDx Abbott analyzer. RESULTS: No correlation between concentrations, pharmacokinetic parameters and the duration of the disease, its activity, clinical symptoms, observations pertaining to the disease made by physician and patients and morning stiffness of joints was seen. Of those tests for the evaluation of liver, kidney and hematopoietic function, only the mean activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) in urine was significantly elevated both before and after treatment with MTX when compared to corresponding values in the control group of healthy subjects. We have formulated equations allowing for the early recognition of patients with a risk of adverse effects due to impaired elimination of MTX from the body. CONCLUSION: Our results show that monitoring MTX therapy using concentrations in patients with RA does not significantly improve the effectiveness of the treatment, but it can play an important role in increasing the safety of this drug.

"Abstract: Capsaicin-containing plant extracts have been used as topical treatments for a variety of pain syndromes for many centuries. Current products containing capsaicin in low concentrations (usually 0.025-0.075% w/w) have shown efficacy against a variety of pain conditions in clinical studies. However, in order to produce significant analgesic effects, these formulations require frequent re-dosing, often as much as three to five times daily for several weeks. Previous functional and immunohistochemical studies following prolonged exposures to low-concentration capsaicin cream suggested that the duration and onset of analgesic efficacy correlate with a reduction of cutaneous nociceptive sensory nerve fiber responsiveness and immunostaining. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether a single topical application of a high-concentration capsaicin-containing (8%w/w) patch for 120 min or less would induce similar effects on cutaneous nociceptive nerve fibers. Seven days following patch application, changes in heat and cold perception thresholds were determined by quantitative sensory testing and punch biopsies were collected to assess epidermal nerve fiber (ENF) immunostaining density at the application site using PGP 9.5 as a marker. The results show a significant reduction of heat, but not cold, sensitivity and reduction of ENF immunostaining with high-capsaicin concentration patch applications for 60 or 120 min, compared to placebo patch applications. Application sites exposed to low-capsaicin concentration (0.04%w/w) patches for 120 min or high-concentration patches for 30 min were not significantly different from placebo with respect to either thermal threshold detection or ENF immunostaining. The ability of a single 60 min high-concentration patch application to mimic effects produced by prolonged exposure to low-concentration capsaicin creams suggests a new approach to the management of chronic pain syndromes. "
"BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormone receptors are expressed in human skin and are believed to be involved in the regulation of epidermal proliferation and differentiation, i.e. processes which are disturbed in psoriatic skin lesions. Ligands of the thyroid hormone receptors have so far not been tested as antipsoriatic agents. TriAc (3,3',5-triiodo-thyroacetic acid) is a well-known thyroid hormone analogue with much reduced cardiac thyrotoxic activity compared with the classical thyroid hormones. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and side-effects of topical TriAc in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. METHODS: Twelve patients with mild to moderate psoriasis were treated with TriAc (0.1% in hydrophilic ointment) and placebo applied twice daily to either of two (or several) bilaterally symmetrical plaques for 8 weeks. The patients and investigator were blinded as to the content of the tubes. Every 2 weeks the treated plaques were evaluated by the patient (using a balanced visual analogue scale for a right-left comparison) and by the investigator (using a psoriasis severity index and a global assessment of each plaque). RESULTS: After 8 weeks of treatment, more than 33% improvement of the psoriasis index occurred in 10 of 12 TriAc-treated and nine of 12 placebo-treated plaques. There were no statistically significant differences between the treatments in terms of reduction of the scores for erythema, scaling, induration or pruritus during the study. Half of the patients considered TriAc superior to placebo, whereas three of 12 were of the opposite opinion (P > 0.05). The global assessment showed marked improvement or remission in six TriAc-treated and five placebo-treated cases (P > 0.05 for difference). No adverse effects were noted. CONCLUSIONS: TriAc in the dosage and formulation studied was safe but no more effective than placebo in treating plaque psoriasis. However, newer thyroid hormone analogues (agonists or antagonists) might be more active and should be further explored in this context. "
"BACKGROUND: Combination therapy with antiseptics such as benzoyl peroxide (BP) and topical retinoids is widely used as first-line treatment for acne vulgaris (AV). However, these combinations could have a suboptimal skin tolerability. Recently, a new formulation of hydrogen peroxide (HP) 1% in stabilized cream (Crystacide; Mipharm, Milan, Italy) became available. A previous clinical study has shown that HP cream monotherapy presents a better skin tolerability in comparison with BP in patients with mild AV. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the tolerability and the efficacy of combination therapy with HP cream and adapalene 0.1% gel in comparison with the combination of BP 4% cream and adapalene 0.1% gel in the treatment of mild to moderate AV. METHODS: In a randomized, investigator-blinded trial, 52 patients (mean +/- SD age 25 +/- 6 years; 19 men and 33 women) with AV were randomly assigned to HP cream and adapalene gel (group HP + A) or to BP cream and adapalene gel (group BP + A), for eight consecutive weeks. Efficacy was assessed by total (TL), inflammatory (IL) and noninflammatory (NL) lesion counts performed at baseline and weeks 4 and 8. Tolerability was assessed by evaluating skin erythema, burning and dryness at weeks 4 and 8. RESULTS: All patients completed the study. At baseline, the mean +/- SD numbers of TL, IL and NL were 44 +/- 9, 25 +/- 7 and 19 +/- 6 in group HP + A and 40 +/- 9, 21 +/- 7 and 19 +/- 9 in group BP + A, respectively. At the end of the treatment period, TL, IL and NL were reduced by 93%, 92% and 95%, respectively, in group HP + A and by 88%, 86% and 90%, respectively, in group BP + A. A significantly (P = 0.0025) greater reduction in NL was observed in group HP + A in comparison with group BP + A. Tolerability was significantly better in group HP + A in comparison with group BP + A (P = 0.02). Skin dryness and burning sensation were more frequent in group BP + A. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of adapalene and HP cream is an effective topical treatment regimen in mild to moderate AV. This combination has shown a better tolerability profile in comparison with the combination of BP and adapalene. "
"BACKGROUND: Current immunosuppressant regimens need to be improved to prevent acute and chronic graft rejection. The novel macrocyclic immunosuppressant everolimus (Certican, RAD) is currently in clinical development to address this issue. METHODS: The primary objective of this multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating phase 1 study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of everolimus at four dose levels (0.75, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/day) in maintenance renal transplant patients receiving cyclosporin and steroids. The secondary objective was to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of two different formulations (capsule and tablet) of everolimus. RESULTS: Fifty-four subjects were randomized for 4 weeks treatment with everolimus (n = 44) or placebo (n = 10). Dose levels of everolimus between 0.75 and 5 mg daily were well tolerated, permitting dose escalation to the highest everolimus dose of 10 mg daily. At this dose, everolimus was associated with a higher incidence and severity of adverse events, most notably thrombocytopenia. Pharmacodynamic assessment showed a relationship between drug exposure and thrombocytopenia. Notable reversible elevations of cholesterol were also observed at the 10 mg/day dose. Other changes in laboratory evaluations, including triglycerides, were minor, reversible and did not appear to be dose dependent. The bioavailability of the tablet formulation was 2.6-fold higher compared with the capsule, with evidence for dose proportionality over the dose range tested. Within-subject pharmacokinetic variability was low (coefficient of variation: 10-19%); however, between-subject variability ranged from 34 to 60% for AUC and C(max). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that up to 5 mg/day everolimus results in a dose-proportional exposure, and is adequately well tolerated in renal transplant recipients receiving cyclosporin and steroids.

"Abstract: In 1999, a robust dose-finding study showed that the chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) -free formulation of beclometasone dipropionate (BDP), QVAR (hydrofluoroalkane-134a BDP), produced equivalent asthma control to CFC-BDP at approximately half the daily dose in adults. Since then, a wealth of clinical and pharmaco-vigilance studies have been undertaken to confirm these results and establish dose-potency ratios with other inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). This review summarises the results of studies performed by the manufacturer that have been published since the last comprehensive review of the efficacy and safety of QVAR in 2000. Long-term comparisons with CFC-BDP have confirmed the durability of the 2:1 daily dosing ratio of CFC-BDP:QVAR in adults. Clinical comparisons with other ICS in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients have established dose-potency ratios of 2: 1 for budesonide:QVAR and 1:1 for fluticasone:QVAR. Furthermore, QVAR has been associated with benefits on asthma symptomatology and quality of life, compared with other ICS that probably arises from its peripheral deposition in the lung. "
"Abstract: Cellulite is the unsightly dimpling and nodularity frequently found on the thighs and buttocks of post-adolescent women. The anatomy and pathophysiology of this unwanted condition is poorly understood. The paucity of research studies to date has led to a dormancy of scientifically based therapeutic options that are effective and tolerable. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of a novel topical agent based on a plausible pathophysiologic mechanism in the treatment of cellulite, and to compare the efficacy of this agent used in combination with an occlusive bioceramic-coated neoprene garment, to the agent used alone without occlusion. We will also review the current understanding of the etiology and nature of cellulite and summarize available treatment options. Twenty women with a moderate degree of cellulite were entered into a four-week, double-blinded, randomized trial where an anti-cellulite cream was applied to the affected sites on a nightly basis. Each subject was randomized to receive occlusion by a bioceramic-coated neoprene garment on either the right or left leg, with the contralateral side serving as a control with no occlusion. High-quality digital photography was taken before treatment and after four weeks at various angles, with tangential full-spectrum lighting. Four blinded, independent dermatologist reviewers assessed the photographs for improvement. Subjects completed questionnaire forms to assess tolerability and efficacy. Of the 17 subjects who completed the study, 76% noticed an overall improvement in their cellulite, with 54% reporting greater improvement in the thigh that received garment occlusion. The average measured decrease in thigh circumference was 1.2 cm, noting a 1.3 cm reduction with occlusion and a 1.1 cm reduction without occlusion. Upon review of the pre- and post-study photographs, the dermatologist evaluators found an improvement in 65% of treated legs with occlusion, and 59% of treated legs without occlusion. Further, the evaluators found the occluded thighs to show greater improvement than the non-occluded thighs in 65% of subjects. The topical agent used in this study was found to be effective in reducing the appearance of cellulite. Bioceramic-coated neoprene garment occlusion potentiates the effect of this topical agent in cellulite reduction. The success of this study validates the pathophysiologic mechanism used to formulate the topical agent used. "
"Abstract: Melasma is a common hyperpigmentation of the face or neck that can have severe adverse psychological and emotional effects on affected individuals. Although a variety of treatments have been used over the years, results have typically been less than satisfactory. An open-label, community-based trial was undertaken at 393 centers in the United States, enrolling 1290 patients representing a broad range of races/ethnicities and all Fitzpatrick skin types, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new melasma treatment that combines fluocinolone acetonide 0.01%, hydroquinone 4.0%, and tretinoin 0.05% (FA+HQ+RA) in a hydrophilic cream formulation. An additional objective of the study was to assess the impact of this therapy on the quality of life. Efficacy and safety were evaluated at 4 and 8 weeks, and changes in a variety of quality of life parameters were analyzed at the conclusion of the study. All measures of efficacy showed that FA+HQ+RA significantly (p<0.0001) improved melasma at 4 weeks with further improvement at 8 weeks across all races/ethnicities and Fitzpatrick skin types. The treatment was safe and well tolerated. After 8 weeks of therapy, patients reported that FA+HQ+RA had provided a variety of benefits that had enhanced their quality of life. "
"BACKGROUND: Mycophenolate mofetil has replaced azathioprine in immunosuppression regimens worldwide to prevent graft rejection. However, evidence that its antirejection activity is better than that of azathioprine has been provided only by registration trials with an old formulation of ciclosporin and steroid. We aimed to compare the antirejection activity of these two drugs with a new formulation of ciclosporin. METHODS: The mycophenolate steroids sparing multicentre, prospective, randomised, parallel-group trial compared acute rejections and adverse events in recipients of cadaver-kidney transplants over 6-month treatment with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine along with ciclosporin microemulsion (Neoral) and steroids (phase A), and over 15 more months without steroids (phase B). The primary endpoint was occurrence of acute rejection episodes. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: 168 patients per group entered phase A. 56 (34%) assigned mycophenolate mofetil and 58 (35%) assigned azathioprine had clinical rejections (risk reduction [RR] on mycophenolate mofetil compared with azathioprine 13.7% [95% CI -25.7% to 40.7%], p=0.44). 88 patients in the mycophenolate mofetil group and 89 in the azathioprine group entered phase B. 14 (16%) taking mycophenolate mofetil and 11 (12%) taking azathioprine had clinical rejections (RR -16.2%, [-157.5% to 47.5%], p=0.71). Average per-patient costs of mycophenolate mofetil treatment greatly exceeded those of azathioprine (phase A 2665 Euros [SD 586] vs Euros 184 [62]; phase B 5095 Euros [2658] vs 322 Euros [170], p<0.0001 for both). INTERPRETATION: In recipients of cadaver kidney-transplants given ciclosporin microemulsion, mycophenolate mofetil offers no advantages over azathioprine in preventing acute rejections and is about 15 times more expensive. Standard immunosuppression regimens for transplantation should perhaps include azathioprine rather than mycophenolate mofetil, at least for kidney grafts. "
"Abstract: We report on an unexpected sensitization to petrolatum diagnosed with the occurrence of multiple nonrelevant and false-positive drug patch-tests performed while investigating a patient suffering from many cutaneous adverse drug reactions. All the positive drug patch-tests were prepared with GILBERT vaseline. This petrolatum reaction is positive as it was tested with five other brands of petrolatums a few months later. As the same petrolatums, but from different batches were tested, patch-tests with GILBERT petrolatum were doubtful, while other petrolatums were positive. White petrolatum is a mixture of semisolid hydrocarbons of the methane series. The sensitizing impurities of petrolatum are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. phenanthrene derivatives. The purity of petrolatum depends on both the petroleum stock and on the production and packaging methods. Even if rare, contact sensitization to petrolatum can disturb the interpretation of drug patch-tests. It is necessary in the interpretation of drug patch-tests to test both in petrolatum and other vehicles and with all the different petrolatums used in preparing the material for drug patch-tests. So, it is essential to advise the patients sensitized to petrolatum to remove all the topical drugs, such as all the cosmetics, which contain petrolatum in their formulation. "
"Abstract: The antihistaminic chlorpheniramine maleate (CPM) is used for symptomatic relief of hypersensitivity reactions and in pruritic skin disorders. At present, the drug is marketed in tablet, capsule, syrup, cream, and injectable dosage forms. Chlorpheniramine maleate has some side effects when taken orally. Due to its first pass effect, only 25%-45% of the orally administered dose reaches the blood circulation. To bypass these disadvantages, we aimed to investigate percutaneous absorption of CPM from gel formulations prepared with different carbomer derivatives (Carbopol 934, 940, 941, 2984, 980, and 981; main differences are related to presence of a comonomer and cross-link density). Cellulose membrane was used as the diffusion barrier for all the formulations' drug-release studies. The release of active substance from carbopol derivatives, which have the least cross-linking density (Carbopol 941 and 981) was found to be numerically higher than the others. The formulation (F8; 1% Carbopol 941) that exhibited the maximum drug release through the cellulose membrane was further studied for drug release by using polyurethane membrane, excised rat skin, and human skin. The penetration of the active substance through different diffusion barriers was found to be statistically different (p<0.05) when compared. Of all the different diffusion barriers, rat skin gave the closest results to human skin. Thus topical application of CPM in the carbomer gel may be of potential use for local activity. The type and concentration of carbomers can affect drug release. The synthetic membranes are useful in assessments of formulations in quality assurance but they do not give definite indication of how a formulation will behave when it is used on skin. "
"Abstract: Intranasal medications for the treatment of headache have recently received increased attention. This paper reviews intranasal formulations of a variety of available medications (dihydroergotamine mesylate [dihydroergotamine mesilate], sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, butorphanol, capsaicin and lidocaine [lignocaine]) and one experimental medication (civamide, a cis-isomer of capsaicin) for the treatment of migraine and cluster headache. Although the efficacy of intranasal agents varies with the product used, intranasal delivery may be both convenient and more effective than other modes of drug delivery for a variety of reasons: (i) intranasal administration bypasses small bowel gastrointestinal tract absorption, which is often significantly delayed during the acute phase of a migraine attack; (ii) nauseated patients may prefer non-oral formulations as they decrease the chance of vomiting and are more rapidly effective; (iii) intranasal administration causes no pain or injection site reaction and is easier and more convenient to administer than injection or suppository and so may be used earlier in a migraine attack, resulting in better efficacy; (iv) intranasal medication produces the same number or fewer adverse events than injections; and (v) intranasal formulations offer a more rapid onset of action than oral medications, for some of the above reasons and, as such, may be more useful in patients with cluster headache, although this needs to be verified. However, it is important to emphasise that a preference study showed that most patients prefer oral tablets to an intranasal formulation. Also, some nasal preparations have significant adverse effects or are not well absorbed and therefore do not work consistently; others are more challenging to administer as a result of their delivery apparatus. Nevertheless, it is our opinion that nasal preparations increase therapeutic options and may result in faster response times and better efficacy than oral formulations and better patient satisfaction than injectable preparations. "
"Abstract: Toxicology studies are typically performed on single compounds, which we hypothesized would miss adverse synergies from chemical mixtures. This hypothesis was tested using an insect repellant and sunscreens because both groups include known permeation enhancers, with prior pediatric reports of toxicity from highly concentrated DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide). Using real-time mass spectroscopy in a hairless mouse skin model, we confirmed substantial penetration of a 20% DEET standard. Despite a lower (10%) DEET content, a commercially marketed sunscreen formulation had a 6-fold more rapid detection (5 versus 30 min) and 3.4-fold greater penetration at steady state. We also tested the efficacy of DEET microemulsion products and confirmed that one successfully slowed the onset of absorption, but not the steady-state permeation. Risks from mixtures of potential toxins are worthy of routine testing, which can be accomplished by simple assays, and are of utmost importance for pediatric applications. "
"BACKGROUND: Following the introduction of ciclosporine (CsA), the 2-year survival of transplanted kidneys improved from less than 60% to over 80%. Though the introduction of this drug resulted in a marked improvement in graft survival, its use was not without problems. Variable absorption and a narrow therapeutic index resulted in the need for measurements of CsA blood concentrations to tailor the drug dose to maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing toxicity. METHODS: Data were available from the LOTESS study of 4948 transplant patients receiving Neoral with at least 5 years' follow-up. Potential risk factors associated with outcome in renal transplant recipients treated with CsA were explored: the primary outcome variable was graft loss. A stepwise binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify donor, recipient, and treatment variables related to outcome. RESULTS: In the initial analysis, chronic rejection was the only significant predictor of graft loss. The relative risk (RR) of graft loss was 16.9 (95% CI = 13.9-20.4). Further analysis identified four independent risk factors for chronic rejection cadaveric donor (RR, 1.50; 95% CI = 1.05-2.15), older donor (RR, 1.02; 95% CI = 1.01-1.02), younger recipient (RR, 1.02; 95% CI = 1.02-1.03), and variable predose CsA concentration (RR, 1.25; 95% CI = 1.06-1.48). CONCLUSION: With the UK kidney transplant waiting list at about 5000 patients and only 1658 transplants performed during 2002, it is important maximize graft survival. For example, perhaps marginal donors (age > 55) can be matched to older recipients without increasing the risk of chronic allograft nephropathy and therefore graft loss. Variable predose CsA concentrations may arise from at least three different sources: adherence to treatment, drug formulation, and individual variation in absorption. Therefore, it is important to emphaze to patients that erratic compliance may increase their risk of graft loss. Second, although only one CsA formulation is marketed in the UK, when generic forms of CsA are introduced it will be important to demonstrate consistent delivery of CsA from these new formulations. Third, improved monitoring of CsA using a C2 rather than a predose blood concentration measurement may be used to reduce intra-individual variations in drug exposure. "
"Abstract: The effect of manganese doping on the free radical generation rate, free radical scavenging and UVA absorption properties of micronised sunscreen grade titania has been studied with respect to enhancement of the UVA photostability of test sunscreen formulations containing the organic UVA absorber Parsol 1789. Manganese doping has been shown to increase the UVA:UVB absorption ratio of titania, reduce free radical generation rates by over 90%, and provide free radical scavenging behaviour. Adding manganese-doped titania to a test formulation incorporating Parsol 1789 shows that manganese doping increases UVA attenuation stability by up to 3 times the amount achieved by comparable commercial undoped titania materials. HPLC data shows this to be related to an improved stabilisation of the organic sunscreen components. Manganese doped titania shows improved efficacy over undoped titania in sunscreen formulations containing organic UV absorbers. "
"BACKGROUND: Difficulties in avoiding weak irritants may contribute to chronic contact dermatitis. A large variety of shower and bath oils are claimed to be suitable for use on dry skin because of their mildness and because they deposit a protective oil film on the skin. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate possible differences in the irritation potential of eight shower or bath oils and to investigate whether surfactant residues may form a reservoir of irritant substance on the skin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was double-blind and randomized using healthy human volunteers. The inherent capacity of the products to induce irritation was determined using conventional patch test techniques. Detection of potentially irritant residues was done by occlusion of the treated and rinsed skin area, followed by evaluation of the biological response. Instrumental measurements of transepidermal water loss and superficial skin blood flow served as indicators of the injurious effects of the products. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results showed large differences between the products in irritant potential. Some did not irritate skin more than water, whereas others demonstrated considerably damaging effects. Moreover, the study proved the presence of barrier-impairing residues on the skin after rinsing with water. Thus, instead of protecting the skin, some formulations may induce subclinical injuries and delay skin barrier function recovery with prolonged risk for patients with eczema. "
"Abstract: Hydroxyzine, an effective but sedating H1-antihistamine is given orally to treat allergic skin disorders. This study was performed to assess the peripheral H(1)-antihistaminic activity and extent of systemic absorption of hydroxyzine from liposomes applied to the skin. Using L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine (PC), small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) and multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) containing hydroxyzine were prepared. Hydroxyzine in Glaxal Base (GB) was used as the control. Using a randomized, crossover design, each formulation, containing 10 mg of hydroxyzine, was applied to the shaved backs of 6 rabbits (3.08 +/- 0.05 kg). Histamine-induced wheal tests and blood sampling were performed at designated time intervals up to 24 hours. Compared with baseline, hydroxyzine from all formulations significantly suppressed histamine-induced wheal formation by 75% to 95% for up to 24 hours. Mean maximum suppression, 85% to 94%, occurred from 2 to 6 hours, with no differences among the formulations. The areas of plasma hydroxyzine concentration versus time area under the curve (AUCs) from PC-SUV and PC-MLV, 80.1 +/- 20.8 and 78.4 +/- 33.9 ng/mL/h, respectively, were lower than that from GB, 492 +/- 141 ng/mL/h (P < or =.05) over 24 hours. Plasma concentrations of cetirizine arising in-vivo as the active metabolite of hydroxyzine, from PC-SUV, PC-MLV, and GB, were similar with AUCs of 765 +/- 50, 1035 +/- 202, and 957 +/- 227 ng/mL/h, respectively (P < or =.05). Only 0.02% to 0.06% of the initial hydroxyzine dose remained on the skin after 24 hours. In this model, hydroxyzine from SUV and MLV had excellent topical H1-antihistaminic activity, and minimal systemic exposure occurred. Cetirizine formed in-vivo contributed to some of H1-antihistaminic activity. "
"OBJECTIVES: Retinoic acid (RA) has long been used, both topically and systemically, for disorders of keratinization, acne and related disorders. In the present study, the efficacy and tolerability of topical RA prepared as a cyclodextrin beta complex (beta-CD) is investigated in 66 acne vulgaris patients. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compares nightly topical application of RA/beta-CD complex hydrogel formulation (0.025%), RA/beta-CD complex in moisturizing base (0.025%), hydrogel base, moisturizer base or a commercial RA gel (0.05%) in acne vulgaris patients. Improvement of acne was assessed using a 5-point improvement scale and by measuring sebum and moisture content of the skin using an SM 810 sebumeter/corneometer. RESULTS: After 3 months of treatment, mean scores of acne improvement on the 5-point scale were 4 with the RA/beta-CD complex hydrogel formulation, 4.1 with the RA/beta-CD complex in moisturizing base, 1.2 with hydrogel placebo base, 1.1 with moisturizer placebo base and 3 with the commercial RA product. All patients treated with the commercial product experienced local side-effects. One patient discontinued due to severe irritation. None of the patients treated with the RA/beta-CD complex in the moisturizing base and hydrogel formulation experienced significant local irritation, although the sebum content of the skin decreased after application of the RA/beta-CD preparations. This change was not significant compared to controls. The moisture content of the skin was better preserved in the group treated with the RA/beta-CD complex in the moisturizing base. CONCLUSION: The topical RA/beta-CD complex, in hydrogel and moisturizing base, was more effective than the twice concentrated commercial RA product. There were few topical side-effects with this new formulation, which increases patient compliance. Topical RA/beta-CD (0.025% RA) did not significantly reduce sebum secretion but may help to preserve optimum epidermal moisture content with the proper base formulation. This is the first study in the literature reporting efficacy and tolerability of the topical RA/beta-CD complex in acne vulgaris. We conclude that the topical RA/beta-CD complex displays an improved efficacy and tolerability profile and is an effective treatment alternative for acne vulgaris. "
"Abstract: Mometasone furoate (MF) and fluticasone propionate (FP) are high potency inhaled corticosteroids. The systemic bioavailability of MF is claimed to be negligible, leading to a minimal potential for systemic adverse effects. We assessed the overnight urinary cortisol/creatinine as the primary outcome of adrenal suppression in 21 patients with persistent asthma (mean FEV1 = 91%). Patients were randomized in a crossover fashion to receive 2 weekly consecutive doubling incremental doses of either FP Accuhaler (500, 1,000, and 2,000 microg/day) or MF Twisthaler (400, 800, and 1,600 microg/day). For the 21 per protocol completed patients, there was significant suppression of overnight urinary cortisol/creatinine with high and medium doses of both drugs-as geometric mean fold suppression (95% confidence interval) from baseline: FP 2,000 microg, 1.85 (1.21-2.82, p = 0.002); FP 1,000 microg, 1.45 (1.07-1.96, p = 0.02); MF 1,600 microg, 1.92 (1.26-2.93, p = 0.001); and MF 800 microg, 1.39 (1.04-1.88, p = 0.02). For secondary outcomes of 8:00 A.M. plasma cortisol, serum osteocalcin, and early morning urinary cortisol/creatinine, there was significant suppression with MF and FP at the highest dose. Our data refute the assertion that MF has negligible systemic bioavailability and a lower potential for systemic adverse effects compared with FP. "
"Abstract: We previously developed a new formulation of methotrexate (MTX) that is adsorbed onto a suspension of activated carbon particles (MTX-CH) and reported the usefulness of local administration in murine tumors. The present study examines the effects of human colon carcinoma (LoVo) xenografts and the acute toxicity of MTX-CH compared with MTX aqueous solution (MTX-AQ) in mice. In therapeutic experiments, LoVo cells were implanted into the backs of BALB/c nude mice. When the cells had developed into tumors, we performed an intratumoral administration of a weekly dose of 30 mg/kg. The MTX concentration in the tumor was compared between the MTX-CH group and MTX-AQ group. In experiments on acute toxicity, MTX-CH and MTX-AQ were injected subcutaneously in BDF1 mice, and intoxication symptoms, changes in body weight, and date of death were recorded. In the therapeutic experiments, intratumoral administration of MTX-CH was much more effective in suppressing the tumor growth compared with MTX-AQ. In experiments of acute toxicity, the death time of the MTX-CH group was delayed to a greater extent, and the 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) values of MTX-CH were lower than those of MTX-AQ. The LD(50) values of MTX-CH are 75 times higher than the efficacious dose of 30 mg/kg. The present results suggest that intratumoral administration of MTX-CH is useful for local therapy and the therapeutic dose of MTX-CH can be safely injected subcutaneously. "
"BACKGROUND: Simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPK) transplantation has become an accepted therapy for type 1 diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease. This open-label, multicenter study compared the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus with the microemulsion (ME) formulation of cyclosporine in a clinical setting. The 1-year results are reported here. METHODS: The study was conducted in 10 European centers and one center in Israel. One hundred three patients were randomly assigned to tacrolimus and 102 to cyclosporine-ME. All patients received concomitant rabbit anti-T-cell globulin induction therapy, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and short-term cortico-steroids. The initial daily oral doses were 0.2 mg/kg for tacrolimus, 7 mg/kg for cyclosporine-ME, and 2 to 3 g for MMF. RESULTS: The 1-year incidence of biopsy-proven kidney or pancreas acute rejection was lower with tacrolimus (27.2%) than with cyclosporine-ME (38.2%; P = 0.09). Pancreas graft survival at 1 year was 91.3% with tacrolimus and 74.5% with cyclosporine-ME (P <0.0005). Renal graft survival was similar in the two study groups. There were no significant treatment-related differences in pancreatic or renal graft function. In total, 34 patients switched treatment from cyclosporine-ME to tacrolimus, but only 6 patients receiving tacrolimus required alternative therapy. Mean doses of MMF at 1 year were also lower in the tacrolimus group (1.36 vs. 1.67 g/day; P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: These findings support the use of tacrolimus therapy for uremic patients with type 1 diabetes who are undergoing SPK transplantation. "
"Abstract: Loteprednol etabonate (LE) is a glucocorticoid soft drug that is currently in development for intranasal use. The main objectives of this study were to examine the pharmacokinetics and potential effects on systemic cortisol of two intranasal suspension formulations of LE and to compare these findings with placebo and fluticasone propionate (FP, Flonase) control treatments. In this randomized, double-blind (except for FP), parallel-group study (n = 8/group), all subjects received for 14 days once daily in the morning two puffs of the following nasal spray formulations into each nostril: LE 0.1% (400 microg/day), LE 0.2% (800 microg/day), FP 0.05% (200 microg/day), and placebo. Drug trough levels were determined on days 1, 5, 12, 13, and 14, and a full pharmacokinetic profile was established on day 14, and 24-hour serum cortisol profiles were assessed prior to treatment (i.e., at baseline) and after the last dose. All subjects completed the protocol without treatment-emergent adverse findings. All formulations were rapidly absorbed (t(max) less than 1 h). The rather short mean terminal half-lives of 2.2 +/- 1.5 hours and 1.8 +/- 1.0 hours for LE 400 microg and LE 800 microg, respectively, and 4.2 +/- 1.8 hours for the 200-microg FP treatment explained the lack of any accumulation. Mean peak concentrations (C(max)) were 139 +/- 57 pg/mL with LE 400 microg and 164 +/- 54 pg/mL with LE 800 microg and thus fairly independent from dose. The 200-microg FP treatment resulted in a C(max) of only 15.5 +/- 5.9 pg/mL. Mean measured AUC(0-t) values (193 +/- 87 pg/h/mL(-1), 300 +/- 183 pg/h/mL(-1), and 40 +/- 34 pg/h/mL(-1) for LE 400 microg, LE 800 microg, and FP 200 microg, respectively) showed high variability and suggested nonlinear pharmacokinetics for the LE formulations, indicative of a less complete systemic uptake of LE from the 0.2% concentration. None of the treatments (LE 400 microg, LE 800 microg, and FP 200 microg) showed evidence for serum cortisol suppression when compared with placebo, respectively. The uptake and systemic exposure appears less complete from the 0.2% LE concentration, which principally favors this formulation for further clinical development. "
"Abstract: The use of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs; cyclosporine and tacrolimus) has dramatically increased medium-term life expectancy after heart transplantation but has had only limited impact on long-term outcomes for heart transplant recipients. The original oil-based formulation of cyclosporine has been superceded by a microemulsion formulation (Neoral), which has more predictable pharmacokinetics and allows more precise dose-tailoring. Cyclosporine microemulsion and tacrolimus (Prograf) have a similar efficacy in the prevention of acute rejection of heart transplants, but their use is accompanied by nephrotoxicity and by cardiovascular side effects. The efficacy of immunosuppression can be improved by adjunctive therapy, such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; Cellcept), corticosteroids, and induction therapy. One of the most important predictors of patient mortality at >5 years after heart transplantation is cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV)/late graft failure, which accounts for 31% of deaths. Neither cyclosporine nor tacrolimus have been shown to prevent the development of CAV. In terms of efficacy, MMF provides a modest advantage over azathioprine in preventing CAV, and the combination of cyclosporine plus MMF results in significantly lower mortality than cyclosporine plus azathioprine. Overall, CNIs have multiple cardiovascular side effects, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia and new-onset diabetes after transplantation, although cyclosporine and tacrolimus have somewhat different cardiovascular side-effect profiles. The challenge in choosing the best immunosuppressive regimen is to balance efficacy and safety to optimize graft and patient survival over the course of many decades. Because cyclosporine and tacrolimus have similar efficacy against acute rejection the choice of CNI for heart transplant recipients should be based on the relative risk of cardiovascular and renal side effects. "
"Abstract: In this study, we compared the irritation inhibition of various types of anti-irritants such as antihistamines (cyprohetadine, diphenhydramine, and promethazine), alpha-hydroxy acids (gluconolactone and gluco-delta-lactone), corticosteroids (betamethasone and clobetasol), and ion channel modulating agents (amiloride, ethacrynic acid, nifedipine, and verapamil) on the adverse dermatological reaction caused by captopril gel using noninvasive bioengineering methods including measuring the transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and the color change of skin surface [such as change chroma (delta C) and difference in color (delta E) between the gel-treated site and the untreated site]. In addition, the influence of these anti-irritants on the penetration capacity of captopril through the rabbit skin was also investigated. The results showed that the TEWL, change chroma (delta C), and difference in color (delta E) of skin were significantly reduced via incorporating diphenhydramine and clobetasol, indicating that both substances had potent irritation inhibition activity. Moreover, these substances had no effect on the percutaneous absorption of captopril gel. However, flux of the captopril with anti-irritants was about 480 microg/cm2/h and the required minimum administration area to obtain the minimum effective concentration was about 15 cm2, indicating that this formulation could possibly be developed for a transdermal drug delivery system.

"Abstract: The goal of the German drug safety program in psychiatry AMSP (Arzneimittelsicherheit in der Psychiatrie) is the assessment of severe or new adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Here we report on 53,042 of 122,562 patients treated with antidepressants who were monitored from 1993 to 2000 in 35 psychiatric hospitals in German-speaking countries. The overall incidence of severe ADRs of antidepressants was 1.4 % of exposed patients; when only ADRs rated as probable or definite were considered, a rate of 0.9 % in patients treated with antidepressants was observed. ADR rates were higher for TCAs (imputed in 1.0 % of patients overall, respectively in 0.6 % of patients when only ADs were imputed) and lower for MAO inhibitors and SSRIs (0.7 % for both, respectively 0.3 % and 0.4 %). Within the TCA group there was a difference among clomipramine (2.1 %, respectively 1.0 %), amitriptyline (1.0 %, respectively 0.6 %), and doxepin or trimipramine (both 0.6 %, respectively 0.3 %). With regard to single SSRI, similar rates were observed for paroxetine (0.8 %, respectively 0.5 %) and for citalopram (0.7 %, respectively 0.4 %). Of the new dual-acting antidepressants, venlafaxine ranged at 0.9 %, (respectively 0.5 %) and mirtazapine at 0.6 % (respectively 0.5 %). In particular, TCAs were associated with known risks, such as toxic delirium, grand mal seizures, and hepatic (i. e., increased liver enzymes), urologic (i. e., urinary retention), allergic (i. e., exanthema), or cardiovascular (i. e., mainly orthostatic collapse) reactions. In SSRI-treated patients (non-delirious) psychic and neurological ADRs were most prominent, followed by gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and endocrinological/electrolyte reactions, with agitation, hyponatremia (probably as part of the SIADH syndrome and associated with severe neurologic or psychiatric symptoms in 64 % of all cases), increased liver enzymes, nausea, and the serotonin syndrome as leading unwanted symptoms. Venlafaxine (in the immediate-release formulation) was associated with adverse CNS and somatic symptoms such as severe agitation, diarrhea, increased liver enzymes, hypertension, and hyponatremia. Mirtazapine was mostly connected with increased liver enzymes, cutaneous edema, and collapse, but with no case of significant hyponatremia. For drugs that potently inhibit serotonin uptake, serum sodium concentration should be controlled when applied in high-dose therapy or in vulnerable patients. "
"AIM: The 60% bioavailable oral microemulsion formulation of cyclosporin (NEORAL ), has replaced the intravenous route to treat both organ transplant and immune-based disease. Its use for steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis (a recognized indication for intravenous cyclosporin) has been scanty. METHODS: Twenty-three consecutive patients (14 male/9 female, universal colitis 14/23) entered a 3-month course of NEORAL (initially dosed at 5 mg/kg/day) because of steroid-refractoriness (14 cases) and steroid-dependence (9 cases). Responders (at least showing a 50% reduction of a clinical activity score) were continued on azathioprine. The initial steroid dose was tapered on commencing NEORAL; patients requiring steroid resumption or increase in the follow-up were defined as relapsers. RESULTS: The target trough concentration of 200 ng/ml of whole blood was achieved without major titration in all but 1 patient. There were 7 non-responders (30%). Of the 16 responders (70%), 2 have not relapsed; the remaining 14 relapsed at the median time of 9.5 months (1.5-60) with 10 (71%) showing only 1 relapse. Five patients were colectomized 12 months after NEORAL (1.5-24), leaving 11 of the initial 23 (47%) with their colon. Of the 16, all but 1 had azathioprine; the median daily steroid needs fell from 32 to 5 mg. CONCLUSION: The rates of acute and chronic response of 70% and 47% achieved by NEORAL in this indication duplicate the figures achieved by the traditional schedules of cyclosporin administration. "
"Abstract: Since its introduction 20 years ago, cyclosporine (CyA), a powerful immunosuppressant with a narrow therapeutic window, remains the cornerstone of many drug regimens in renal transplantation. However, attempts to balance its therapeutic value with its pleiotropic side effects continue to challenge clinicians. To address the wide intraindividual and interindividual differences in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of the oil-based formulation of CyA (Sandimmune), a microemulsion (Neoral) was introduced; it displayed better absorption and lower intraindividual variability. Neoral also improves the utility of therapeutic monitoring of CyA to estimate exposure to the drug and predict patient outcomes. Drug monitoring techniques are undergoing continual refinement: today, a limited sampling strategy--C2 monitoring--shows great promise as a comparatively simple, safe, and effective method to optimize patient outcomes during both short-term and maintenance CyA therapy. However, it is not clear whether this method is useful for treatment optimization with generic formulations of CyA. Although generic substitutes meet federal bioequivalence criteria, they may not display the same pharmacokinetic properties. Further, preliminary data have shown a 10% lower 1-year graft survival rate among patients treated with generic versus Neoral CyA. Current challenges in optimizing CyA therapy include determining pretransplant patient characteristics relevant to selection of the appropriate exposure or the development of a Bayesian forecasting technique that predicts dose adjustments necessary to achieve the optimal drug regimen during the critical period immediately posttransplant. "
"Abstract: The introduction of cyclosporine as an immunosuppressant in early 1980s dramatically improved the outcome of organ transplantation. The adverse effects of nephrotoxicity and increased incidence of lymphomas were recognized with high doses of cyclosporine during the early part of that decade. This led to lower doses of cyclosporine and combination with prednisolone and azathioprine as the basis of immunosuppression in transplantation. During the second half of the 1990s, the microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine was introduced that gave superior and predictable drug absorption profiles. Therapeutic drug monitoring is considered as a tool to optimize transplantation results and minimize side effects. The nephrotoxicity associated with long-term cyclosporine therapy is recognized; we are learning to take measures to minimize it. As we enter the third decade of cyclosporine use, cyclosporine-based immunosuppressive protocols remain the most popular method in heart transplantation. Newer agents in combination with cyclosporine as the core immunosuppressant are being explored. "
"Abstract: The use of cyclosporine (CyA) in clinical thoracic transplantation has markedly improved the survival and quality of life of patients in the past 2 decades. In the mid-1990s a significant advance in formulation design took place with the introduction of Neoral. This new microemulsion formulation of CyA demonstrates reduced intersubject and intrasubject variability in absorption and improved oral bioavailability compared with the oil-based CyA formulation. Moreover, C2 measurements of CyA could result in an even better method to avoid overimmunosuppression. On the other hand, generic alternatives of CyA could potentially reduce costs to transplant recipients as well as to the general community. Since the initiation of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and rapamycin, slow but expanding variations of immunosuppressive protocols have taken place. Transplantation medicine is thus becoming an increasingly exciting and innovative field, in which CyA continues to play a central role as the core immunosuppressant of choice for the majority of patients. "
"Abstract: Since 1983, cyclosporine has been the backbone of immunosuppression in clinical organ transplantation. Cyclosporine is usually used in combination with steroids and with another second-line immunosuppressant like azathioprine or mycofenolate mofetil. With these regimens, graft survival at 1 year exceeds 90% and long-term results are excellent. The main complication is renal toxicity, which is usually secondary to excessive exposure. The new microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine, introduced in recent years, has improved intestinal absorption and bioavailability and resulted in much less intrapatient variation than the older formulation. The introduction of 2-hour peak blood level monitoring, which corresponds closely to the area under the curve of the drug, allows more appropriate dosing, thus minimizing rejection owing to underexposure or toxicity owing to overexposure. As new effective immunosuppressants are currently becoming available for use in combination with cyclosporine, the transplant community can look forward to more effective and safer immunosuppression. "
"Abstract: The introduction of cyclosporine (CyA) was a landmark in transplantation, and in the two decades that have followed, enormous experience has been acquired in its use. This has led to both an understanding of its mechanism, pharmacokinetics and toxicity, and the continued evolution of its clinical application. Many of the initial complexities related to the hydrophobic nature of the molecule, and its variable absorption were addressed by the introduction of the microemulsion formulation Neoral. Despite this, the therapeutic window for CyA remains narrow, and therapeutic drug monitoring, recognized early after its introduction, is essential. However, this too has been redefined with single-point, 2-hour, postdose monitoring being demonstrated to correlate better with dose and outcome than the traditional 12-hour trough level. Implementation of such techniques may impact on efficacy and the long-term effects of nephrotoxicity. The need to gain experience with new facets of CyA is likely to continue. In particular, the use of reduced doses to minimize nephrotoxicity during long-term management has produced favorable early results. Furthermore, in the near future the availability of generic CyA formulations will increase. It cannot be assumed that these will be bioequivalent to the current preparations, and modifications of therapy, outside of current experience, may be required. However, if 20 years of CyA usage has taught us anything, it is that different formulations may have very different biological behavior, and at least this situation can be approached with a caution gained from long experience. "
"Abstract: With the advent of cyclosporine (CsA) 20 years ago, graft survival increased considerably to more than 80% at 2 years posttransplant. The early formulation of CsA, Sandimmun, is effective in preventing organ rejection, although its absorption profile means it is subject to a high degree of variability. The development of a microemulsion formulation, Neoral, provided a therapy with superior efficacy in kidney, liver, and heart transplantation with an improved pharmacokinetic profile. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), including CsA, have a narrow therapeutic range, so frequent blood measurements to control drug levels are required. Recent research has demonstrated that the measurement of blood CsA concentration at 2 hours postdosing--C2 monitoring--has the potential to optimize efficacy and reduce the side effects associated with CNI use. In heart and de novo kidney transplantation, C2 monitoring may help to further reduce the incidence of acute rejection, while in maintenance renal transplant recipients, C2 monitoring can help to detect overexposure and thus allows safe dose reduction, which may improve blood pressure and renal function. C2 monitoring thus facilitates a better balance between effective Neoral immunosuppression and unwanted side effects. Today, CsA remains the cornerstone of immunosuppression, and ongoing studies aim to further optimize patient management strategies with Neoral. With other trials evaluating the impact of Neoral in combination with newer therapies such as Certican, myfortic, and FTY720, the use of CsA in transplant recipients looks set to continue. "
"Abstract: Cyclosporine (CsA) is currently the basis of most immunosuppressive protocols after solid organ transplantation. The introduction of Neoral, a new microemulsion formulation of CsA, and more recently a range of adjunctive immunosuppressants have further enhanced short-term efficacy and tolerability of CsA-based immunosuppression. In addition, Neoral C2 monitoring has been shown to have advantages not only in the early posttransplant period, but also for maintenance transplant patients. The major long-term disadvantage associated with CsA is the development of nephrotoxicity and chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN), which is the second major cause of graft failure. Thus, strategies to reduce the risk of CAN include CsA-sparing protocols, use of C2 level monitoring, introduction of non-nephrotoxic adjunctive immunosuppressants, and optimal management of additional risk factors. Other important side effects related to CsA-based immunosuppression include hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Optimal management of these conditions may lead to significant reduction of cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality following solid organ transplantation. "
"Abstract: The introduction of cyclosporine (CsA) into clinical practice resulted in a dramatic reduction in the incidence and severity of acute rejection. As a result, short-term and medium-term kidney allograft survival increased greatly. However, the long-term patient and graft survival have not improved to a similar degree. This can partly be attributed to the side effects of CsA and partly to the fact that the use of CsA has not led to a reduced incidence of chronic allograft nephropathy. Thus, there has been a continuing search for strategies that minimize CsA toxicity but maintain adequate immunosuppression. This has resulted in the development of the CsA microemulsion formulation and improved methods for therapeutic drug monitoring. With the introduction of newer immunosuppressive drugs, early CsA withdrawal and CsA-free immunosuppressive therapy have become feasible. However, CsA weaning or complete avoidance is associated with a slightly higher risk of acute rejection, and the long-term efficacy and safety of such strategies remain to be established. Therefore, it is to be expected that in the near future CsA will remain part of the standard immunosuppressive regimen in many transplant centers. "
"Abstract: Psoriasis is a multifactorial, chronically relapsing, inflammatory skin disease occurring in 1-3% of the world's population. Vitamin D3 analogs have effects on proliferation and differentiation, as well as on the infiltration and activation of neutrophils and immunocytes in psoriatic skin lesions. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of topical calcipotriol and to compare ointment and cream formulations in the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris. A total of 41 patients with mild to moderate psoriasis vulgaris (18 men and 23 women aged between 5 and 63 years) were enrolled in the study. Each patient was instructed to apply the treatment twice daily over the psoriatic lesions. Routine blood tests and serum calcium were performed prior to and at the end of treatment. Treatment assessment was carried out on weeks 2, 4 and 6 and was based on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score. Of the 41 patients included in our study, only 29 completed the treatment course. Their PASI before treatment ranged from 1.2 to 43 (mean: 12.1). Both groups, calcipotriol 50 microg/g ointment (11 patients) and calcipotriol 50 microg/g cream (18 patients) showed time-dependent improvement and after 6 weeks there was excellent improvement with a marked reduction in the total mean PASI from 12.1 to 1.02. There was a significant reduction of PASI in the ointment group in comparison with the cream group (mean PASI from 12.7 to 0.8 and 11.1 to 1.15, respectively). No significant adverse effects were observed in either group, except for mild irritation in a few patients in the calcipotriol cream group. In conclusion, calcipotriol was effective, safe and well tolerated in the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris and better results were observed with the ointment formulation. Longer treatment courses could be advised. "
"Abstract: Pimecrolimus (SDZ ASM 981, Elidel ) is an ascomycin macrolactam derivative and a cell-selective inhibitor of inflammatory cytokines specifically developed to treat inflammatory skin diseases. Pimecrolimus combines high anti-inflammatory activity in the skin with a low potential to impair systemic immune reactions. Multi-centre studies have proved the efficacy and safety of pimecrolimus cream in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and confirmed that it is suitable for short-term treatment and long-term management of AD in adults, children and infants as young as 3 months. Topical application in humans is not associated with the atrophogenic side effects observed with corticosteroids. Pimecrolimus blood levels remained consistently low after repeated topical application and no clinically relevant drug-related systemic adverse events have been reported among the 8000 patients treated in clinical trials so far. Short-term, Phase I/II and Phase II trials of pimecrolimus administered orally in psoriasis and AD have shown that this drug is highly effective in a dose-dependent manner in patients with these diseases and has high safety profile. This finding is confirmed by pharmacogenomic blood analysis. Available data thus indicates that pimecrolimus, in both the cream and oral formulations, may represent a new option for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases. "
"Abstract: Biodegradable vegetable-derived lubricants (VDL) might be less toxic to marine organisms than mineral-derived oils (MDL) due to the absence of high molecular weight aromatics, but this remains largely untested. In this laboratory study, adult corals and coral gametes were exposed to various concentrations of a two-stroke VDL-1A and a corresponding MDL to determine which lubricant type was more toxic to each life stage. In the fertilization experiment, gametes from the scleractinian coral Acropora microphthalma were exposed to water-accommodated fractions (WAF) of VDL-1A and MDL for four hours. The MDL and VDL-1A WAFs inhibited normal fertilization of the corals at 200 microg l(-1) total hydrocarbon content (THC) and 150 microg l(-1) THC respectively. Disturbance of a stable coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis is regarded as a valid measure of sub-lethal stress in adult corals. The state of the symbiosis in branchlets of adult colonies of Acropora formosa was monitored using indicators such as dinoflagellate expulsion and dark-adapted photosystem II yields of dinoflagellate (using pulse amplitude modulation fluorescence). An effect on symbiosis was measurable following 48 h exposure to the lubricants at concentrations of 190 microg l(-1) and 37 microg l(-1) THC for the MDL and VDL-1A respectively. GC/MS revealed that the main constituent of the VDL-1A WAF was the compound coumarin, added by the manufacturer to improve odour. The fragrance containing coumarin was removed from the lubricant formulation and the toxicity towards adult corals re-examined. The coumarin-free VDL-2 exhibited significantly less toxicity towards the adult corals than all of the other oil types tested, with the only measurable effect being a slight but significant drop in photosynthetic efficiency at 280 microg l(-1).

"PURPOSE: To investigate a possible increased risk of esophageal obstruction among users of loratadine and pseudoephedrine (Claritin-D 24-Hour [C-D 24], the original, round, extended-release formulation) compared to two other tablet formulations of loratadine. METHODS: Pharmacy data of 12 managed care plans were screened to identify users in the three groups from 1 September 1996 to 31 December 1998. Users with a medical claim following their first loratadine prescription (Index prescription) indicating an esophageal obstruction or endoscopic procedure were considered claims-identified cases. Medical records were reviewed to validate case status. RESULTS: There were 233,901 users (61% female) and 245 claims-identified cases occurring within 30 days after the first prescription. The incidence rate per 10,000 users of claims-identified cases occurring on the Index prescription date was higher among C-D 24 users (IR = 1.4) than Claritin Regular (C-R) users (IR = 0.07; p < 0.002) or Claritin-D 12-Hour (C-D 12) users (IR = 0.3; p > 0.05). Medical record review of 15 claims-identified cases confirmed two cases of acute esophageal obstruction, both among C-D 24 users. CONCLUSIONS: Claims-based analysis suggested an increased risk of endoscopic procedures on the Index date among C-D 24 users compared to C-R users. However, after medical record review, the study did not provide conclusive evidence of an association between C-D 24 use and esophageal obstruction. This study highlights the importance of validating findings from claims data using medical records. "
"Abstract: With so many new peel preparations on the market today, the dermatologist must ask himself basic questions concerning the products. The most important question is directed to the medical literature rather than the advertising or marketing campaign so common among market-driven cosmetic products. Since all peeling agents--superficial, medium depth and deep--are derived from basic chemicals known to cause exfoliation, destruction and/or inflammation of skin in a controlled manner, the clinician must ask what is new and better about the product. Peeling agents, regardless of their proprietary new name, fall into chemical families. The clinical evaluation of these generic agents is well documented in our literature as to efficacy, technical care and safety. In addition, combinations of peeling agents have been presented in the dermatologic cosmetic literature with scientific clinical trials and histology. These include: 1) The Gordon-Baker phenol peel; 2) Combination medium depth peeling; 3) Glycolic acid formulations. It is the responsibility of the dermatologic surgeon to be in control of his chemicals and his products. It is thus necessary for him to understand all the products and the peel formulation and be sure it has undergone the test of objective scientific study with clear clinical evaluations and histology. Only then will we truly know the effectiveness of the agents we are using for exfoliating and resurfacing. "
"OBJECTIVE: To report a case of a severe dermatologic reaction at the infusion site, as well as at multiple distant sites, after paclitaxel administration. CASE SUMMARY: A 53-year-old white male with cancer of the base of the tongue was treated with paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 infused over 3 hours and carboplatin dosed at an AUC of 6 mg/mL x min infused over 30 minutes via a peripheral vein on the left arm. After 4 doses of paclitaxel, the patient developed erythematous patches on both forearms and both thighs. The lesions on the left arm worsened into a necrotic ulcer, exposing underlying tissues. All of the lesions healed after paclitaxel was withheld from subsequent cycles. Based on the Naranjo probability scale, it is probable that paclitaxel was the causative agent for these lesions. DISCUSSION: Most of the previously reported paclitaxel-induced dermatologic reactions occurred following extravasation. There are few reports of generalized dermatologic rashes. These rashes are thought to be due to delayed hypersensitivity either to paclitaxel or the solubilizing agents. Our patient had dermatologic toxicity at the infusion site, as well as at multiple other sites, that developed about 6 weeks after the first paclitaxel infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Generalized dermatologic toxicity after paclitaxel administration is uncommon and seems to be immunologically mediated. This toxicity could be secondary to paclitaxel or the additives. The use of paclitaxel is increasing in various malignancies. Newer formulations are under development. Until these formulations are available, clinicians should report any dermatologic reactions in order to identify the cause of toxicity and develop safer administration technique. "
"Abstract: KSA (Ep-CAM) is highly expressed by colorectal cancers. The safety and immunologic effects of a vaccine consisting of recombinant baculovirus-derived KSA formulated with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) in liposomes and emulsified in mineral oil were evaluated, with and without co-administration of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Eleven patients with metastatic colorectal cancer received three subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of the vaccine at 4-week intervals. Six patients were randomized to also receive human recombinant GM-CSF (rGM-CSF) by subcutaneous injection daily for 4 days with each vaccination. Immunizations with and without rGM-CSF were well tolerated. Seven of the 11 patients developed significant KSA-specific cellular immune responses as assessed by lymphoproliferation and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) ELISPOT assays. All nine tested patients developed positive delayed type hypersensitivity reactions. Eight of the 11 patients developed KSA-specific antibody responses. The highest levels of cellular immune responses were observed in patients who received GM-CSF. Immunization with baculovirus-derived KSA formulated with monophosphoryl lipid A in liposomal emulsion is safe and can elicit KSA-specific immune responses. Co-administration of GM-CSF with this formulation is an effective method of generating KSA-specific T-helper (Th) 1-associated cellular immune responses. "
"Abstract: The findings of this investigation thus conclusively demonstrate the promising role of concomitant therapy of liposomal TRE and BP gels in treating acne patients. Allthough their use improved the therapeutic response, more benefits of the liposomal form of drugs were observed in terms of reduction in adverse effects of therapy, thus fostering better patient compliance. It can be concluded that this study underscores the potential utility of concomitant therapy with liposomal TRE and BP gels in the treatment of acne. However, the role of liposmal formulations may only be established after clinical evaluation of alarge number of patients, with a special focus on the adverse symptoms of therapy. "
"BACKGROUND: Sulfur mustard and VX are potent chemical warfare agents that penetrate rapidly through the skin, causing severe prolonged injuries and sometimes death. OBJECTIVES: To develop a topically applied pretreatment that will act as a barrier and prevent the absorption of these agents through the skin, reducing morbidity and saving life. METHODS: Several formulations were developed and tested in preclinical animal studies in pigs. The protecting cream was applied as a single application (0.5-1 ml/100 cm2) prior to exposure (10 minutes to 12 hours) to sulfur mustard or VX. Assessment of sulfur mustard-induced skin damage was based on clinical and histologic evaluations. When tested against VX, clinical signs and blood cholinesterase activity were monitored. At the final stage of development, safety studies were conducted in animals and in human volunteers. RESULTS: The formulation that gave the best results, coded IB1 (under patent application), provided significant protection against a 1 hour exposure to sulfur mustard (droplets or vapor). All the pigs pretreated with IB1 cream survived a 1-4 hour challenge of 2xLD50 VX and did not exhibit any overt clinical signs. Protection was exhibited even when the cream was applied 12 hours (single application) prior to exposure. IB1 was found to be non-irritating in animals and humans. No adverse effects were found in a Phase I clinical study in young healthy volunteers when the cream was applied to around 20% of the skin surface (results presented elsewhere). CONCLUSIONS: IB1 cream has been shown to be a safe and effective topical skin protectant against the chemical warfare agents sulfur mustard and VX. "
"Abstract: Thirty-one subjects (8 males and 23 females; mean age, 49.8 years) were enrolled in a single-center study to assess the irritancy potential of adapalene (Differin cream 0.1% and Differin gel 0.1%) and tretinoin (Avita cream 0.025%, Retin-A cream 0.025%, Retin-A cream 0.05%, Retin-A Micro gel 0.1%, and generic cream 0.025%) as compared with white petrolatum when applied under occlusive conditions. All test materials were applied randomly under occlusion to sites located on the upper area of the subject's back under protective patches. All patches were applied to the same sites unless the degree of reaction to a test product or the adhesive necessitated removal (grade 3). Each test material was applied daily, Monday through Friday, for approximately 24 hours, with the Friday patches left in place over the weekend. Twenty-six of the 31 subjects (84%) completed the study. No subject discontinued because of an adverse event. Five subjects voluntarily discontinued the study early for reasons unrelated to study treatment (4 subject request and 1 lost to follow-up). In the statistical comparison of the 7 test products, the mean cumulative irritancy index of both adapalene cream 0.1% and gel 0.1% was statistically significantly (P<.05) lower than for all of the tretinoin products used and was not significantly higher than the negative control product (white petrolatum). "
"BACKGROUND: Originally developed to protect against sunburn, sunscreen has been assumed to prevent skin cancer. However, conflicting reports include claims that sunscreen increases risk for melanoma. OBJECTIVE: To examine the strength and consistency of associations between melanoma and sunscreen use in the published literature. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive MEDLINE search of articles published from 1966 to 2003 that reported information on sunscreen use and melanoma in humans. STUDY SELECTION: Analytic studies reporting data on sunscreen use before diagnosis of melanoma. DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent reviewers extracted data. Inconsistencies were rereviewed until agreement was achieved. When necessary, a third party resolved discrepancies. DATA SYNTHESIS: Odds ratios were pooled across studies by using standard meta-analytic techniques. Pooled odds ratios for ever use among 18 heterogeneous studies did not support an association between melanoma and sunscreen use. Variation among odds ratios was explained by studies that did not adjust for confounding effects of sun sensitivity. The lack of a dose-response effect with frequency of use (never, sometimes, or always) or years of use provided further evidence of a null association. CONCLUSIONS: No association was seen between melanoma and sunscreen use. Failure to control for confounding factors may explain previous reports of positive associations linking melanoma to sunscreen use. In addition, it may take decades to detect a protective association between melanoma and use of the newer formulations of sunscreens. "
"Abstract: We describe a series of women after allogeneic stem cell transplantation with vaginal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) who were treated with topical cyclosporine, surgery, or both. We reviewed the medical charts of 11 women who presented with vaginal pain, discomfort, and vaginal scarring (inability to perform a Papanicolaou test or have vaginal intercourse because of pain). Vaginal symptoms develop an average of 10 months from bone marrow transplantation. Symptoms and physical findings include excoriated and ulcerated mucosa, thickened mucosa, narrowed introitus, and obliterated introitus from dense scar tissue that does not resolve with systemic or topical estrogens. The severity of symptoms and the physical findings in our study population did not correlate with age, type of leukemia, type of transplant, or severity or acute or chronic GVHD. Excoriated mucosa and moderately thickened mucosa were successfully treated with topical cyclosporine. Extensive synechiae and complete obliteration of the vaginal canal required surgical lysis with postoperative topical cyclosporine. Vaginal GVHD can successfully be treated with topical cyclosporine when mild to moderate disease is present. Surgical lysis with topical cyclosporine is required when more severe disease ensues. "
"Abstract: Most alpha-hydroxyacids and polyhydroxy acids are physiologic, natural, and nontoxic substances. All members of the group promote normal keratinization and desquamation. Those with multiple hydroxyl groups are moisturizing antioxidants, and are especially gentle for sensitive skin. Alpha-hydroxyacids and polyhydroxy acids can increase biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans and collagen fibers, and cause substantial skin plumping and increased dermal thickness. Formulation of alpha-hydroxyacids and polyhydroxy acids in combination with pharmaceutical agents can enhance efficacy and diminish or eliminate side effects and drug resistance. N-acetylamino sugars and N-acetylamino acids are two other categories of physiologic substances that can: 1) increase skin thickness; 2) improve wrinkles and photoaged skin; and 3) eradicate itch in senile and eczematous dermatitis. "
"Abstract: Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and pseudoephedrine (PSE) are often administered together for the treatment of symptoms of the common cold, i.e., nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat and headache. Based on this fact we developed a fixed combination of 500 mg ASA and 30 mg PSE, the recommended doses for both drugs for treating symptoms of the common cold, as granulate to be dissolved in water for administration. The purpose of this open, randomized, three-factorial (three-treatment, three-period, six-sequence) Latin Square clinical study was to investigate the relative bioavailability of ASA and PSE as well as the establishment of bioequivalence after single administration of the fixed combination (final formulation for approval) of 500 mg ASA/30 mg PSE*HCl and the preliminary formulation of this combination. Pharmacokinetic characteristics AUC(norm) and C(max,norm) of ASA, its metabolite SA, and PSE, were determined as measure of rate and extent of absorption of the two formulations. The treatment ratios final/preliminary formulation and their corresponding 90% confidence intervals were calculated to establish bioequivalence. Additionally, descriptive statistics were calculated for the parameters t(max), t((1/2)), and mean residence time (MRT). In total, data from 18 healthy male volunteers were included in the pharmacokinetic evaluation. The primary target parameters were analyzed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) after logarithmic transformation of the data. Confidence intervals of 90% were calculated for the geometric means of ratios using the mean square error term of the ANOVA. Bioequivalence criteria were fulfilled for AUC(norm) and C(max,norm). Geometric means of individual ratios of AUC(norm) and of C(max,norm) showed equal bioavailability of the new formulation compared with the preliminary. Furthermore, a relative bioavailability of approximately 100% of the preliminary formulation was shown for the newly developed formulation for all parameters. The parameters t(max), t((1/2)), and MRT showed comparable results for ASA, SA, and PSE, respectively, in both formulations. The supplementary evaluation for the non-normalized original parameters AUC and C(max) also revealed bioequivalence. For the newly developed formulation, the arithmetic means of the parameters AUC and C(max) for PSE were 1040.66 mg/h*l and 134.52 mg/l, for SA 142.28 mg/h*l and 30.34 mg/l, respectively. The median t(max) values were 0.67 h for PSE and 0.92 h for SA. Both treatments were safe and well tolerated. "
"Abstract: By using a rational formulation approach, we have tried to find the general characteristics for promising self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) based on natural lipid components, for the oral delivery of lipophilic drugs. Galactolipids, which are polar lipids commonly found in the chloroplast membranes of green plants, and a natural part of the human diet, were the main surfactants in these formulations. This was done in three clinical studies: a screening study, followed by a prediction study and, finally, a confirmatory study; in all 17 experimental formulations were investigated. The clinical trials were performed in healthy volunteers. Cyclosporine, a well-known lipophilic peptide, was incorporated in different SEDDS, and administered orally, followed by the measurement of the blood concentration of the drug over time. The pharmacokinetic parameters, which describe the rate and extent of absorption, were estimated. We found that fractionated oat oil (FOO) and medium chain monoglycerides (60:30:10 mono-, di- and tri-glycerides) promoted absorption, and resulted in a formulation with absorption characteristics nearly equal to the commercial formulation of cyclosporine, Sandimmun Neoral.

"Abstract: Linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) is added to cutting fluid formulations to enhance the performance of metal machining operations, but this surfactant can cause contact dermatitis in workers involved in these operations. The purpose of this study was to determine how cutting fluid additives influence dermal disposition of 14C-LAS in mineral oil- or polyethylene glycol 200 (PEG)-based mixtures when topically applied to silastic membranes and porcine skin in an in vitro flow-through diffusion cell system. 14C-LAS mixtures were formulated with three commonly used cutting fluid additives; 0 or 2% triazine (TRI), 0 or 5% triethanolamine (TEA), and 0 or 5% sulfurized ricinoleic acid (SRA). LAS absorption was limited to less than a 0.5% dose and the additives in various combinations influenced the physicochemical characteristics of the dosing mixture. LAS was more likely to partition into the stratum corneum (SC) in mineral oil mixtures, and LAS absorption was significantly greater in the complete mixture. TRI enhanced LAS transport, and the presence of SRA decreased LAS critical micelle concentration (CMC) which reduced LAS monomers available for transport. TEA increased mixture viscosity, and this may have negated the apparent enhancing properties of TRI in several mixtures. In summary, physicochemical interactions in these mixtures influenced availability of LAS for absorption and distribution in skin, and could ultimately influence toxicological responses in skin. "
"Abstract: The significant inhibitory action of diclofenac formulated in mixed micelles of lecithin with cholate or deoxycholate was observed on the rat hind paw edema induced by carrageenan. In the primary stage, mixed micelle formulation of deoxycholate was more effective compared with that of cholate. However, in the final term, the inhibitory action was similar in both formulations. In a previous study, the flux of diclofenac was greater in the mixed micelle formulation of deoxycholate compared with that of cholate. It was suggested that the permeation rate of diclofenac through skin was proportional to the pharmacological activity. The hind paw edema was quickly inhibited when cyclic monoterpene such as d-limonene or l-menthol was included in the formulations. All the micelle formulations significantly decreased the value of AUC estimated the hind paw thickness-time profile. This suggests that the micelle formulation of cholate in addition to deoxycholate showed significant anti-inflammatory activity to hind paw edema of rats. Incorporation of d-limonene or l-menthol was more effective on the decrease of AUC. A pharmacological study revealed that micelle formulations were able to reduce the skin irritation of chemicals. "
"OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of a novel formulation of 15% azelaic acid gel (Finacea; Berlex Laboratories, Inc, Montville, NJ) with 0.75% metronidazole gel (MetroGel; Galderma Laboratories LP, Fort Worth, Tex) as topical therapy for moderate, papulopustular facial rosacea. DESIGN: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study. SETTING: Thirteen US centers. PATIENTS: A total of 251 patients with papulopustular rosacea with persistent erythema and telangiectasia. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive azelaic acid gel or metronidazole gel twice daily for 15 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Nominal and percent change in inflammatory lesion count, change in erythema and telangiectasia severity ratings, investigator's global assessment of rosacea, and investigator's and patient's overall improvement ratings. RESULTS: Azelaic acid gel was superior to metronidazole gel in reduction of mean nominal lesion count (-12.9 vs -10.7, respectively) (P =.003) and mean percent decrease in inflammatory lesions (-72.7% vs -55.8%, respectively) (P<.001). With respect to erythema severity, 56% of azelaic acid gel-treated patients were rated improved vs 42% of metronidazole gel-treated patients (P =.02). The effectiveness of metronidazole gel on these variables seemed to plateau after week 8, whereas azelaic acid gel demonstrated progressive improvement through week 15. Neither treatment had a clinically appreciable effect on telangiectasia. Both the investigator's global assessment (P =.02) and overall assessment of improvement (P =.005) showed a significant therapeutic advantage for azelaic acid gel. Azelaic acid gel also scored higher on the patient's overall assessment of efficacy. Both treatments were rated as having high cosmetic acceptability. No serious or systemic treatment-related adverse events were reported in either group. CONCLUSION: Use of 15% azelaic acid gel twice daily for 15 weeks demonstrated significant superiority over using 0.75% metronidazole gel in improving principal signs of rosacea (inflammatory lesions and erythema). "
"Abstract: Pimecrolimus (Elidel, SDZ ASM 981), a new macrolactam ascomycin derivative, was highly effective in treating plaque-type psoriasis when applied under Finn-chamber occlusion. A two-centre, randomized, double-blind, vehicle- and positive-controlled within-patient study was therefore conducted in 23 adult psoriasis patients. Pimecrolimus 1% was applied, twice daily, in an experimental ointment formulation, along with the corresponding vehicle, 0.005% calcipotriol ointment and 0.05% clobetasol-17-propionate ointment to test sites without occlusion for 21 days. Erythema, induration and scaling (score: 0 [absent] to 4 [severe]) were evaluated. The total sign score was defined as the sum of the erythema, induration and scaling scores (range 0-12). Pimecrolimus 1% ointment was significantly (p = 0.03) more effective than the corresponding vehicle, with an improvement in total sign score of 51.4% compared with 36.7% for the corresponding vehicle. Improvements with calcipotriol and clobetasol-17-propionate were 71.5% and 88.3%, respectively. No local or systemic drug-related side effects were observed in the study. We conclude that pimecrolimus 1% in the experimental ointment formulation was significantly more effective than its corresponding vehicle, but less effective than calcipotriol and clobetasol ointment. This is the first study reporting a significant therapeutic effect of pimecrolimus in an ointment formulation applied without occlusion to psoriatic plaques. "
"Abstract: Systemic administration of cyclosporine A (CsA) is commonly used in the treatment of local ophthalmic conditions involving cytokines, such as corneal graft rejection, autoimmune uveitis and dry eye syndrome. Local administration is expected to avoid the various side effects associated with systemic delivery. However, the currently available systems using oils to deliver CsA topically are poorly tolerated and provide a low bioavailability. These difficulties may be overcome through formulations aimed at improving CsA water solubility (e.g. cyclodextrins), or those designed to facilitate tissue drug penetration using penetration enhancers. The use of colloidal carriers (micelles, emulsions, liposomes and nanoparticles) as well as the approach using hydrosoluble prodrugs of CsA have shown promising results. Solid devices such as shields and particles of collagen have been investigated to enhance retention time on the eye surface. Some of these topical formulations have shown efficacy in the treatment of extraocular diseases but were inefficient at reaching intraocular targets. Microspheres, implants and liposomes have been developed to be directly administered subconjunctivally or intravitreally in order to enhance CsA concentration in the vitreous. Although progress has been made, there is still room for improvement in CsA ocular application, as none of these formulations is ideal. "
"Abstract: Cyclosporin A pharmacokinetics was studied in rats with cisplatin-induced acute renal failure (ARF) using microemulsion preconcentrate (MEPC) and completely dissolved formulations. Although the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporin A was unchanged after intravenous administration, maximum concentration of cyclosporin A in ARF rats was significantly reduced to 608+/-62 and 999+/-189 ng/ml compared with 1720+/-142 and 1832+/-250 ng/ml in controls after oral administration of MEPC and completely dissolved formulations, respectively. In an in situ intestinal loop sac study, the amount absorbed plus metabolized and the blood concentration of cyclosporin A were similar between control and ARF rats, and taurocholic acid, one of the bile acids, significantly increased absorption of cyclosporin A using the MEPC formulation in both control and ARF rats; the amount absorbed plus metabolized with taurocholic acid was increased to 137 and 186%, and simultaneously the blood concentration was increased to 155 and 158% of that without taurocholic acid in control and ARF rats, respectively. The bile flow in ARF rats was decreased compared with that in controls. These results suggested that renal dysfunction decreased the absorption of cyclosporin A in spite of the MEPC formulation, and the alternation of bile secretion partly affected the absorption rate of cyclosporin A in the gastrointestinal tract.

"Abstract: Testing for phototoxic hazard is usually carried out for product ingredients intended for use on skin, which may be exposed to sunlight. Unilever currently uses the validated in vitro 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake phototoxicity test (NRU PT). This protocol involves 2-3 experiments, each taking 3 days to perform. One person can test up to seven test materials plus positive control at any one time, requiring approximately 0.5 g test material. Higher throughput is required where libraries of potential actives are being generated and screening for potential phototoxicants is required. A proposed HTS protocol would use the NRU PT, but only one concentration (10 microg/ml) in a single experiment. The validity of the HTS protocol was investigated by a retrospective examination of data from 86 materials previously tested. Phototoxic hazard predictions made using the conventional NRU PT were compared with those obtained if only data at 10 microg/ml were considered. A majority of 73 materials (84.9%) gave agreement in predictions between the two protocols; for 13 materials (15.1%) the assessments did not agree. There were no false positives; however, there were some false negatives, i.e., predicted as phototoxic from the conventional assay, but non-phototoxic at 10 microg/ml. As this protocol is intended for screening purposes only it is considered that this would be acceptable at this stage in material selection. One person could screen 128 test materials in 3 days, requiring <1 mg test material, giving a substantial increase in productivity. Any material selected for further development and inclusion in a formulation may require further confirmatory testing, e.g. using a human skin model assay for phototoxicity. "
"Abstract: Brimonidine is a potential first line therapy for primary open angle glaucoma (OAG) and ocular hypertension (OHT). It is known to cause various ocular and systemic side effects. Being a newer drug, the whole spectrum of its adverse effects is not known. The dermatological side effects caused by brimonidine have rarely been reported before. We present three OAG patients who presented to us with contact dermatitis of periorbital skin and lichen planus of nail following the use of topical brimonidine (0.2% twice a day) for more than six months. These side effects slowly disappeared on discontinuing the drug but reappeared on reintroducing topical formulation. Such side effects from the use of brimonidine have not been reported before. "
"Abstract: TNFalpha is a crucial cytokine in the establishment and maintenance of inflammation in multiple autoimmune diseases. With the introduction of infliximab and etanercept, two injectable biologic TNFalpha blocking drugs are now available. Both are effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, reducing clinical inflammation and damage to bones. In addition, infliximab is FDA-approved for the treatment of Crohn's disease. More recent controlled trials have shown effectiveness for TNFalpha blockers in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Further trials are underway in diverse inflammatory conditions including including uveitis, sarcoidosis, Behcet's syndrome, and graft versus host disease. Although the safety profile has been generally excellent, the rare development of reactivation tuberculosis, anti double-stranded DNA antibodies, or a demyelination syndrome point out the need for further close follow-up of treated patients. New formulations of recombinant anti-TNFalpha biologics undergoing clinical trials use modifications to reduce antigenicity, increase the half-life, and maintain or extend the efficacy of these agents. Future development of TNFalpha antagonists is turning to small molecule inhibitors. The inhibition of the TNFalpha signaling cascade is under study using blockers of the p38, JNK, and ERK kinases, and by antagonists of transcription factor NF-kappaB activation. The goal of this approach is to develop compounds that are orally available, have increased selectivity compared to generalized blockade of TNFalpha, yet are therapeutically useful for a range of chronic inflammatory diseases. "
"Abstract: Early subchronic and chronic inhalation toxicology studies on various petroleum mineral oils and formulated lubricants supported the ACGIH TLV of 5 mg/m(3) for mineral oil mist. Additional subchronic studies with aerosolized mineral base oils and lubricants during the last 15 years demonstrated that exposures to aerosols of mineral base oils (often >100 mg/m(3)) resulted mainly in concentration-related accumulation in the lung of alveolar macrophages laden with oil droplets. Inflammatory cells were observed with higher aerosol concentrations, consistent with the clinical literature from highly exposed workers. These pulmonary changes appeared to be a nonspecific response to the presence of deposited aerosol. Studies on sensory irritation during exposures of lab animals to mineral oils indicate possible effects only with very high aerosol concentrations. Coupled with changes in refining to remove carcinogenic polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons from mineral oils several decades ago, this information indicates that current aerosols of mineral oils have a profile of low toxicity from acute to long-term exposures. Available information suggests that additives in some formulated products and/or maintenance of mineral-based metalworking fluids may play a much more significant role in potential health effects. "
"Abstract: Sodium Sulfite, Ammonium Sulfite, Sodium Bisulfite, Potassium Bisulfite, Ammonium Bisulfite, Sodium Metabisulfite, and Potassium Metabisulfite are inorganic salts that function as reducing agents in cosmetic formulations. All except Sodium Metabisulfite also function as hair-waving/straightening agents. In addition, Sodium Sulfite, Potassium Sulfite, Sodium Bisulfite, and Sodium Metabisulfite function as antioxidants. Although Ammonium Sulfite is not in current use, the others are widely used in hair care products. Sulfites that enter mammals via ingestion, inhalation, or injection are metabolized by sulfite oxidase to sulfate. In oral-dose animal toxicity studies, hyperplastic changes in the gastric mucosa were the most common findings at high doses. Ammonium Sulfite aerosol had an acute LC(50) of >400 mg/m(3) in guinea pigs. A single exposure to low concentrations of a Sodium Sulfite fine aerosol produced dose-related changes in the lung capacity parameters of guinea pigs. A 3-day exposure of rats to a Sodium Sulfite fine aerosol produced mild pulmonary edema and irritation of the tracheal epithelium. Severe epithelial changes were observed in dogs exposed for 290 days to 1 mg/m(3) of a Sodium Metabisulfite fine aerosol. These fine aerosols contained fine respirable particle sizes that are not found in cosmetic aerosols or pump sprays. None of the cosmetic product types, however, in which these ingredients are used are aerosolized. Sodium Bisulfite (tested at 38%) and Sodium Metabisulfite (undiluted) were not irritants to rabbits following occlusive exposures. Sodium Metabisulfite (tested at 50%) was irritating to guinea pigs following repeated exposure. In rats, Sodium Sulfite heptahydrate at large doses (up to 3.3 g/kg) produced fetal toxicity but not teratogenicity. Sodium Bisulfite, Sodium Metabisulfite, and Potassium Metabisulfite were not teratogenic for mice, rats, hamsters, or rabbits at doses up to 160 mg/kg. Generally, Sodium Sulfite, Sodium Metabisulfite, and Potassium Metabisulfite were negative in mutagenicity studies. Sodium Bisulfite produced both positive and negative results. Clinical oral and ocular-exposure studies reported no adverse effects. Sodium Sulfite was not irritating or sensitizing in clinical tests. These ingredients, however, may produce positive reactions in dermatologic patients under patch test. In evaluating the positive genotoxicity data found with Sodium Bisulfite, the equilibrium chemistry of sulfurous acid, sulfur dioxide, bisulfite, sulfite, and metabisulfite was considered. This information, however, suggests that some bisulfite may have been present in genotoxicity tests involving the other ingredients and vice versa. On that basis, the genotoxicity data did not give a clear, consistent picture. In cosmetics, however, the bisulfite form is used at very low concentrations (0.03% to 0.7%) in most products except wave sets. In wave sets, the pH ranges from 8 to 9 where the sulfite form would predominate. Skin penetration would be low due to the highly charged nature of these particles and any sulfite that did penetrate would be converted to sulfate by the enzyme sulfate oxidase. As used in cosmetics, therefore, these ingredients would not present a genotoxicity risk. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel concluded that Sodium Sulfite, Potassium Sulfite, Ammonium Sulfite, Sodium Bisulfite, Ammonium Bisulfite, Sodium Metabisulfite, and Potassium Metabisulfite are safe as used in cosmetic formulations.

"Abstract: Diisopropyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Dicetearyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Diisostearyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Dioctyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Dioctyldodecyl Dimer Dilinoleate, and Ditridecyl Dimer Dilinoleate are diesters of their respective alcohols and dilinoleic acid. They function as skin-conditioning agents in a variety of cosmetic products at concentrations around 10%, but may be used at concentrations up to 53% in lipsticks. These ingredients do not absorb radiation in the ultraviolet (UV) UVA or UVB range and the only impurities expected are <0.5% dilinoleic acid, <0.1% isopropyl alcohol or <1% isostearyl alcohol, and/or small amounts of dilinoleic acid and cetearyl alcohol or octyldodecanol, depending on which diester is used. The potential skin penetration of these ingredients was evaluated using an estimate of the octanol/water partition coefficient (logP of 17.7) based on the structure of Diisopropyl Dimer Dilinoleate. This is consistent with the insolubility of these ingredients in water. Safety test data on dilinoleic acid (no adverse effects) were considered relevant because dilinoleic acid is a component of these diesters and a likely breakdown product. The acute oral and dermal LD(50) values for rats of Diisopropyl, Diisostearyl, and Dioctyldodecyl Dimer Dilinoleate were >5.0 g/kg. In a subchronic feeding study, macrophage aggregation was seen in the mesenteric lymph node at the lowest dose level (0.1% in the diet). These ingredients did not produce skin or ocular irritation in animal tests, nor were they comedogenic. Ames testing, clastogenesis in human lymphocytes in culture, and L5178Y mouse lymphoma cell forward mutations were all negative, indicating no dilinoleic acid genotoxicity. No carcinogenicity or reproductive/developmental toxicity data were available; however, structural alerts that would suggest a mutagenic or carcinogenic risk are absent. Significant reproductive/developmental toxicity or other systemic toxicity is not expected with these ingredients because they remain on the skin surface. In clinical studies, cosmetic formulations containing these ingredients did not produce skin irritation or sensitization, although one report of sensitization to dilinoleic acid appeared in the case literature. The Panel did note that the concentration of use of Diisopropyl Dimer Dilinoleate was reportedly as high as 53% in lipsticks, but that the highest concentration tested for irritation/sensitization is 27%. Given the size of these molecules, their relative insolubility in water, their lipophilic nature, and the absence of any significant case reports of allergic reactions, a use concentration of 53% is not likely to be associated with any adverse effects. Accordingly, these diesters were considered safe as used in cosmetic products. "
"Abstract: Dimethicone is a fluid mixture of fully methylated linear siloxane polymers end-blocked with trimethylsiloxy units. Methicone is a linear monomethyl polysiloxane. The other dimethicones and methicones covered in this review are siloxane polymers of Dimethicone and Methicone. Most of these ingredients function as conditioning agents in cosmetic formulations at current concentrations of use of < or =15%. Clinical and animal absorption studies reported that Dimethicone was not absorbed following oral or dermal exposure. Dimethicone, Methicone, and Vinyldimethicone were not acutely toxic following oral exposure. No adverse reactions were found in rabbits following short-term dermal dosing with 6% to 79% Dimethicone, yet adverse effects were noted with a hand cream formulation containing 1% Dimethicone, suggesting something else in the preparation was toxic. Mice and rats were dosed for 90 days with up to 10% Dimethicone without adverse effect. Dimethicone did not produce adverse effects in acute and short-term inhalation-route studies, Methicone and Vinyldimethicone were negative in acute exposure studies using rats, but Hexyl Methicone was toxic to rats at 5 mg/L delivered in small particle (mean diameter of 0.29 micro) aerosols. Most dermal irritation studies using rabbits classified Dimethicone as a minimal irritant. Dimethicone (tested undiluted and at 79%) was not a sensitizer in four assays using mice and guinea pigs. It was not a sensitizer at 5.0% in a clinical repeated insult patch test using 83 panelists. Most ocular irritation studies using rabbits classified Dimethicone as a mild to minimal irritant. Dimethicone was tested in numerous oral-dose (using rats) and dermal-dose (using rats, rabbits, and monkeys) reproductive and developmental toxicity studies. In a few studies, treated males had significantly decreased body weight and/or decreased testes or seminal vesicles weights. No treatment-related adverse findings were noted in dosed pregnant females or fetuses. Dimethicone was negative in all genotoxicity assays. It was negative in both an oral (tested at 91%) and dermal (tested at an unknown concentration) dose carcinogenicity assay using mice. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel considered it unlikely that any of these polymers would be significantly absorbed into the skin due to their large molecular weight. Although adverse effects were noted in one inhalation study with small aerosol particles, the expected particle sizes for cosmetic products would primarily be in the range of 60 to 80 micro, and less than 1% would be under 10 micro, which is an upper limit for respirable particles. Overall, the safety test data support the safety of these ingredients at the concentrations they are known to be used in cosmetic formulations. Accordingly, the CIR Expert Panel was of the opinion that Stearoxy Dimethicone, Dimethicone, Methicone, Amino Bispropyl Dimethicone, Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Amodimethicone, Amodimethicone Hydroxystearate, Behenoxy Dimethicone, C24-28 Alkyl Methicone, C30-45 Alkyl Methicone, C30-45 Alkyl Dimethicone, Cetearyl Methicone, Cetyl Dimethicone, Dimethoxysilyl Ethylenediaminopropyl Dimethicone, Hexyl Methicone, Hydroxypropyldimethicone, Stearamidopropyl Dimethicone, Stearyl Dimethicone, Stearyl Methicone, and Vinyldimethicone are safe as used in cosmetic formulations.

"BACKGROUND: Transfersome is a drug delivery technology based on highly deformable, ultraflexible lipid vesicles which penetrate the skin when applied non-occlusively. OBJECTIVES: To assess the advantages of this carrier-based formulation in humans, the efficacy and the atrophogenic potential of triamcinolone acetonide (TAC) in Transfersome was compared with commercially available TAC-containing cream and ointment. METHODS: Healthy volunteers were enrolled in double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials with random study medication assignment to the test areas. RESULTS: A 10-fold lower dose of TAC in Transfersome(R) (2.5 micro g cm-2) was bioequivalent to 25 micro g cm-2 TAC in conventional formulations as measured by erythema suppression (cream: P = 0.01, ointment: P < 0.001). A skin blanching assay revealed different kinetics of the formulations, with a delayed onset of action of the Transfersome and ointment preparations. Ultrasonic measurements revealed a significantly reduced atrophogenic potential. There was a 12.1% reduction in skin thickness given by TAC in Transfersome compared with a 21.1% reduction given by a bioequivalent dose in TAC cream after a 6-week treatment period (P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Transfersome may significantly improve the risk-benefit ratio of topically applied glucocorticosteroids. "
"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: UVA protection of sunscreen formulations is becoming increasingly important especially because of recent investigations on the long-term skin damage associated with UVA light. The development of a new in vitro method to measure UVA protection performance made it possible to predict reliably the in vivo UVA protection performance of representative sunscreen formulations found presently in the European and US market (1). This study was performed in order to determine the applicability of the method developed by Wendel et al. (1) to photostable and photolabile filter combinations and in order to measure the influence of sample pre-irradiation on predicting the in vivo performance. This was done by subjecting six photostable and six photolabile filter combinations to a standard irradiation. Then the in vitro UVA protection afforded by each combination was measured and compared with the persistent pigment darkening (PPD) values determined in vivo. RESULTS: The results clearly showed that pre-irradiation does not affect the in vitro PPD factor of the photostable and photolabile samples in the same way. Almost identical values were determined for the stable filter combinations with and without pre-irradiation, whereas distinct reductions in the in vitro factors by as much as 93% were observed after irradiation in the group of less stable filter combinations. Comparison of the in vivo and in vitro PPD factors showed that all 12 samples comprise a homogeneous distribution with identical factors before irradiation. After pre-irradiation only the factors for the six less stable products were selectively reduced. The correlation with the data determined on the skin was clearly poorer for these products after irradiation. CONCLUSION: Overall, the results showed that pre-irradiation should not to be used for the assessment of UVA protection using this method. Furthermore, it can be assumed that normalizing the in vitro absorbance curves to the labelled SPF of the sunscreen will adequately take into account the photochemical behaviour of UV filters on the skin during sun exposure.

"PURPOSE: To determine single-and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of liposomal-all- trans -retinoic acid (Atragen) following intravenous and oral ATRA (Vesanoid) administration in healthy volunteers. METHODS: This was a randomized, prospective, open-label, parallel pharmacokinetic study in which 29 subjects were given 90 mg/m (2) i.v. liposomal (L)-ATRA (16 subjects) every other day or 45 mg/m (2) oral ATRA (13 subjects) daily over 15 days. Pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed on days 1, 9, and 15. RESULTS: Twenty-two subjects (11 in each group) completed the study and were evaluated. Area under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC(0, infinity)] and maximum plasma concentration (C(max) ) of ATRA did not decrease during the 15 days of L-ATRA treatment. However, the oral ATRA regimen resulted in a significant decrease in the AUC(0, infinity) and C(max) of 45.3% and 31.8%, respectively, on day 9 as compared with that to day 1 (p< 0.05). In addition, the mean AUC(0, infinity) was 13- and 22-fold greater for L-ATRA than for oral ATRA on days 1 and 9, respectively. Despite the significantly higher plasma concentrations after L-ATRA treatment, the side effects of each formulation were similar, except for dermal exfoliation, which was seen in 31% of the subjects after L-ATRA dosing, and abnormal liver function tests that were seen in 23% of the subjects after oral ATRA administration. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that i.v. administration of L-ATRA maintains higher and stable plasma ATRA concentrations than oral ATRA in healthy subjects after repetitive administration. L-ATRA with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile may have potential advantages over oral ATRA and may be more efficacious in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia or other retinoid-responsive cancers.

"BACKGROUND: There continues to be a need to develop new pharmacological approaches for treating the common skin disease psoriasis. Human skin produces parathyroid hormone related peptide. This peptide is a potent inhibitor of epidermal cell growth. OBJECTIVES: A programme was initiated to determine whether an agonist of this peptide's receptor, PTH (1-34), could be developed as a drug to treat psoriasis. METHODS: PTH (1-34) was formulated in Novasome A cream. Fifteen adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis who had failed to respond to at least one standard treatment were enrolled in a randomized double-blinded placebo self-controlled trial. The patients topically applied to a 25-cm2 psoriatic lesion 0.1 g of either Novasome A cream or Novasome A cream that contained 20 microg of PTH (1-34) twice a day for 2 months. At the end of the double-blind study, patients were enrolled in an open large area study. Ten patients applied PTH (1-34) (50 microg per 0.1 g) once daily to their psoriatic lesions. The patients were evaluated for their global improvement and calcium metabolism. RESULTS: Novasome A cream enhanced the percutaneous absorption of PTH (1-34) in human skin in comparison with formulations in propylene glycol or normal saline. Psoriatic lesions treated with PTH (1-34) showed marked improvement in scaling, erythema and induration. There was a 67.3% improvement in the global severity score for the lesion treated with PTH (1-34) compared with the placebo-treated lesion, which only showed a 17.8% improvement. Ten patients topically applied PTH (1-34) on all of their lesions in a stepwise manner. A Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score analysis of all the patients revealed improvement of 42.6% (P < 0.02). None of the patients experienced hypercalcaemia or hypercalciuria or developed any side-effect to the medication. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who were resistant to at least one standard therapy for psoriasis had a remarkable improvement in their psoriasis when they applied PTH (1-34) to their lesion(s). No untoward toxicity was observed in any of the subjects. This pilot study suggests that topical PTH (1-34) is a safe and effective novel therapy for psoriasis. "
"Abstract: Hydroquinone has been successfully used to treat hyperpigmentation disorders for many years. Recently, new formulations containing hydroquinone have become available, including Lustra and Lustra-AF (Medicis). These products also contain glycolic acid 2%, an active antioxidant system (ascorbyl palmitate and tocopherol acetate), and moisturizers. Lustra-AF also contains a broad-spectrum sunscreen. Alustra contains a stabilized, high-concentration of retinol. The above formulations inhibit melanogenesis, stimulate epidermal desquamation, inhibit free radical-mediated photodamage and restore the antioxidant reservoir. The addition of retinoids may facilitate epidermal penetration of hydroquinone and prevent its oxidation. Comparative studies have shown that these agents can be effective in reducing blotchiness, mottled hyperpigmentation, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and surface roughness. In addition, these formulations have been generally well tolerated with patients rarely reporting mild-to-moderate adverse events such as dryness, redness, or peeling of the skin. "
"BACKGROUND: There are important differences in CsA pharmacokinetics between adult and pediatric patients, such that pharmacokinetic data can not necessarily be extrapolated from the adult to the pediatric setting. Research in adult renal transplant patients has shown that adequate cyclosporin exposure (AUC0-4) in the first week post-transplant is important for successful clinical outcome, and that cyclosporin concentration at 2 h post-dose (C2) provides the optimal single-time point marker for AUC0-4. Clinically, dose management based on C2 level results in a low incidence of acute rejection in the adult renal transplant population. The study reported here undertook pharmacokinetic profiling in de novo renal transplant patients over a period of 6 months and retrospectively assessed alternative monitoring strategies based on pharmacokinetic findings and clinical outcomes. METHODS: This open-label, observational, prospective study was carried out at four UK transplant centers over a period of 6 months in pediatric de novo renal transplant recipients receiving the microemulsion formulation of cyclosporin (Neoral) according to local protocol. Twelve-hour pharmacokinetic profiles (8-16 blood samples each) were performed on days 5 and 14 and at weeks 4, 13 and 26 post-transplant. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were recruited (median age 10 yr, range 3-18 yr). At 6 months, patient survival was 100% and graft survival was 91%. The incidence of clinically determined acute rejection was 41% (13 of 32). Six patients discontinued Neoral before 6 months: three due to graft loss, one due to rejection, one due to renal toxicity and one due to hypertrichosis. At all time points studied, C2 correlated more closely with AUC0-4 and with AUC0-12 than did the pre-dose cyclosporin concentration (C0, or trough). Patients achieving C2 > 1.5 microg/mL by the fifth postoperative day experienced no acute rejection in the first 6 months, compared with a 50% rejection rate among patients with C2 < 1.5 microg/mL (P < 0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that C2 level >1.7 microg/mL was associated with approximately 90% probability of freedom from acute rejection. Analysis of renal function across patients grouped according to cyclosporine exposure (AUC0-4, C2) showed no adverse effects of higher/increased exposure on creatinine or GFR. CONCLUSIONS: C2 level provides a more reliable marker for CsA exposure than C0 in pediatric renal transplant recipients, and is more closely predictive of acute rejection risk. A C2 target of 1.7 microg/mL appears appropriate in this population during the immediate post-transplant period in order to maximize clinical benefit. "
"Abstract: Forty-two subjects with normal skin were enrolled in a single-center study to assess the cumulative irritancy potential of adapalene (Differin gel 0.1% and Differin solution 0.1%) compared with tazarotene (Tazorac gels 0.05% and 0.1%), tretinoin (Retin-A Micro gel 0.1%, Avita cream 0.025%, and Avita gel 0.025%), and white petrolatum (negative control). All test materials were applied randomly, under occlusion, to sites located on either side of the midline--the mid thoracic area of the subjects' backs. All patches were applied daily, Monday through Friday, to the same sites, unless the degree of reaction to a test product or adhesive necessitated removal (grade 3). Thirty-eight of the 42 subjects (90.5%) completed the study. Thirty-four of those 38 subjects (89.5%) had to discontinue using both tazarotene concentrations due to intolerance. Patch discontinuations for the remaining test materials were as follows: 7 subjects discontinued use of tretinoin microsphere gel 0.1%, 3 discontinued tretinoin cream 0.025%, 1 discontinued tretinoin gel 0.025%, and 1 discontinued adapalene gel 0.1%. None of the subjects discontinued use of the white petrolatum or the adapalene solution 0.1%. Adapalene gel and solution 0.1% were statistically (P<.01) less irritating than both tazarotene gels 0.1% and 0.05%, tretinoin microsphere gel 0.1%, and tretinoin gel 0.025%, and they were not statistically different from tretinoin gel 0.025%.

"Abstract: We report a case of occupational asthma due to hidden casein, contained in a dermatological powder. A 44 year old nurse reported the recent onset of rhinitis and asthma, clearly related to the work environment. Skin tests for food allergens revealed a positivity for milk proteins. The source of dispersed milk proteins in the work environment was found to be a dermatological formulation of an inert refreshing powder, used to treat excoriated areas in the elderly. Skin prick tests confirmed the positivity to casein and to the commercial product. "
"Abstract: Cyclosporine is being increasingly used in veterinary medicine. Oral formulations of the drug have found many therapeutic uses, but topical formulations have met with only limited success, probably owing to their poor penetration through the stratum corneum. The concurrent use of ketoconazole to inhibit cyclosporine metabolism has been shown to reduce the required dose and hence the cost of cyclosporine therapy. In human medicine, adverse reactions to the drug, especially nephrotoxicity, are common but in dogs given the commonly used oral dose of 5 mg/kg per day there have been few adverse reactions. However, no toxicity studies lasting longer than 12 months have been carried out in this species. This paper reviews the pharmacokinetics, drug and procedural interactions, contraindications and the adverse reactions to cyclosporine, with particular reference to its use in the treatment of dermatological conditions in dogs, cats and people. "
"Abstract: Liposomes have been prepared with a polymerised core. Drug release and gastrointestinal (GI) degradation of liposomes with this polymerised core was slightly less important than those of classical liposomes. Vincristine, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and methotrexate (MTX) have been incorporated into the liposomes, and studies carried out using the differentiated cell lines Caco-2 and TC7, and with 150 histologically normal sections of human colon. Encapsulation of the drugs in liposomes had variable effects, depending on the test system and the drug used. For 5-FU and MTX calculated to be in a therapeutic range, liposomal formulation enhanced drug permeation, but not for the other drugs tested. In the excised human colon model, the treatment history of the patients can affect bioavailability: pre-operative radiation increased the drug tissue uptake. Transmucosal transport of ions was modified by prior chemotherapy. These results should be taken into account in the design of oral anticancer treatments both at the level of nutritional and pharmacological considerations. "
"OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy and safety of fluticasone propionate, cream and ointment, applied twice weekly in addition to maintenance treatment with emollients, in reducing the risk of relapse of chronic recurrent atopic dermatitis. DESIGN: Randomised, double blind, parallel group study of 20 weeks' duration. SETTING: Dermatology outpatient clinics (6 countries, 39 centres). PARTICIPANTS: Adult (aged 12-65) patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who were experiencing a flare. METHODS: Participants applied fluticasone propionate (0.05% cream or 0.005% ointment; once or twice daily) regularly for four weeks to stabilise their condition. The patients whose disease was brought under control then continued into a 16 week maintenance phase, applying emollient on a daily basis with a bath oil as needed and either the same formulation of fluticasone propionate or its placebo base (emollient alone) twice weekly to the areas that were usually affected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Time to relapse of atopic dermatitis during maintenance phase. RESULTS: 376 patients entered the stabilisation phase, and 295 continued into the maintenance phase. After 16 weeks in the maintenance phase, the disease remained under control in 133 patients (87 using fluticasone propionate twice weekly, 46 using emollient alone), 135 (40 fluticasone propionate, 95 emollient) had experienced a relapse, and 27 had discontinued. Median time to relapse was six weeks for emollient alone compared with more than 16 weeks for additional fluticasone propionate. Patients who applied fluticasone propionate cream twice weekly were 5.8 times less likely (95% confidence interval 3.1 to 10.8, P < 0.001) and patients using fluticasone propionate ointment 1.9 times less likely (1.2 to 3.2, P=0.010) to have a relapse than patients applying emollient alone. The groups showed no differences in adverse events. CONCLUSION: After atopic dermatitis had been stabilised the addition of fluticasone propionate twice weekly to maintenance treatment with emollients significantly reduced the risk of relapse. "
"Abstract: Wavelength specific biological damage has been previously identified in human skin reconstructed in vitro. Sunburn cell and pyrimidine dimers were found after UVB exposure, and alterations of dermal fibroblasts after UVA exposure. These damages permitted us to discriminate UVB and UVA single absorbers. The present study shows that these biological effects can be obtained simultaneously by a combined UVB + UVA exposure using ultraviolet solar simulated light (UV-SSR), which represents a relevant UV source. In addition, the protection afforded by two broad spectrum sunscreen complex formulations was assessed after topical application. These two formulations displayed the same sun protection factor but different UVA protection factors determined by the persistent pigment darkening (PPD) method. Dose response experiments of UVA or UV-SSR showed that the preparation with the highest PF-UVA provided a better protection with regard to dermal damage compared to the other formulation. Using an original UVB source to obtain the UVB portion of SSR spectrum, the preparations provided the same protection. This study strikingly illustrates the fact that the photoprotection afforded by two sunscreen formulations having similar SPF values is not equal with regard to dermal damage related to photoaging.

"Abstract: Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), afflict an estimated one million Americans and produce symptoms that impair quality of life and ability to function. Progress in IBD management strategies has led to optimized approaches for achieving the two primary clinical goals of therapy: induction and maintenance of remission. Although surgery is indicated to treat refractory disease or specific complications, pharmacotherapy is the cornerstone of IBD management. The efficacy of aminosalicylates for induction of remission in mild to moderate UC and CD is well established, as is their role for maintenance of remission in UC. The sulfa-free mesalamine formulation offers an adverse effect profile similar to that of placebo, enabling the administration of higher, more effective doses. Although corticosteroids provide potent anti-inflammatory effects, their benefits are countermanded by the risk of intolerable and serious adverse effects, and they are ineffective for maintenance therapy. Other agents effective in inducing or maintaining remission are azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, infliximab, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and antibiotics. Ongoing clinical trials of experimental therapies will generate new tools for IBD treatment. Currently, a broad range of options allows physicians to tailor treatment to each patient's needs and preferences. Such considerations are essential for maximizing adherence to therapy. "
"Abstract: Retinoids have been in sharp focus ever since their introduction 30 years ago. They include any drug (s) that bind to retinoid receptors and elicit a biological response. Enormous information on the subject seems to embroil the recent literature. Practically it is impossible to clearly comprehend the undercurrents. The meticulously dispensing text envisages surmounting the perspective reader's predicaments. Accordingly, retinoids and their related facets namely retinoid receptors, classification, mode of action, and the pharmacological diversity have been precisely defined. Commonly used systemic retinoids too have been given a substantial fresh look along with their monitoring. Overall, adverse effects and relative and absolute contraindications have been scrupulously incorporated. Human immuno deficiency virus (HIV) and isoretinoid for acne, in particular, have been highlighted. Micronized isotretinoin formulations have also been taken care so also commonly used topical retinoids. Tretinoin and their newer formulation have also been accounted for along with tretinoin polymer cream. Adapalene, a new chemical entity possessing a unique physico-chemical activity similar to that of tretinoin has also been dealt with. Newer retinoids are likely to be a subject of intrigue. A focus on future potentials of retinoids is its special ingredient. The inclusion of details of rexinoid the most recent introduction in their purview is likely to invoke interest to further consolidate its reckoning in future. All in all the text of the paper should provide an insight into the current rumbling around retinoids. "
"Abstract: A 20-month-old girl with Alagille syndrome developed stenosis of hepatic venous anastomosis after living related-donor liver transplantation. Cyclosporin (a microemulsion formulation) was given orally at a dose of 50 mg twice daily, and the trough blood concentration was relatively stable. Before balloon angioplasty of the hepatic vein, trough cyclosporin blood concentrations became elevated and consequently, the dosage was reduced to 15 mg twice daily. On the day of angioplasty, the calculated elimination rate constant of cyclosporin was 0.036 hr(-1), while its apparent basal value was 0.078 hr(-1). The cyclosporin trough concentration to dosage (C/D) ratio gradually increased reaching the maximum on the day after angioplasty. Thereafter, the C/D ratio promptly decreased. Thus, it is speculated that the increase in cyclosporine C/D ratio was mainly dependent on reduction of hepatic clearance of cyclosporin due to hepatic congestion caused by the stenosis of the hepatic venous anastomosis. "
"Abstract: ISTA Pharmaceuticals (formerly Advanced Corneal Systems) has developed an ophthalmic injectable formulation of highly purified hyaluronidase [ovine hyaluronidase, Vitrase] for the initial treatment of vitreous haemorrhage and diabetic retinopathy. Hyaluronidase is a naturally occurring enzyme that digests certain forms of carbohydrate molecules called proteoglycans. The current medical treatment for vitreous haemorrhage is vitrectomy, an invasive surgical procedure that may result in future cataract formation, retinal detachment or other complications. There are currently no approved drug therapies for vitreous haemorrhage. ISTA believes that an injection of Vitrase causes the vitreous to liquefy, thereby promoting the clearance of vision-distorting blood. The elimination of blood helps to restore vision and provides an ophthalmologist with an unobstructed view of the retina, allowing the doctor to diagnose and treat the underlying cause of the hemorrhage. In mid-1997, Advanced Corneal Systems (now ISTA Pharmaceuticals) formed a Singapore subsidiary called Visionex to develop and market the company's technologies in Southeast Asia and China. In March 2000, ISTA completed the acquisition of Visionex. Also in March 2000, subsidiaries of Allergan obtained marketing, sales and distribution agreements from ISTA for Vitrase worldwide, except Mexico (until April 2004) and Japan. ISTA will split Vitrase profits equally with Allergan and receive royalties on sales in non-US countries. ISTA is responsible for all costs of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, of Vitrase and may receive up to 35 million US dollars in milestone payments from Allergan upon the achievement of specified regulatory and development objectives. In December 2001, Otsuka gained exclusive rights to develop, market and commercialise Vitrase in Japan. In July 2002, ISTA announced that it has entered into an agreement with Cardinal Health for the manufacture of commercial quantities of Vitrase. The agreement covers the US, Canada, Japan and the European Union. Cardinal Health will also provide manufacturing-related information for the US New Drug Application (NDA). Sophia Laboratories distribute Vitrase in Mexico. The US FDA designated Vitrase as a fast track product in October 1998, which means the FDA will facilitate the development and expedite the review of the product. Vitrase has being investigated in two multinational, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase III trials in patients with severe vitreous haemorrhage. One was conducted in the US, Mexico and Canada (North American trial) with an enrolment of 750 patients. The second trial was conducted in Europe, Brazil, Australia and South Africa and enrolled 556 patients. In March 2002, ISTA began unmasking the data, revealing that although preliminary efficacy results did not show any statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint, clinically relevant improvements in visual acuity and a decrease in the density of vitreous haemorrhage were observed in patients treated with a 55IU dose of Vitrase, compared with placebo-treated patients. In December 2002, the FDA accepted the NDA for Vitrase for filing. The FDA's Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Advisory Committee reviewed the Vitrase NDA on 17 March 2003 and voted 8 to 4 that there was insufficient statistical evidence to support the use of Vitrasefor the treatment of vitreous haemorrhage. However, the Committee did recognise that in certain patient subgroups, the benefits of Vitrase therapy outweighed the potential risks. The FDA has recommended that ISTA provide additional analyses from the two pivotal phase III trials conducted. In April 2003, the FDA issued an approvable letter for Vitrase for the treatment of vitreous haemorrhage. ISTA anticipates that the FDA will complete its review of the Vitrase NDA anete its review of the Vitrase NDA and issue the results during the second half of 2003. In addition, ISTA plans to submit a marketing approval application with the European Medical Evaluation Agency (EMEA) in the first half of 2003. A phase II trial in Singapore was being conducted by Visionex. However, in March 2000, ISTA completed the acquisition of Visionex. In its Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, as at 31 December 2002, ISTA stated that the continued development of Vitrase for diabetic retinopathy will be dependent upon a number of factors including the FDA's evaluation of Vitrase for the treatment of vitreous hemorrhage, the successful completion of any additional clinical trials for the diabetic retinopathy, and the continuing assessment of the market opportunity for this indication compared with other product opportunities that ISTA may be pursuing at the time. ISTA is also developing hyaluronidase products for the treatment of cataracts (Keratase) and keratoconus (Keraform). "
"Abstract: Cidofovir is a new antiviral drug that has a broad spectrum of activity against several DNA viruses. Many of the disorders caused by these viruses do not have satisfactory therapy, and given the efficacy of this agent in treating many of these conditions, it holds great promise. It is hoped that ongoing studies will confirm the initial anecdotal reports regarding its therapeutic efficacy and lack of systemic side effects. It is also hoped that the cost to formulate and use cidofovir topically will eventually decrease to a level that will allow more widespread use of this drug. "
"OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety and tolerability of a topical gel formulation combining methotrexate and laurocapram and to obtain preliminary information on the therapeutic potential of methotrexate-laurocapram in patients with early-stage mycosis fungoides (stage IA or IB). DESIGN: An open-label, phase 1/2 pilot study. SETTING: Two academic referral centers. PATIENTS: Ten patients 18 years or older with histologically confirmed stage IA or IB mycosis fungoides. Intervention The gel formulation of methotrexate-laurocapram was applied to the total body surface, excluding genital, perianal areas, nipples, face, and skin under the breasts, on an every-other-day basis for 24 consecutive weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The safety of methotrexate-laurocapram was assessed in this study by reviewing adverse events and laboratory data. Efficacy outcomes included changes in lesion condition and severity assessments, reduction in area of sample lesions, and the investigator's global evaluation. RESULTS: Adverse events consisted of skin reactions of mild severity. No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were observed. Based on the investigator's global evaluation at the end of the treatment phase (week 24), 7 (78%) of 9 patients demonstrated a slight-to-moderate response to treatment with methotrexate-laurocapram. Statistical significance (P =.049) was reached for induration and pruritus, a trend (P =.10) was observed for erythema, and no change was found for scaling (P =.37). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the topical administration of methotrexate-laurocapram is safe and in general well tolerated. This treatment may represent a new therapeutic potential for patients with mycosis fungoides. "
"Abstract: At the Albany Medical Center, we have a long-term experience, mean follow-up of 61 months, in 31 renal transplant recipients treated with sirolimus, cyclosporine microemulsion formulation, and prednisone. In these patients the rate of acute rejection was 13%, actual patient and graft survival at 1 year was 100%, and the mean serum creatinine at 1 year was 1.3 mg/dL. Furthermore, long-term graft survival was 90%. The success of this regimen stimulated us to evaluate a subsequent sirolimus-based protocol, initiated in April, 2001, which decreased exposure to calcincurin inhibitors at 3 months posttransplant (n = 50). At a mean follow-up of 10 months, graft survival was 96%. The rate of acute rejection was only 10% and the mean serum creatinine was 1.5 mg/dL. Furthermore, no acute rejection episodes have developed subsequent to the reduction in calcineurin inhibitor dosing at 3 months. Sirolimus is an effective immunosuppressive agent that safely allows for a reduction in calcineurin-inhibitor dosing. "
"BACKGROUND: Tazarotene in a gel formulation is widely used in the treatment of psoriasis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of tazarotene 0.1% and 0.05% creams in the treatment of psoriasis. METHODS: A total of 1303 patients participated in 2 clinical trials. Patients applied tazarotene creams 0.1% and 0.05% or vehicle once daily to all psoriatic lesions for 12 weeks followed by a 12-week posttreatment period. RESULTS: Both creams were significantly more effective than vehicle on the basis of an overall assessment of psoriasis, a global response to treatment, and reduction in plaque elevation and scaling. Therapeutic effect was maintained during the posttreatment period. Common adverse events included signs and symptoms of skin irritation. CONCLUSION: Tazarotene creams were associated with significant reductions in the severity of the clinical signs of psoriasis and were found to be safe with acceptable tolerability. Tazarotene cream 0.1% was generally more effective, although slightly less well tolerated, than the 0.05% cream. "
"BACKGROUND: The aim of the present trial was to evaluate the efficacy of a combined product in the treatment of common cold and to examine the contribution of the separate components. In the published literature there is conflicting data on the efficacy of agents used in the treatment of common cold, especially when given in drug combinations. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, 4-arm, controlled trial was carried out in 1,167 patients with common cold treated with one of the following medications: Grippostad-C, a combination of acetaminophen, caffeine, chlorpheniramine and ascorbic acid (verum), ascorbic acid (control), chlorpheniramine and ascorbic acid (reference 1), as well as acetaminophen, caffeine, and ascorbic acid (reference 2). A score of common cold symptoms (headache, throat pain, extremities and joint pain, cough, blocked nose, and disturbances of sleep quality) was the primary outcome. The test drug was first compared with the control using a hierarchic test strategy, then with reference 1, followed by reference 2 with the aim of proving superiority. FINDINGS: A clinically relevant and statistically significant difference was demonstrated at each level of the hierarchy. Grippostad-C was significantly superior to all other treatment groups, the combination of acetaminophen, caffeine, and ascorbic acid was significantly superior to the control, and the combination of chlorpheniramine and ascorbic acid was not statistically different from the control. INTERPRETATION: The efficacy of Grippostad-C for the treatment of common cold was proven. The findings demonstrate that the combination is superior to each of its separate components and each of the components has its own distinctive contribution to the efficacy of the combination product.

"Abstract: Mild to moderate psoriasis is a disease that can often be treated with topical medications. The diversity of topical therapies and their disparate side effects complicates treatment planning. Our purpose is to compare the rates of adverse events associated with different topical psoriasis treatments. A review of medical literature from 1996 to March, 2002 was conducted using guidelines set by QUORUM statement criteria. In monotherapy studies, corticosteriods caused fewer adverse reactions compared to vitamin D analogues and tazarotene. In combination studies adverse event rates were higher than in monotherapy studies, except for the combination of topical steroid and calcipotriene which decreased irritation. Irritant contact dermatitis was the main side effect with vitamin D analogues, tazarotene, dithranol or coal tar, while side effects of topical corticosteriods included headache, viral infection and skin atrophy. Topical agents for psoriasis are usually well-tolerated without severe side effects. Formulating a patient's medication regimen should take into account the needs for short-term management and long-term control of psoriasis. Since clearance is not a realistic expectation, reasonable goals should be set as excessive use of topical treatments may increase the risk of both cutaneous and systemic side effects. "
"Abstract: According to the patients, improvement of efficacy, long-term safety and improvement of compliance are needed. The topical treatment has been innovated during the last decade. Most important are the introduction of two new classes of treatments: topical vitamin D(3) analogues and the retinoid tazarotene. To what extent, however, have we achieved developments which are in line with the needs as expressed by the patients? Improved efficacy has been realized by successful combinations of topical treatments. In particular, the combinations of dithranol, vitamin D(3) and tazarotene with a topical corticosteroid proved to be very effective with a reduced profile of side-effects. The efficacy of vitamin D(3) analogues and tazarotene is such that the efficacy of a potent corticosteroid (betamethasone-17-valerate) is approached; calcipotriol even showed an efficacy which is at least as good as this corticosteroid. The long-term safety of new compounds has been evaluated for at least 12 months in large studies. Remarkably for corticosteroids such information is available for only 12 weeks. However, intermittent applications of a topical corticosteroid in combination with another topical treatment provide an effective and safe long-term control of psoriasis. Compliance is a conditio sine qua non for an effective topical treatment. Important progress has been made to increase compliance. Short-contact dithranol has been popularized as an ambulatory treatment which is a highly effective approach as a care instruction programme. Formulations which are better from a cosmetical point of view have been developed for various topical treatments. Reduction of the frequency of applications proved to be possible for most treatments. Once daily applications for corticosteroids, vitamin D(3) analogues and retinoids have been developed, and intermittent applications, a few times per week, are possible for corticosteroids, which proved to be very effective with a reduced profile of side-effects, and are also developed for dithranol.

"Abstract: Tazarotene is a receptor-selective retinoid, which is efficacious in the treatment of patients with psoriasis, acne vulgaris, and photoaging. It normalizes keratinocyte differentiation, reverses keratinocyte hyperproliferation, and has anti-inflammatory effects. Clinical studies have shown that tazarotene 0.1% gel has greater comedolytic activity than tretinoin (Retin-A 0.025% gel, Retin-A Micro 0.1%) and adapalene (Differin) 0.1% gel. Although it is efficacious as monotherapy, tazarotene is more commonly used as part of combination therapy with a topical antibacterial in patients with acne vulgaris, and with a mid- or high-potency topical corticosteroid or with phototherapy in patients with psoriasis. Combination therapy enhances efficacy and tolerability. Tazarotene 0.1% gel, used in combination with mometasone furoate 0.1% cream, was shown in psoriasis clinical trials to be more efficacious than calcipotriene (calcipotriol) ointment used twice daily, or mometasone furoate 0.1% cream used twice daily. Use of tazarotene in conjunction with broad band UVB, narrow band UVB or bath psoralens + UVA (PUVA) results in greater efficacy than with phototherapy alone. Tazarotene should not be administered during pregnancy or in women who are not practicing adequate contraception. Adverse events consist primarily of irritation, peeling, erythema, dryness, burning, and itching. They are most common during the first 1-2 weeks of therapy and can be minimized with use of the cream formulation, alternate day application, short contact therapy, mild cleansers, and combination therapy.

"OBJECTIVE: The safety and efficacy of a 1% cream formulation of pimecrolimus, a selective, nonsteroid immunomodulator, was studied in infants with atopic dermatitis (AD). METHODS: During a 6-week double-blind phase, 186 infants with mild/moderate AD were randomly assigned to twice-daily pimecrolimus cream 1% or vehicle. All patients were subsequently treated with open-label pimecrolimus for 20 weeks. RESULTS: At the end of the double-blind phase, 54.5% and 23.8% of patients in the pimecrolimus and vehicle groups, respectively, were clear or almost clear of AD (P <.001). Similar improvements were observed in the Eczema Area and Severity Index, pruritus assessment, and the care giver's assessment. By the first return visit, 69.9% and 36.5% of pimecrolimus and vehicle-treated patients, respectively, achieved absent or mild pruritus. Efficacy during the double-blind phase was maintained throughout the open-label phase. Vehicle-treated patients transferring to open-label pimecrolimus rapidly achieved disease control comparable to those receiving continuous pimecrolimus. There were no significant differences between groups in application site reactions or skin infections. Most adverse events were mild or moderate and unrelated to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Pimecrolimus was safe in infants with AD, with rapid and sustained efficacy. Pimecrolimus holds promise as a valuable new treatment option for the youngest patients with AD. "
"Abstract: Systemic treatment is required in patients with moderate-to-severe acne, especially when acne scars start to occur. Antibiotics with anti-inflammatory properties, such as tetracyclines (oxytetracycline, tetracycline chloride, doxycycline, minocycline and limecycline) and macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin and azithromycin) are the agents of choice for papulopustular acne, even though the emerging resistant bacterial strains are minimizing their effect, especially regarding erythromycin. Systemic antibiotics should be administered during a period of 8-12 weeks. In severe papulopustular and in nodulocystic/conglobate acne, oral isotretinoin is the treatment of choice. Hormonal treatment represents an alternative regimen in female acne, whereas it is mandatory in resistant, severe pubertal or post-adolescent forms of the disease. Compounds with anti-androgenic properties include estrogens combined with progestins, such as ethinyl estradiol with cyproterone acetate, chlormadinone acetate, desogestrel, drospirenone, levonogestrel, norethindrone acetate, norgestimate, and other anti-androgens directly blocking the androgen receptor (flutamide) or inhibiting androgen activity at various levels, corticosteroids, spironolactone, cimetidine, and ketoconazole. After 3 months of treatment control of seborrhea and acne can be obtained. Low-dose corticosteroids (prednisone, prednisolone, or dexamethasone) are indicated in patients with adrenal hyperandrogenism or acne fulminans. New developments and future trends represent low-dose long-term isotretinoin regimens, new isotretinoin formulations (micronized isotretinoin), isotretinoin metabolites, combination treatments to reduce toxicity, insulin-sensitizing agents, 5alpha-reductase type 1 inhibitors, antisense oligonucleotide molecules, and, especially, new anti-inflammatory agents, such as lipoxygenase inhibitors.

"OBJECTIVE: This in vitro study characterized the hemolysis and cytotoxicity of ZUT, an experimental glass ionomer cement (GIC) sealer with an added antimicrobial-containing zeolite (0.2% Zeomic w/w). STUDY DESIGN: ZUT, Ketac-Cem (GIC component of ZUT), Ketac-Endo, and two AH 26 sealer formulations were tested at various times after mixing. Hemolysis produced by standardized specimens was determined spectrophotometrically (n = 6/material). Cytotoxicity was assessed by using a Millipore Filter test with a HeLa cell monolayer (n = 10/material). Tests were repeated, and results were analyzed with a one-way analysis of variance (alpha = .05). RESULTS: Disks of AH 26 containing silver produced the most hemolysis of all test groups (P < .0001). Compared to controls, GICs and AH 26 formulations were noncytotoxic at 1 and 6 hours after mixing, respectively (P > .05). Addition of Zeomic did not increase the cytotoxic and hemolytic activity of Ketac-Cem (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Overall results suggest ZUT is less cytotoxic than AH 26 and possesses characteristics similar to the other GIC formulations tested. "
"Abstract: Ultraviolet radiation (280-400 nm)-induced suppression of cutaneous cell-mediated immunity plays an important part in the development of skin cancer. Sunscreens are widely advocated to protect against skin cancer but if they offer insufficient protection against immunosuppression they may inadvertently increase skin cancer risk. This human study evaluated immunoprotection afforded by a commercial sunscreen preparation (labeled sun protection factor 15) offering primarily ultraviolet B (280-320 nm) protection. Indirectly, it also investigated whether ultraviolet A (320-400 nm) plays a part in ultraviolet radiation-induced immunosuppression. Healthy white-skinned volunteers were used (n=119). Ultraviolet radiation exposures were on previously unexposed buttock skin with an ultraviolet radiation source that complied with European recommendations for sunscreen testing. Ultraviolet radiation dose-response curves for sunburn/erythema and suppression of the contact hypersensitivity response were generated either with or without sunscreen in vivo and protection factors were derived for both end-points. The ultraviolet radiation wavelengths transmitted by the sunscreen were determined in vitro and showed that the sunscreen was primarily an ultraviolet B absorber, with relatively poor absorption in the ultraviolet A region. The sun-screen protected against both erythema and immunosuppression but protection against immunosuppression (IPF=4.9, 95% confidence interval: 2.3-10.6) was less than half that for erythema (Ery-PFg=14.2, 95% confidence interval: 10.2-19.8). Failure of the sunscreen to afford comparable protection against both end-points was probably due to immunosuppression by ultraviolet A, a part of the solar spectrum that does not readily cause sunburn. The sunscreen protected against both end-points, which supports the use of sunscreens to reduce immunosuppression but protection against immunosuppression may be improved if sunscreens are formulated to offer equivalent protection against ultraviolet B and ultraviolet A.

"BACKGROUND: Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease of unknown origin characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomas, in particular in the lungs, lymph nodes, eyes, and skin. Systemic treatment for cutaneous sarcoidosis can be used for large disfiguring lesions, generalized involvement, or recalcitrant lesions that did not respond to topical therapy. CASE PRESENTATIONS: We report three patients with recalcitrant cutaneous sarcoidosis who were treated with oral fumaric acid esters (FAE). Three female patients presented with cutaneous sarcoidosis that have proved to be refractory to various therapies, including corticosteroids and chloroquine. We treated the patients with FAE in tablet form using two formulations differing in strength (Fumaderm initial, Fumaderm). Dosage of FAE was performed according to the standard therapy regimen for psoriasis patients. After treatment with FAE (4-12 months), a complete clearance of skin lesions was achieved in the three patients. The side effects observed in this trial correspond to the well-known spectrum of adverse effects of FAE (flush, minor gastrointestinal complaints, lymphopenia). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of our findings FAE therapy seems to be a safe and effective regimen for patients with recalcitrant cutaneous sarcoidosis. Nevertheless further investigations are necessary to confirm our preliminary results. "
"Abstract: Ketoconazole (KET) and zinc pyrithione (ZPT) are compounds active against the Malassezia spp. yeasts, which are believed to play a major role in dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. We compared the efficacy and safety of KET 2% and ZPT 1% in shampoo formulations for the alleviation of severe dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. This open randomized, parallel-group trial began with a 2-week run-in phase during which subjects applied a neutral non-antidandruff shampoo. It was followed by a 4-week randomized treatment phase and a subsequent 4-week follow-up phase without treatment. Shampooing during the treatment period was carried out twice weekly for the KET group and at least twice weekly for the ZPT group in accordance with the label instructions. A total of 343 subjects were recruited to enter the trial. Of the 331 eligible volunteers, 171 were randomized to KET 2% and 160 to ZPT 1%. Clinical assessments were performed. Beneficial effects were evidenced for both medicated shampoos, but the effect was significantly better for KET 2%, which achieved a 73% improvement in the total dandruff severity score compared with 67% for ZPT 1% at week 4 (p < 0.02). The recurrence rate of the disease was also significantly lower following KET 2% treatment than following ZPT 1% treatment. As a consequence, the overall clearing of the skin condition at the end of treatment and follow-up phase was in favor of the KET 2% formulation (p = 0.004). Side effects were minimal. It is concluded that after a 4-week treatment, KET 2% shampoo was significantly superior to ZPT 1% shampoo in the treatment of subjects with severe dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp. It is our assumption that this difference is noticeable for the patient and as a consequence relevant. Both formulations were well tolerated. "
"Abstract: Reconstructed skin and epidermis models are finding increasingly numerous applications in cosmetology and dermatology. In particular, they are currently employed to assess the tolerability and efficacy of raw materials and formulations, in conditions approaching those of normal use. Importantly, the use of such models greatly reduces the need for animal testing. Various models of reconstructed skin and epidermis have been developed [1-4] and some are now produced industrially [5-8]. They are used for the prediction of cutaneous irritancy and, to a lesser extent, percutaneous absorption and cutaneous metabolism. However, before being officially recognized as valid alternative methods and entering routine use, standard protocols must be developed to assess their reproducibility and performance as compared with in situ human studies. "
"BACKGROUND: A variety of topical anesthetic compounds are available for use prior to minimally or moderately painful cutaneous laser procedures. A novel lidocaine/tetracaine-based peel has recently been developed that is applied to the skin as a cream and, once air dried, is removed as a flexible film that may prove useful in providing adequate dermal anesthesia for dermatologic laser surgery. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of a novel topical anesthetic peel preparation for induction of local anesthesia prior to full-face cutaneous laser resurfacing. METHODS: A series of 20 patients undergoing full-face single-pass CO2 laser resurfacing were enrolled in a double-blind institutional review board (IRB)-approved study protocol in which two different topical anesthetic products were compared. A 4 cm x 4 cm area of one cheek was randomized to receive the novel lidocaine/tetracaine-based cream peel (S-Caine) while a 4 cm x 4 cm area on the contralateral side received EMLA cream with occlusion for 30 minutes prior to laser treatment. Patients rated the level of pain experienced during laser treatment on each side using a visual analog scale. Independent assessments of observed discomfort and side effects were recorded RESULTS: Pain scores were significantly lower using the novel lidocaine/tetracaine-based cream peel formulation compared with the EMLA cream. Side effects associated with application of the anesthetic peel were limited to mild transient erythema and skin blanching. CONCLUSION: A novel topical lidocaine/tetracaine-based cream peel provides safe and effective dermal anesthesia for single-pass CO2 laser skin resurfacing. "
"BACKGROUND: The S-Caine peel (Zars, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) is a novel eutectic lidocaine/tetracaine mixture that is applied as a cream, drying upon exposure to air to form a flexible film that can be peeled off easily. The patented formulation can be used to anesthetize the skin prior to a variety of cutaneous procedures. OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical efficacy of the S-Caine peel as a topical anesthetic for pulsed dye laser (PDL) treatment and to determine the optimal application time for adequate cutaneous anesthesia. METHODS: Sixty patients were enrolled in one of three separate double-blind, placebo-controlled protocols in which the active product or a placebo was applied to the skin and left intact for 20, 30, or 60 minutes prior to laser treatment. A 585 nm or 595 nm PDL was used to treat facial telangiectases or port-wine stains in each protocol. Patients rated the level of pain experienced during laser treatment on a visual analog scale (VAS). Independent assessments of observed discomfort and side effects were recorded. RESULTS: All patients experienced significant pain reduction with the S-Caine peel as their sole topical anesthetic. An application time of 20 or 30 minutes was as effective as 60 minutes in achieving anesthesia. Side effects of the peel application were limited to transient mild erythema. CONCLUSION: The S-Caine peel is a rapid, safe, and effective method of topical anesthesia for cutaneous PDL treatment. "
"Abstract: Malignancies in childhood occur with an incidence of 13-14 per 100,000 children under the age of 15 years. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with an incidence of 29% is the most common paediatric malignancy, whereas acute myeloid leukaemias account for about 5%. The treatment of acute leukaemias consists of sequential therapy cycles (induction, consolidation, intensification, maintenance therapy) with different cytostatic drugs over a time period of up to 1.5-3 years. Over the last 25 years of clinical trials, a significant rise in the rate of complete remissions as well as an increase in long-term survival has been achieved. Therefore, growing attention is now focused on the long-term effects of antileukaemic treatment. Several cytostatic drugs administered in the treatment of acute leukaemia in childhood are known to cause long-term adverse effects. Anthracyclines may induce chronic cardiotoxicity, alkylating agents are likely to cause gonadal damage and secondary malignancies and the use of glucocorticoids may cause osteonecrosis. Most of the long-term adverse effects have not been analysed systematically. Approaches to minimising long-term adverse effects without jeopardising outcome have included: the design of new drugs such as a liposomal formulation of anthracyclines, the development of anthracycline-derivates with lower toxicity, the development of cardioprotective agents or, more recently, the use of targeted therapy;alternative administration schedules like continuous infusion or timed sequential therapy; and risk group stratification by the monitoring of minimal residual disease. Several attempts have been made to minimise the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines: decreasing concentrations delivered to the myocardium by either prolonging infusion time or using liposomal formulated anthracyclines or less cardiotoxic analogues, or the additional administration of cardioprotective agents. The advantage of these approaches is still controversial, but there are ongoing clinical trials to evaluate the long-term effects. The use of new diagnostic methods, such as diagnosis of minimal residual disease, which allow reduction or optimisation of dose, offer potential advantages compared with conventional treatment in terms of reducing the risk of severe long-term adverse effects. Most options for minimising long-term adverse effects have resulted from theoretical models and in vitro studies, but only some of the modalities such as the use of dexrazoxane, the continuous infusion of anthracyclines or timed sequential therapy, have been evaluated in prospective, randomised studies in patients. Future approaches to predict severe toxicity may be based upon pharmacogenetics and gene profiling. "
"Abstract: A simple in vitro approach where sun formulations are spread on a quartz slide and placed over human skin cells in culture is proposed as a convenient test for photoprotection assessment at the DNA level. Using the comet assay, DNA strand breaks and oxidative DNA damage were detected. Then, accumulation of p53 protein was studied as a marker for UV-induced genotoxic stress. Such a method was used to compare formulations with different photostability. Spectroradiometry showed that a photo-unstable formulation lost its effectiveness in UVA screening when pre-irradiated by simulated sunlight. As a consequence, such a formulation was not as protective as a photostable one at the genomic level. "
"Abstract: Conventional treatment of atopic dermatitis includes the regular, frequent use of emollients, and intermittent application of topical corticosteroids to control acute 'flares'. [symbol: see text] Tacrolimus (pronounced ta-kro-li-mus), which is available for systemic use for the prevention of organ rejection following allogenic liver and kidney transplantation, is now formulated as an immunosuppressant ointment (Protopic-Fujisawa). This is licensed for use in adults and children aged 2 years and over with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis inadequately responsive to conventional therapy. Promotion states that, in these groups, tacrolimus is ""at least as effective as topical steroids"" and ""without the potential side effects of conventional therapy"". Here we consider the place of tacrolimus ointment in the management of atopic dermatitis. "
"Abstract: Ketotifen fumarate, formulated for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis, is a histamine H1-receptor antagonist, mast cell stabilizer, and eosinophil inhibitor (decreases chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils). In this study, healthy volunteers 3 years of age or older received ketotifen fumarate .025% ophthalmic solution (n = 330) or placebo (n = 165) four times daily for 6 weeks. Ketotifen was safe and well tolerated in the adult and pediatric populations, with an incidence of ocular adverse events of 18.2%, compared with 15.2% with placebo. No ocular rebound vasodilation or itching was observed within 48 hours after treatment. Ketotifen has a favorable safety and tolerability profile, which may have a positive impact on compliance, an important aspect of effective symptomatic control of allergic conjunctivitis. "
"BACKGROUND: This study was designed to investigate the overall usefulness of rectal thiopental, rectal midazolam and i.m. modified cocktail (meperidine-chlorpromazine hydrochloride-feniramin maleat) in 70 children undergoing computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: The dosage of thiopental was 50 mg per kg for infants under 6 months of age, 35 mg per kg between six and 12 months, and 25 mg per kg for older children. The maximal dose did not exceed 700 mg in this study. The dosage of midazolam was 1 mg per kg for all children. A modified cocktail was described as a formulation including 11 mg/mL of meperidine, 2.8 mg/mL of chlorpromazine and 2.8 mg/mL of pheniramine maleat. The dosage of modified cocktail was 0.1 mL per kg for all children. RESULTS: The mean induction time for the i.m. cocktail was significantly longer than that for rectal thiopental (P < 0.001). The mean duration of deep sedation was 60.79 +/- 27.00 min with rectal thiopental and 58.74 +/- 39.70 min with i.m. cocktail (P > 0.05). Although the mean duration of sleep for rectal thiopental and i.m. cocktail was similar, the mean discharge duration for i.m. cocktail was significantly longer than that for rectal thiopental (P < 0.05). Children sedated with the cocktail therapy also required a longer period of observation in the department. Significant decreases in heart rate, systolic blood pressure and oxygen saturation occurred in three groups (P < 0.001). Significant decreases in body temperature occurred after rectal thiopental and i.m. cocktail therapy (P < 0.01). The effect of rectal midazolam was minimal. CONCLUSIONS: Rectal thiopental may be the drug of choice for pediatric sedation because it has a more rapid onset and offset of action. It is also safe and effective at the dosage studied in children undergoing MRI. Rectal midazolam also may be used in children undergoing CT imaging because of minimal side-effects. "
"Abstract: The effects of beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) on the base-catalyzed degradation and light-induced decomposition of the sunscreen agent, trans-2-ethylhexyl-p-methoxycinnamate (trans-EHMC) were investigated. Reversed-phase liquid chromatography was used to study the interaction between natural and modified cyclodextrins, added to the mobile phase, and the sunscreen. Among the available cyclodextrins (beta-CD, HP-beta-CD, hydroxypropyl-alpha-cyclodextrin and hydroxypropyl-gamma-cyclodextrin), only HP-beta-CD and beta-CD produced a significant decrease in the chromatographic retention of trans-EHMC. The complexation of the sunscreen agent with HP-beta-CD and beta-CD was confirmed by thermal analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. beta-CD depressed the decomposition of trans-EHMC in alkaline solutions more effectively than HP-beta-CD. Moreover, the irradiation-induced degradation of the sunscreen agent in emulsion vehicles was reduced by complexation with beta-CD (the extent of degradation was 26.1% for the complex compared to 35.8% for free trans-EHMC) whereas HP-beta-CD had no significant effect. Therefore, the complex of beta-CD with trans-EHMC enhances the chemical- and photo-stability of the sunscreen agent. Moreover, it limits adverse interactions of the UV filter with other formulation ingredients. "
"BACKGROUND: Gengraf capsule, an AB-rated generic cyclosporine for Neoral, has been shown to be bioequivalent in previous studies. The purpose of this pharmacokinetic study performed in stable renal transplant recipients was to evaluate interchangeability of Gengraf and Neoral. METHODS: Using an open-label, three-period design, 50 renal transplant recipients taking stable doses of Neoral completed a multicenter study. Subjects continued their Neoral regimen during period I (days 1-14). Subjects then switched from Neoral on a milligram-for-milligram basis to Gengraf during period II (days 15-28), followed by conversion to the same milligram-for-milligram dosing regimen of Neoral during period III (days 29-35). Twelve-hour pharmacokinetic evaluations (maximum observed blood concentration [C(max) ], concentration before dosing [C(trough) ], time to maximum observed concentration [T(max) ], and area under the blood concentration-vs.-time curve [AUC]) occurred on days 1, 14, 15, 28, and 29. Additional predose samples (C (trough)) were evaluated on days 7, 21, and 35. Laboratory and safety parameters were also evaluated. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of Gengraf (C(max), T(max), C(trough), and AUC) were indistinguishable from the Neoral values in stable renal allograft recipients. The bioequivalent capsules were interchangeable with respect to C(max), C(trough), and AUC at steady state and also on conversion from one capsule formulation to the other. The 90% confidence intervals (CI) for the Gengraf versus Neoral comparison at steady state (day 28 vs. day 14) were 0.95 to 1.03 for AUC and 0.92 to 1.04 for C(max). Trough concentrations remained consistent throughout the study, with no need for dosage adjustment in any of the subjects. Gengraf is well tolerated, with an excellent safety profile, comparable to the safety profile of Neoral. CONCLUSIONS The pharmacokinetics of Gengraf are equivalent and indistinguishable from those of Neoral. Gengraf is well tolerated and interchangeable with Neoral in stable renal transplant recipients.

"Abstract: The present study demonstrates the equivalent efficacy for BDP 500 microg bid given via MDI with the new HFA-134a propellant (Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A., Parma) compared to a conventional CFC propellant (Becotide, Allen & Hanburys, UK). One hundred and sixteen adult patients with stable mild to moderate asthma (FEV1 > or = 60% of predicted normal) entered a 2-week run-in period where they maintained their own inhaled corticosteroids and were then assigned to a 12-week treatment with the test drug in a randomized, multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group design. Ninety-one patients completed the study period. Morning and evening peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), use of rescue salbutamol, number of daytime and nighttime asthma attacks, number of nighttime awakenings, and clinical symptoms were recorded daily by patients on a diary card. Pulmonary function tests (FEV1, FVC, PEFR, MEF50 and FEF25) were completed at study entry, at the start of treatment and every 2 weeks thereafter. Morning (08.00-10.00 AM) serum cortisol was measured at the start and at the end of treatment. Adverse events were collected for the total study period. Equivalence between groups was demonstrated for the primary end-point morning PEFR, as well as for evening PEFR and FEV1 (the 95% CI of the treatments' difference was within the 5% of the LSM of BDP CFC). The other secondary pulmonary function tests measured at the clinic visit showed a satisfactory asthma control, albeit without statistically significant differences between groups. Decreases in the use of rescue salbutamol and in clinical symptoms were also reported in both groups, with no differences between them. Adverse events were reported in 81.4% of patients in the BDP HFA group and in 82.5% in the CFC group. There were 73 and 59 adverse drug reactions in the two groups, respectively; the difference was mainly due to differences in taste. No drug-related serious adverse events were reported in either group. No difference was seen for morning serum cortisol between baseline and end of treatment, or between groups. In conclusion, the BDP-HFA 134a formulation proved to be statistically equivalent to the standard BDP CFC product over 12 weeks in adult patients with mild to moderate asthma. "
"Abstract: Actinic keratosis (AK) is a lesion induced by UV radiation, affecting predominantly fair-skinned individuals with a history of excessive sun exposure. Because AKs are potentially cancerous, management of AKs is important for dermatologists. The most frequently performed procedure for AKs is excision or destruction of the lesion, followed by biopsy. Topical fluorouracil creams are an efficient, effective treatment, especially for large quantities of widespread lesions. However, fluorouracil can produce an inflammatory facial reaction that is associated with the destruction of AKs. A new formulation, 0.5% fluorouracil cream, is indicated for once-daily use with a duration of treatment of up to 4 weeks. This regimen may be more cost-effective than the higher concentrations of fluorouracil creams (5% and 1%, respectively), which specify twice-daily application. Less frequent applications also may improve patient compliance with topical fluorouracil treatment. The use of 0.5% fluorouracil cream may provide an effective, safe, and economical option to augment the available treatments of AK, which include liquid nitrogen cryotherapy and 5% and 1% fluorouracil creams.

"BACKGROUND: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), compared to azathioprine (AZA), reduces acute rejection and treatment failure in cyclosporine (CsA) and steroid regimens, but its effect on graft survival is unproven from prospective studies and prolonged use is costly. This study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of replacing MMF by AZA after 3 months. METHODS: This 28 center, prospective, 12-month, parallel group, open-label study, randomized patients to three groups with microemulsion formulation of CsA (ME-CsA) and steroids as baseline therapy. Group 1 (n=158) received MMF for 3 months, replaced by AZA for 9 months; group 2 (n=162) received MMF for 12 months; and group 3 (n=157) received AZA for 12 months. RESULTS: Treatment failure and the cumulative rate of acute rejection were significantly lower in the MMF groups compared with the AZA group (P=0.007 and P=0.03, respectively). Graft loss, death, and safety profiles of all three treatments were similar over 12 months, as were mean serum creatinine levels. Switching from MMF to AZA did not affect treatment failure. No patient in group 1 experienced a recurrent rejection after month 3, one patient died, and nine patients experienced first rejection episodes. Most rejections (6/9) were steroid-sensitive and histologically mild. CONCLUSIONS: Replacement of MMF by AZA after 3 months of therapy with ME-CsA and steroids provides comparable efficacy and safety profiles to continuous MMF over 12 months. Although apparently a cost-effective option, long-term studies are required to assess the benefit/risk ratio of this therapy switch in different patient subpopulations. "
"BACKGROUND: With the transition to hydrofluoroalkane-134a propellants in metered dose inhalers, it is important to consider the efficacy and safety profiles of formulations containing inhaled corticosteroids. We examined the airway and systemic effects of hydrofluoroalkane-134a fluticasone propionate (FLU-HFA) and beclomethasone dipropionate (BEC-HFA) at recommended labelled doses. METHODS: Twenty mild to moderate asthmatics were randomised in crossover fashion to receive 6 weeks of 500 micro g/day followed by 1000 micro g/day FLU-HFA and BEC-HFA. Measurements were made at baseline after placebo run in and washout, and after each randomised treatment. The primary airway outcome for benefit was the dose of methacholine provoking a fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) of 20% or more (methacholine PD(20)) and for systemic adverse effects was overnight urinary cortisol/creatinine (OUCC). RESULTS: For mean responses, both doses of BEC-HFA and FLU-HFA produced significant improvements in PD(20) compared with baseline. The improvement was not significantly greater with 1000 micro g/day FLU-HFA versus BEC-HFA, a 1.69 fold difference (95% CI 0.94 to 3.04). Both doses of BEC-HFA but not FLU-HFA caused significant suppression of OUCC compared with baseline, with significantly (p<0.05) lower values at 1000 micro g/day for BEC-HFA versus FLU-HFA (1.97 fold difference (95% CI 1.28 to 3.02)). CONCLUSION: There was no difference in the airway and systemic effects in patients with mild to moderate asthma between FLU-HFA and BEC-HFA at a dose of 500 micro g/day. At 1000 micro g/day there was increased systemic bioactivity with BEC-HFA compared with FLU-HFA, without any gain in airway efficacy. "
"BACKGROUND: Topical retinoids are highly effective treatments for acne vulgaris. The various formulations and concentrations available allow physicians to tailor therapies to individual patient's needs and minimize the cutaneous irritation that is often observed with the use of these drugs. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of tretinoin gel microsphere 0.1% with adapalene gel 0.1% in the treatment of acne vulgaris. METHODS: A 12-week double-blind study was conducted, and patients were evaluated at baseline and at weeks 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. RESULTS: Although the two drugs displayed similar efficacy in the resolution of acne lesions at 12 weeks, a significantly greater reduction in the number of comedones was seen at week 4 among patients treated with tretinoin gel microsphere (p = 0.047). Patients receiving tretinoin gel microsphere had an increased incidence of dryness (weeks 8 and 10) and peeling (weeks 3, 6, 8, and 10) compared with those patients treated with adapalene gel, but the two groups were comparable with respect to erythema, burning/stinging, and itching. CONCLUSION: Both drugs have similar efficacy in the resolution of acne lesions but tretinoin gel microsphere may result in a faster onset of action in the reduction of comedones compared to adapalene.

"Abstract: We have prepared a novel, aqueous gel-based, liposome-entrapped formulation of dithranol. Herein, we report preliminary observations on its efficacy, tolerability, and cosmetic acceptability in treating stable plaque psoriasis. Nineteen plaques of psoriasis in nine adult patients were treated for six weeks in a prospective, open-label trial. In five patients, there was total clearance of lesions, with more than 50% subsidence in a further two patients. Significantly, there were no reports of lesional or perilesional irritation, and only one patient showed faint brown staining of the skin, which was completely and rapidly reversible. These preliminary results indicate that our liposomal dithranol gel has potential advantages over presently available preparations of dithranol; these may translate into enhanced acceptance of this useful drug by patients and physicians.

"STUDY OBJECTIVE: s: To compare the effect of 4 weeks of treatment with fluticasone propionate (FP), 100 micro g bid, delivered either via the Diskhaler (GlaxoSmithKline; Middlesex, UK) or a hydrofluoroalkane (HFA)-134a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) on airway responsiveness. DESIGN: A single-center, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled crossover study. SETTING: Outpatients. PATIENTS: Patients with mild asthma who had not received corticosteroids for 4 weeks prior to the study. INTERVENTIONS: FP, 100 micro g bid, via the Diskhaler, HFA-134a pMDI, or placebo for periods of 4 weeks. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The primary efficacy variable was the provocative dose of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV(1) (PD(20)) at the end of each 4-week treatment period. The FP formulations were defined as equivalent if the treatment difference was within +/- 1 doubling dose of methacholine. Forty-seven patients were included in the per-protocol population. The baseline PD(20) geometric mean was 0.21 mg, which increased to 0.55 mg with FP via the HFA-134a pMDI and to 0.68 mg with FP via the Diskhaler. The treatment difference between adjusted means was - 0.16 doubling doses (95% confidence interval, - 0.62 to 0.31 doubling doses; p = 0.503). Both significantly decreased airway responsiveness compared to placebo (p < 0.001), and also significantly increased lung function with no difference between the two active groups. FP was well tolerated with few adverse events and no effect on serum cortisol levels. CONCLUSIONS: FP delivered via the HFA-134a pMDI is equivalent to FP via the Diskhaler in reducing airway responsiveness. "
"Abstract: The efficacy of a molybdate formulation and a zinc oxide bolus as prophylactic agents for enzootic icterus was evaluated in sheep. Before copper loading, liver biopsies were performed on 12 male, 6-month-old, Mutton Merino sheep to determine hepatic copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) concentrations. The animals were restrictively randomised according to liver copper concentrations to 3 treatment groups (n = 4) to achieve similar mean liver copper concentrations per group. All sheep received 4 ml/kg of a 0.5 % aqueous solution of CuSO4 5H2O intraruminally 7 days per week for 10 weeks. On Day 0 the sheep in the Mo-group were injected subcutaneously with 42 mg molybdenum (Mo) contained in a commercial molybdate formulation. The animals in the Zn-group each received a zinc oxide bolus, containing 43 g zinc oxide, via a rumen cannula. Treatment was repeated on Day 42. Four animals served as untreated controls. Urinary copper excretion, plasma copper concentration, haematocrit and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) activity were determined throughout the trial. The animals were sacrificed after 10 weeks and liver samples were submitted for histopathological examination. Liver and kidney copper and zinc concentrations were determined. Neither the molybdate treatment nor the zinc oxide boluses prevented hepatic copper accumulation. The urinary copper excretion, plasma copper concentration, haematocrit and GLDH activity were not significantly different (P > 0.05) from the controls. "
"Abstract: The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a range of passive and reactive barrier cream formulations against the chemical warfare agent sulphur mustard (SM) using an in vitro diffusion cell system containing human skin. In general, proprietary formulations were relatively effective under occluded conditions, but ineffective under unoccluded conditions. For example, SM skin absorption rates through occluded control and Stokoderm pre-treated skin were 538 +/- 193 and 200 +/- 51 microg x cm(-2) x h(-1), respectively (p < 0.05). Under unoccluded conditions, control and Stokoderm pre-treated skin absorption rates were 4.41 +/- 1.90 and 36.84 +/- 15.19 microg x cm(-2) x h(-1) (p < 0.05). Novel (perfluorinated) barrier creams were generally more effective under unoccluded conditions; pre-treatment with one formulation led to an 18-fold reduction in skin absorption rate and reduced the total amount of SM penetrated by 95% of the applied dose. Several proprietary formulations also had adverse effects on the effectiveness of the skin decontaminant fuller's earth. The rate (Jss) and total amount (percentage of dose) of SM absorbed through the skin were deemed to be independent parameters of barrier cream performance. These data indicate that (1) perceived conditions of use, (2) compatibility with existing protective equipment and (3) the rate and extent of SM skin absorption must all be taken into account when evaluating barrier creams in vitro. "
"Abstract: The efficacy of all-trans-retinoic acid (tRA) and all-trans-retinoyl beta-glucuronide (RAG), a water-soluble metabolite of vitamin A, in the topical treatment of acne is comparable. However, whereas 3.3 mM tRA shows side effects, 3.3 mM RAG does not. To assess the relative toxic and histologic effects (dermal and epidermal changes) of long-term (24-week) daily applications of tRA and RAG on the skin, separate skin patches were measured and marked dorsally on the skin of six 21-day-old, castrated male pigs. Each skin patch area was treated daily with a cream formulation containing either 3.3 mM RAG, 16.5 mM RAG, 33 mM RAG, 3.3 mM tRA, 16.5 mM tRA or blank cream. To serve as controls, one patch received no treatment, one patch received blank cream only and for 5.3 weeks one 'washed' patch was given daily application of 33 mM RAG with routine cleansing using a mild soap typical of skin care. The amount of cream used per square centimeter remained the same during the course of the study. Biopsy tissue was collected at -1, 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks from 7 test patches. The 'washed' patch was biopsied once at the 5.3-week mark. Topically applied RAG cream (3.3 mM) resulted in significantly lower histologic scores when compared with scores from tissue treated with an equimolar concentration of tRA. The highest concentration of RAG tested (33.3 mM) resulted in a response comparable to that observed in the lowest tRA (3.3 mM) treated patch area. Daily cleansing of the test area receiving 33.3 mM RAG completely eliminated any clinical signs or negative histologic changes. In conclusion, long-term topical tRA treatment in young pigs, as in humans, showed dose-dependent adverse effects on the skin, whereas RAG treatment had significantly lower histologic changes and less irritation and/or inflammation.

"BACKGROUND: Studies suggest that retinoic acid (RA) can augment the antitumor effects of interferon-based therapy in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RC); however, this benefit has not been achieved convincingly using oral formulations of 13-cis RA and all-trans RA. Liposome-encapsulated all-trans RA (ATRA-IV) has improved pharmacokinetics with increased and prolonged ATRA serum levels compared with oral retinoids. METHODS: Cohorts of 3-6 patients with progressive metastatic RC received a dose of 3 MU interferon alpha2b per day subcutaneously, which was escalated weekly to 5 MU and then to 10 MU, plus ATRA-IV beginning at a dose of 90 mg/m(2) intravenously three times per week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), with a planned escalation to a maximum of 140 mg/m(2). RESULTS: Two of the initial five patients experienced Grade 3 leukopenia while receiving 3 MU interferon and 90 mg/m(2) ATRA-IV. Therefore, the trial was amended to begin ATRA-IV at a dose of 15 mg/m(2) three times per week with a planned escalation by 15 mg/m(2) per cohort plus interferon-alpha at a dose of 3 MU subcutaneously 5 days per week (Monday through Friday), which was escalated weekly to 5 MU and then to 10 MU. Twelve patients were treated on the revised schedule. Toxicity was mild and included Grade 2 anemia (n = 7 patients), leukopenia (n = 2 patients), nausea (n = 2 patients), fatigue (n = 2 patients), fever (n = 2 patients), hepatic toxicity (n = 1 patient), edema (n = 1 patient), neurocortical toxicity (n = 1 patient), headache (n = 1 patient), and infection (n = 1 patient). One patient developed hyperthyroidism, and one patient required admission for bacteremia from a line infection. Dose limiting toxicity was Grade 3 hepatic toxicity, which was observed at a dose of 30 mg/m(2) ATRA-IV in 2 of 6 patients. Only 2 of 12 patients agreed to a dose escalation up to 10 MU interferon-alpha. Of 12 patients who were evaluable for response, 2 patients (17%) had a partial response in bone and lung, including 1 partial response of > 91 weeks' duration, at a dose of 15 mg/m(2) ATRA-IV three times per week and 5 MU interferon-alpha. Five additional patients experienced stable disease, two of whom had disease progression in bone only. CONCLUSIONS: The acceptable toxicity profile and preliminary efficacy results suggest that this regimen warrants further evaluation. ATRA-IV (15 mg/m(2) TIW) and interferon-alpha (3 MU Monday through Friday escalated weekly to 5 MU and to 7 MU) are recommended for further study in patients with advanced RC. "
"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new systemic formulation of cyclosporin A (CsA)-loaded microspheres in a rat model of penetrating keratoplasty rejection. METHODS: Female Lewis rats received orthotopic corneal allografts from inbred female Fisher donors. The rats were divided into three groups: 1, untreated controls; 2, daily subcutaneous injection of 10 mg/kg of the commercially intravenous CsA formulation starting after surgery (time 0) and for 15 days; and 3, one subcutaneous injection of 150 mg/kg of CsA microspheres. The grafts were evaluated clinically for 30 days and the rejection index, mean survival time, and rejection rate were calculated. Serum levels of CsA were measured at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 days in groups 2 and 3. Eyes, liver, and kidneys were histologically evaluated at the end of the experiment. RESULTS: Graft rejection was significantly reduced in group 3 at day 30 (P < 0.05) and serum levels of CsA were constant (range, 73.28 +/- 43.93 to 183.33 +/- 83.69 ng/ml). High levels (>3000 ng/ml) were obtained in group 2 as long as CsA was injected. Both formulations delayed rejection onset, but only the microspheres decreased the rate of corneal graft rejection (100% in group 2 and 70% in group 3 at day 30). Histologic examination showed no hepatic lesions with either formulation, but both resulted in deposition of a hemoglobin-like material in the kidneys. CONCLUSIONS: Although subcutaneous CsA-loaded microspheres delay rejection onset and decrease the rate of corneal graft rejection in an orthotopic keratoplasty rejection model in rats, administration of the microspheres did not prevent acute renal toxicity. "
"Abstract: Inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase by mycophenolate compounds results in potent immunosuppression, as demonstrated by the efficacy of the marketed prodrug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in clinical allotransplantation. Side effects are well-known and include bone marrow depression and gastrointestinal intolerability. Mycophenolate sodium (MPS) is in clinical development as an enteric-coated formulation to alleviate this gastrointestinal adverse effect. Accompanying this development, MPS and MMF were evaluated in a tolerability study in rats and in efficacy studies in rat allo- and xenotransplantation models. The compounds were given either singly or in combination with cyclosporine A and were efficacious in the prevention of allo- or xeno-graft rejection, but with a rather narrow window between optimal immunosuppression and adverse side effects. For instance, the minimal effective dose to prevent rejection of a kidney or heart allograft or a hamster heart xenograft is a daily dose of 10-20 mg/kg MPS, at which dose the first adverse side effects can be observed: the compound at 40 mg/kg is not tolerated. This window is even narrower for MMF than for MPS, and in most models, a minimal effective MMF dose could not be established. The window between optimal immunosuppression and adverse side effects is larger when the compounds are given in combination with cyclosporine A: in all models investigated combinations were established yielding long-term survival without histologic signs of rejection and without signs of side effects. Thus, the combination of an IMPDH inhibitor (MPS, MMF) and a calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine A) enables fine-tuning in achieving optimal immunosuppression avoiding drug side effects. "
"Abstract: The Research Institute for Fragrance Materials Inc. (RIFM) has approached sensitization studies with fragrance materials as primary prevention of sensitization in the healthy, normal population. Secondary prevention, or avoidance of elicitation, most often suggested by dermatologists for patients presenting with dermatitis, has not been part of its program effort. Historically, RIFM evaluated the sensitization potential of fragrance materials using the human maximization test method; no animal models were used. In general, petrolatum was used as the vehicle. This is a harsh procedure whose main use may provide a measure of the uppermost limits of sensitization. Treating skin with sodium lauryl sulfate may be problematic and finding a laboratory to conduct the study may also be difficult. In addition, using a human predictive test method for both hazard and safety assessments is not ideal. The current practice involves a hazard assessment using an animal model, followed by a safety assessment in a human repeated-insult patch test (HRIPT). The animal test method is used to identify the sensitization potential and a no-effect level. Following a review of the no-effect level and the maximum skin level, a safety assessment in humans can be conducted. RIFM also modified the original vehicle used in sensitization testing, since petrolatum presents two major difficulties: solubility and inconsistent effects on skin penetration. Since the greatest exposure to fragrance materials is considered to be from a cologne-type product, ethanol was chosen as a more realistic vehicle. Further modification resulted in combinations of ethanol and diethyl phthalate, due to diethyl phthalate's use in many perfume formulations as a solvent and fluidizer. Human testing should not be conducted as a hazard assessment. If conducted as a safety study, induction of sensitization should be a rare occurrence. Thus, follow-up studies are not meaningful since the number of sensitized volunteers would be low. However, following a series of the RIPTs with various concentrations of hydroxycitronellal, RIFM identified a group of 41 individuals who became sensitized. An extensive 3-phase use study, with 3 diagnostic patch tests and 4 whole-body dermatological examinations showed that most subjects were able to use a bar soap, a moisurizing lotion and cologne-type products with up to 1% hydroxycitronellal. In subjects where sensitization was induced by predictive testing, no serious recurring adverse dermatological conditions developed. "
"Abstract: In this study, we compared a new combination ointment containing both calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate with betamethasone dipropionate ointment (Diprosone) and calcipotriol ointment (Daivonex) in patients with psoriasis vulgaris; 1106 patients were randomized to twice daily double-blind treatment with combination, betamethasone dipropionate or calcipotriol for 4 weeks. Patients then received twice daily calcipotriol, unblinded, for a further 4 weeks. Mean percentage change in PASI at end of the double-blind phase was -74.4 (combination group), -61.3 (betamethasone group) and -55.3 (calcipotriol group). Mean difference (95% Cl) combination-betamethasone was -13.1 (-16.9 to -9.3, p < 0.001) and for combination-calcipotriol -19.0 (-22.8 to -15.2, p <0.001). The differences in PASI were also statistically significant after 1 week. In the double-blind phase, 8.1% of patients (combination) reported lesional/ perilesional adverse reactions compared to 4.7% (betamethasone) and 12.0% (calcipotriol). In the combination group, mean PASI at the end of the double-blind phase was 2.5, and at end of the unblinded phase 3.6, compared with 3.9 and 4.1 (betamethasone) and 4.4 and 3.7 (calcipotriol). Calcipotriol/betamethasone combination is more effective and has a more rapid onset of action than either active constituent used alone, and is well tolerated. It is safe to transfer patients from combination to calcipotriol, with maintenance of clinical effect. "
"BACKGROUND: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) includes several lymphoproliferative disorders involving mature T-lymphocyte proliferation initially confined to the cutis. These affections, after variable periods, may progress to the blood, limph nodes and visceral organs. Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most frequent form of CTCL and has an indolent clinical course. The therapy of CTCL depends on the stage of the disease and the patient's general conditions. For advanced cases it includes chemotherapy, retinoids, and interferon-alpha. Since 1987 extracorporeal photochemotherapy (ECP), a novel immunomodulatory approach based on apheresis and photoirradiation of leukocytes, has been successfully introduced for the treatment of advanced CTCL. It can prolong survival of patients with erythrodermic CTCL without significant side effects. OBJECTIVE: To review our five-year experience with ECP in CTCL. METHODS: Since June 1994, 33 CTCL patients have been recruited for ECP, using two different regimens: two procedures on two consecutive days at four-week intervals for six months, or at two-week intervals for three months with progressive tapering in the second three-month period for the more severe forms. Six patients received ECP with IFN-alpha. ECP was done using the photopheresis UVAR system and UVAR XTS (Therakos, West Chester, Pa) and always with 8-MOP liquid formulation injected directly into the buffy coat bag. Lymphocytes in peripheral blood were immunophenotypically characterized for each patient and every ECP session. RESULTS: All patients tolerated ECP well, without significant side effects. Thirty patients are clinically evaluable (at least three ECP cycles). A favourable clinical response was obtained in 80.9% (16/21) of MF patients (complete response 33%, partial response 47.6%) and in 66% (6/9) of patients in the Sézary's syndrome phase (complete response 33.3%, partial response 33.3%). Five of the six patients given IFN-alpha as adjunctive therapy had a PR and one a CR. Four patients are in CR without therapy at follow-ups of 46, 20, 10 and 8 months. There have been no changes in the peripheral lymphocyte immunophenotype during the follow-up. In 19/30 patients the CD95 antigen, correlated with cellular apoptosis, was expressed and was frequently associated with a good clinical response. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience ECP achieved favourable clinical responses in 73% of patients, in monotherapy or in combination with IFN-alpha, without significant side effects. "
"BACKGROUND: The worldwide prevalence of asthma is increasing by approximately 50% per decade. Budesonide is one of several inhaled corticosteroids available for the treatment of asthma and has been extensively evaluated in clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the published literature on the efficacy of budesonide in the management of adult and pediatric patients with moderate to severe asthma and compares budesonide with other inhaled corticosteroids and nonsteroidal treatment options. METHODS: All controlled, randomized studies in patients with moderate or severe asthma were considered for inclusion. Relevant studies were identified through a MEDLINE search of the period from 1980 to 2000 using the terms budesonide plus efficacy, with or without the termsfluticasone, mometasone, and beclomethasone. The manufacturer's reference database was used to identify additional publications. RESULTS: Budesonide is associated with a dose-response effect in adults and children with moderate to severe asthma. The data on budesonide are in line with the current recommendation for a high starting dose of inhaled corticosteroid (800 microg/d), followed by downward titration to the minimal effective dose. Budesonide administered by Turbuhaler (AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, Wilmington, Del) dry-powder inhaler (DPI) was effective at a significantly lower dose than beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) administered by pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) (P = 0.009), whereas its efficacy was similar to that of BDP delivered by hydrofluoroalkane pMDI and that of fluticasone propionate administered by DPI. Inhaled budesonide therapy was shown to be oral corticosteroid sparing in patients with severe asthma, thus reducing the total corticosteroid dose and the risk of systemic side effects. Pulmicort Respules (AstraZeneca), a nebulized formulation, was effective in the treatment of moderate to severe asthma in patients aged > or =12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Once- or twice-daily administration of budesonide delivered via the Turbuhaler and Pulmicort Respules systems has been shown to be well tolerated and efficacious in populations with moderate to severe asthma.

"Abstract: Pimecrolimus, an ascomycin macrolactam derivative, is an inhibitor of T-cell and mast-cell activation, developed and launched by Novartis for the potential treatment of psoriasis and allergic, irritant and atopic dermatitis. The topical formulation had been launched in the US by February 2002 for mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis in patients aged two years and older. At that time, an oral formulation was in development for which launch was anticipated for 2006. In March 2002, pimecrolimus was approved in Denmark, becoming the first non-steroid prescription cream approved for patients from as young as 3 months of age through to adulthood. At this time, Novartis planned to seek approvals in other European countries during 2002 under the Mutual Recognition Procedure, and elsewhere around the globe. In December 2000, Merrill Lynch predicted sales of SFr 100 million in 2002, rising to SFr 330 million in 2004, and in February 2001, the analysts predicted sales of SFr 120 million in 2002, rising to SFr 574 million in 2005. Later in August 2001, Deutsche Bank estimated sales of SFr 150 million in 2002, rising to SFr 550 million in 2005. Following FDA approval in 2002, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter cautiously predicted sales of SFr 60 million rising to SFr 860 million by 2007. "
"BACKGROUND: So-called darkened age spots encompass distinct pathological processes. The efficacy of topical depigmenting agents is difficult to objectivate. OBJECTIVE: To assess the hypopigmenting effect of three cosmetic formulations using objective biometrological methods. METHODS: 50 women of South-East Asian ancestry were enrolled in this pilot study. They had solar lentigines according to dermoscopic criteria. The lesions were treated by topical hypopigmenting formulations. Products were applied twice daily for 2 or 3 months. Assessments at 1-month intervals were made using narrow-band reflectance spectrophotometry, image analysis of video-recorded ultraviolet light reflection and photodensitometry- and image-analysis-assisted corneomelametry. RESULTS: A 20% azelaic acid formulation and another one containing 5% ascorbyl glucosamine, 1% kojic acid and alpha-hydroxyacid esters appeared inefficacious on solar lentigines. A stabilized soy extract showed a better although modest lightening effect when assessed by corneomelametry. The subclinical or faint mottled skin revealed by ultraviolet light examination better responded (p < 0.05) to treatments. CONCLUSION: Focal epidermal hyperpigmentation is better controlled by topical whitening agents when the increase in melanin content reflects a modest functional hyperactivity of melanocytes. "
"Abstract: Coricidin products seemed to be one of the over-the-counter medications being reportedly abused by adolescents, as observed from the Texas Poison Center Network data. This retrospective chart review investigated the occurrence of abuse, developed a patient profile, and defined the clinical effects resulting from the abuse of Coricidin products. Data collected from the Texas Poison Center Network Toxic Exposure Surveillance System database included human exposures between 1998 and 1999, patients > or = 10y old, intentional use or abuse, and single substance ingestion of I of the tablet formulations of Coricidin. Thirty-three cases from 1998 and 59 cases from 1999 were reviewed. Of these cases, 85% met the inclusion criteria. Of the 7 medications searched, only 4 substances were coded for: Coricidin D, Coricidin D (long acting), Coricidin D (cold, flu & sinus) and Coriciding HBP. These contain a combination of dextromethorphan hydrobromide, chlorpheniramine maleate, phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride, and acetaminophen. Of the 78 cases, 63% were male and 38% were female. The mean age was 14.67 years, 77% being between 13 to 17 years old. Eighteen different symptoms were reported: tachycardia 50%, somnolence 24.4%, mydriasis and hypertension 16.7%, agitation 12.8%, disorientation 10.3%, slurred speech 9%, ataxia 6.4%, vomiting 5.1%, dry mouth and hallucinations 3.9%, tremor 2.6%, and headache, dizziness, syncope, seizure, chest pain, and nystagmus each 1.3%; 12.8% of the calls originated from the school nurse. The incidence of abuse reported increased 60% from 1998 to 1999. This worrisome trend suggests increased abuse of these products. "
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate CC2 (N, N'-dichloro-bis [2, 4, 6-trichlorophenyl] urea) in various hydrophilic and lipophilic formulations as a personnel decontaminant for sulphur mustard (SM). METHODS: Twenty percent of CC2 was prepared as a suspension or ointment with various chemical agents and its stability was evaluated by active chlorine assay. The efficacy was evaluated in mice by recording the mortality after applying 29 LD50 of SM (LD50 = 8.1 mg/kg dermally) and decontaminating it after 2 min with 200 mg of the formulation. Studies were also carried out with 10% and 20% CC2 in acacia and hydroxypropyl cellulose, and the suspensions were stored in polyethylene containers. The stability of the suspensions was evaluated by active chlorine assay. The efficacy was evaluated by recording the mortality after applying 29 LD50 of SM in mice and 12 LD50 of SM in rats (LD50 = 2.4 mg/kg dermally), and decontaminating it with the formulations. LD50 by different routes and primary skin irritation test of CC2 were also carried out. RESULTS: CC2 reacted with peanut oil and neem oil, and was unstable in povidone iodine and Fuller's earth. Good stability was achieved with petroleum jelly, honey, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, calamine lotion, acacia and hydroxypropyl cellulose. Though CC2 was stable in lipophilic formulations, it did not protect the animals. The hydrophilic formulations particularly acacia and hydroxypropyl cellulose gave very good protection and was stable in the polyethylene containers for a period of 1 year. The efficacy of 20% CC2 was better than 10% CC2. The oral and dermal LD50 of CC2 was found to be above 5.0 g/kg. CC2 was also found to be nonirritant. CONCLUSION: Twenty percent of CC2 in hydroxypropyl cellulose is better with respect to stability, efficacy and ease of decontamination. CC2 is also a safe chemical. "
"Abstract: Povidone-iodine (PVP-I) is an antiseptic which has been widely used in various fields. It was reported to have a weaker skin irritancy than other antiseptics in the Draize skin irritation test using rabbits. Recent increased concern for animal welfare requires us to use skin models in the tests as an alternative to animal testing. Actually, there are some skin models already commercialized, which are available to evaluate skin irritancy caused by e.g. chemical reagents, cosmetics or medicines. In this study, we evaluated the potential of a PVP-I solution and other antiseptics to cause irritation using a cultured human skin model (three-dimensional skin model) under conditions similar to clinical use. This skin model has two layers like a real skin, such as the dermis and epidermis which includes the cornified layer. For the evaluation of skin irritancy in this model, cell viability was evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay as an endpoint. Antiseptic formulations such as benzalkonium chloride (BAC), benzethonium chloride (BEC), chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) and alkyldiaminoethylglycine hydrochloride (AEG) were used in this study. As a result, PVP-I showed a significantly weaker skin irritancy compared to the other antiseptics. The present in vitro study results revealed a correlation with the results of previously conducted in vivo skin irritancy tests using rabbits. "
"BACKGROUND: Several clinical trials have established the benefit of using a topical corticosteroid in conjunction with tazarotene gel in the treatment of plaque psoriasis. However, there is little information comparing the relative benefits of different corticosteroids, or different formulations of corticosteroids, when used adjunctively with tazarotene. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to compare the clinical benefits achieved with each of six commonly prescribed high- or mid-high-potency corticosteroid creams and ointments applied in conjunction with tazarotene 0.1% gel in the treatment of patients with stable plaque psoriasis. METHODS: A 12-week, multicenter, investigator-masked, randomized, parallel-group study was performed with more than 200 patients who were randomly assigned to regimens of tazarotene 0.1% gel alone, tazarotene plus a high-potency topical corticosteroid (fluocinonide 0.05% ointment, mometasone furoate 0.1% ointment, or diflorasone diacetate 0.05% ointment), or tazarotene plus a mid-high-potency topical corticosteroid (betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% cream, fluticasone propionate 0.005% ointment, or diflorasone diacetate 0.05% cream). All medications were to be applied once daily: corticosteroids in the morning, tazarotene gel in the evening. At assessment visits, physicians made an overall evaluation of the patient's psoriasis and graded global improvement, plaque elevation, scaling, erythema, and pruritus. Patients also rated their treatment in terms of efficacy, tolerability, and satisfaction. RESULTS: The best-performing steroid was betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% cream (a mid-high-potency steroid), followed by mometasone furoate 0.1% ointment (a high-potency steroid) and diflorasone diacetate 0.05% ointment (a high-potency steroid). Maximum improvements were achieved within 8 weeks. The best-tolerated regimen was tazarotene plus mometasone furoate 0.1% ointment and the optimal balance between efficacy and tolerability was achieved with this regimen. CONCLUSION: Some steroids are considerably more effective than others in optimizing the efficacy and tolerability of tazarotene therapy. With a suitable combination regimen, the duration of initial therapy (before maintenance therapy is started) need not be prolonged. "

"Abstract: Topical photodynamic therapy (PDT) is effective in the treatment of certain non-melanoma skin cancers and is under evaluation in other dermatoses. Its development has been enhanced by a low rate of adverse events and good cosmesis. 5-Aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) is the main agent used, converted within cells into the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX, with surface illumination then triggering the photodynamic reaction. Despite the relative simplicity of the technique, accurate dosimetry in PDT is complicated by multiple variables in drug formulation, delivery and duration of application, in addition to light-specific parameters. Several non-coherent and coherent light sources are effective in PDT. Optimal disease-specific irradiance, wavelength and total dose characteristics have yet to be established, and are compounded by difficulties comparing light sources. The carcinogenic risk of ALA-PDT appears to be low. Current evidence indicates topical PDT to be effective in actinic keratoses on the face and scalp, Bowen's disease and superficial basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). PDT may prove advantageous where size, site or number of lesions limits the efficacy and/or acceptability of conventional therapies. Topical ALA-PDT alone is a relatively poor option for both nodular BCCs and squamous cell carcinomas. Experience of the modality in other skin diseases remains limited; areas where there is potential benefit include viral warts, acne, psoriasis and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. A recent British Photodermatology Group workshop considered published evidence on topical PDT in order to establish guidelines to promote the efficacy and safety of this increasingly practised treatment modality.

"BACKGROUND: Granuloma annulare is a granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. Various therapies have been tried in disseminated granuloma annulare (DGA), including corticosteroids, several variants of psoralen plus ultraviolet-A radiation, ultraviolet- A1 radiation, systemic retinoids, and dapsone, with variable success. We report a patient with recalcitrant DGA who was treated with fumaric acid esters (FAE). CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year old Caucasian woman presented with a 25-year history of recalcitrant DGA. On both legs and the abdomen there were erythematous annular plaques. She was treated with FAE in tablet form using two formulations differing in strength (low strength tablets: 30 mg dimethylfumarate, 67 mg monoethylfumarate Ca salt, 5 mg monoethylfumarate Mg salt, 3 mg monoethylfumarate Zn salt; high strength tablets: 120 mg dimethylfumarate, 87 mg monoethylfumarate Ca salt, 5 mg monoethylfumarate Mg salt, 3 mg monoethylfumarate Zn salt). After three-month therapy, an almost complete clearance of skin lesions was achieved. With the exception of temporary lymphopenia, no adverse effects were observed. The patient remained in remission during a six-month follow up period. CONCLUSIONS: Our observation has demonstrated that FAE is a potentially beneficial therapeutic option for patients with recalcitrant DGA. However controlled trials are necessary to fully explore the efficacy, optimal dosage, and safety of FAE in the management of DGA. "
"Abstract: Salicylic acid is used in chemical peeling procedures. However, they have caused many side effects, even salicylism. To achieve a salicylic acid peeling that would be safer for topical use, we recently developed a new formulation consisting of 30% salicylic acid in polyethylene glycol (PEG) vehicle. In an extension of our previous research, we studied the absorption of 30% salicylic acid labeled with 14C in PEG vehicle applied topically to the intact and damaged skin of male hairless mice. An ointment containing 3 mg salicylic acid in 10 mg vehicle was applied to both groups. In animals with intact skin, 1 h after application the plasma concentration of radioactivity was 1665.1 ng eq/ml, significantly lower than the 21437.6 ng eq/ml observed in mice with damaged skin. Microautoradiograms of intact skin showed that the level of radioactivity in the cornified cell layer was similar at 6 h after application. However, in damaged skin, the overall level of radioactivity showed a decrease by 3 h after application. In the carcasses remaining after the treated intact and damaged skin had been removed, 0.09 and 11.38% of the applied radioactivity remained, respectively. These findings confirm that 30% salicylic acid in PEG vehicle is little absorbed through the intact skin of hairless mice, and suggest that salicylism related to absorption through the skin of quantities of topically applied salicylic acid is not likely to occur in humans with intact skin during chemical peeling with this preparation. This new preparation of 30% salicylic acid in PEG vehicle is believed to be safe for application as a chemical peeling agent. "
"Abstract: In photodynamic therapy, one of the problems limiting the use of many photosensitizers (PS) is the difficulty in preparing pharmaceutical formulations that enable their parenteral administration. Due to their low water solubility, the hydrophobic PS cannot be simply injected intravenously. Different strategies, including polymer-PS conjugation or encapsulation of the drug in colloidal carriers such as oil-dispersions, liposomes and polymeric particles, have been investigated. Although these colloidal carriers tend to accumulate selectively in tumour tissues, they are rapidly taken up by the mononuclear phagocytic system. In order to reduce this undesirable uptake by phagocytic cells, long-circulating carriers that consist of surface modified carriers have been developed. Moreover, considerable effort has been directed towards using other types of carriers to improve tumour targeting and to minimize the side effects. One of the approaches is to entrap PS into the lipophilic core of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) without altering their biological properties. The LDL receptor pathway is an important factor in the selective accumulation of PS in tumour tissue owing to the increased number of LDL receptors on the proliferating cell surface. Specific targeting can also be achieved by binding of monoclonal antibodies or specific tumour-seeking molecules to PS or by the coating of PS loaded carriers. "
"BACKGROUND: In previous comparative studies tacrolimus was superior to the standard formulation of ciclosporin in preventing acute rejection after renal transplantation. We have compared the microemulsion formulation of ciclosporin with tacrolimus in a multicentre randomised trial. METHODS: The 6-month open study involved 560 patients in 50 European centres. 287 patients were randomly assigned tacrolimus and 273 ciclosporin microemulsion plus azathioprine and corticosteroids. The initial oral daily doses were 0.30 mg/kg for tacrolimus and 8-10 mg/kg for ciclosporin. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with biopsy-proven acute rejection and the time to this event. FINDINGS: The two study groups were similar in terms of baseline characteristics. Three patients did not receive study treatment or did not undergo transplantation (one tacrolimus, two ciclosporin). The rate of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection was significantly lower with tacrolimus than with ciclosporin microemulsion (56 patients [19.6%] vs 101 [37.3%]; 17.7% difference [95% CI 10.3-25.1]; p<0.0001). Biopsy-confirmed corticosteroid-resistant rejection was also significantly lower with tacrolimus (27 [9.4%] vs 57 [21.0%]; 11.6% difference [5.7-17.5]; p<0.0001). Cross-over between therapies because of biopsy-proven rejection was judged necessary in one of 286 (0.3%) tacrolimus-group patients and 27 of 271 (10.0%) ciclosporin-group patients (p<0.0001). There were no significant differences in survival of patients or grafts or in renal function. The overall frequency of adverse events was similar in the two groups, though hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia were more common in the ciclosporin group and tremor and hypomagnesaemia were more frequent in the tacrolimus group. INTERPRETATION: Tacrolimus was significantly more effective than ciclosporin microemulsion in preventing acute rejection after renal transplantation and had a superior cardiovascular-risk profile. "
"Abstract: As DNA damage induced by ultraviolet radiation plays an essential role in skin cancer induction, we pursued the measure of several DNA lesions induced by ultraviolet radiation in human skin for determining the efficacy of different topical photoprotectors. Non-exposed skin (buttocks from 20 individuals) was exposed to 10 doses of ultraviolet, which corresponded to three to four minimal erythema doses of solar-simulating radiation, and biopsies were taken at 24 h within the half and one minimal erythema dose sites and a nonirradiated, adjacent control area. We report that even suberythemal doses of ultraviolet radiation are capable of inducing substantial DNA damage, namely pyrimidine dimers, p53 induction, and the DNA base-modified product generated by oxidative stress, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. All three lesions are induced in a dose-dependent manner. An additional eight individuals were treated with either ultraviolet B or ultraviolet B + ultraviolet A sunblock (sun protection factor 15) and exposed to 71/2 and 15 times the minimal erythema dose on each individual, with biopsies taken at 24 h post-ultraviolet. Pyrimidine dimer and p53 expression were rarely seen in nonirradiated skin but occasional staining was seen in all normal skin for 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. Applications of sunscreens to human skin before irradiation were shown to attenuate erythema but did not completely eliminate all three types of cellular damage when tested up to their sun protection factor 15. Furthermore, ultraviolet B + ultraviolet A sunscreens were less efficient than the ultraviolet B alone formulation for protection against all three lesions. These results suggest that DNA damage assessed in vivo by immunohistochemistry provides a very sensitive endpoint for determining the efficacy or photosensitivity of possible different protective measures in human skin.

"Abstract: Local delivery systems of antimicrobial agents for treatment of the periodontal diseases received considerable attention during the past decade due to the disadvantages of the systemic administration. An ideal formulation should exhibit ease of delivery, a good retention at the application site, and a controlled release of the drug. The application of bioadhesive gels provides a long stay in the oral cavity, adequate drug penetration, high efficacy and acceptability. In dentistry and oral medicine, various applications of chitosan, which is a bioadhesive polymer have been proposed due to its favorable properties such as biocompatibility and biodegradability. The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of chitosan formulations either in gel or film form against a periodontal pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis. The viscosity, bioadhesive properties and antimicrobial activity of chitosans at different molecular weight and deacetylation degree were evaluated in the absence or presence of chlorhexidine gluconate (Chx), incorporated into the formulations at 0.1 and 0.2% concentrations. The flow property of the gels were found to be suitable for topical application on the oral mucosa and to syringe into the periodontal pocket. Bioadhesion of the gels and films examined ex-vivo using fresh porcine buccal mucosa showed that both the film and gel formulations exert bioadhesive properties and was not affected by incorporation of Chx. Chitosan is shown to have an antimicrobial activity against P. gingivalis and this was higher with high molecular weight chitosan. The combination of chitosan with Chx showed a higher activity when compared to that of Chx alone, which would provide Chx application at lower concentrations thus avoiding its unwanted side effects. Chitosan films and gels seem to be promising delivery systems for local therapy of periodontal diseases with its bioadhesive property and antimicrobial activity. "
"Abstract: Nickel (Ni)-induced allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) was performed in human volunteers to study the role of moisturisers in preventing ACD-related skin barrier damage. 15 Ni-sensitive females (mean age: 29.5 years; range: 23-38) were included. On days 1, 21, 24 and 26, TEWL, stratum corneum (SC)-capacitance and clinical score were evaluated on four test sites on the right and left forearms. Both a highly and a poorly hydrating moisturising formulation were applied on two sites from days 1 to 21, after which Ni-ACD was induced on the 2 pre-treated sites and one non-treated area. On day 24, TEWL values were significantly increased on the site pre-treated with poorly hydrating product compared to the rich formulation pre-treated site. SC-hydration was significantly improved on the latter site on days 21, 23 and 26. Long-term use of inadequate moisturiser increases skin barrier damage due to Ni-ACD. "
"Abstract: In 40 volunteers the efficacy of three lotions with 10% hamamelis distillates from different suppliers, two vehicles, dimethindene maleate 0.1% gel, hydrocortisone 1% cream and hydrocortisone 0.25% lotion were investigated in a modified UV erythema test with three UV dosages (1.2, 1.4 and 1.7 MED). The test preparations were applied occlusively over a 48-hour period following irradiation. Chromametric measurement of redness and visual assessment were performed 24, 48 and 72 h after induction of erythema. The hydrocortisone formulations were most effective in erythema suppression. An anti- inflammatory effect was noted for all three hamamelis lotions as well as for the vehicles. A significantly greater suppression of erythema than seen with the vehicles was noted for one of the hamamelis lotions at 1.4 MED. The efficacy of the antihistamine dimethindene maleate did not surpass the hamamelis lotions or the vehicles. Even though the differences between the hamamelis lotions were slight, it was possible to make an objective selection of the best hamamelis distillate for aftersun purposes. "
"Abstract: Seretide (Advair [North America], GlaxoSmithKline) is an inhaler combination formulation intended for the maintenance therapy of obstructive airways disease. Seretide was developed and made available initially as three multi-dose, dry powder inhaler formulations delivering 50 microg/puff of the long acting beta(2) agonist salmeterol and either 100, 250 or 500 microg/puff of the inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone propionate. In addition to the initial multi-dose dry powder inhaler system (Diskus or Accuhaler), a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-free pressurised aerosol formulation has become available. Studied mostly extensively as a maintenance therapy for patients with persistent asthma, the combination inhaler is at least equivalent to its components administered separately and is superior to monotherapy with salmeterol or inhaled corticosteroid in both paediatric and adult populations. The combination has a logical role in the treatment of moderate-to-severe asthma, offering the advantage of increased convenience and possibly improved compliance. In addition to improvements in lung function, symptom scores and quality of life, the combination therapy reduces exacerbation rates, an outcome that contributes to favourable cost-effectiveness. A role as initial maintenance therapy in all forms of persistent asthma is also plausible but there are fewer data concerning the impact of Seretide in milder forms of persistent asthma. Clinical trials are underway to examine the potential role of Seretide in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Salmeterol has been shown to be an effective first-line bronchodilator in COPD and fluticasone has been shown to reduce the frequency and or severity of exacerbations in COPD patients in two key trials. At a time when the prevalence of both asthma and COPD is increasing, Seretide is a valuable step in the management of these common obstructive lung diseases. "
"Abstract: The pathogen inactivation process developed by Cerus and Baxter Healthcare Corporations uses the psoralen, S-59 (amotosalen) in an ex vivo photochemical treatment (PCT) process to inactivate viruses, bacteria, protozoans, and leukocytes in platelet concentrates and plasma. Studies were performed by intravenous infusion of S-59 PCT formulations +/- compound adsorption device (CAD) treatment and with non-UVA illuminated S-59, using doses that were multiples of potential clinical exposures. The studies comprised full pharmacokinetic, single- and repeated-dose (up to 13 weeks duration) toxicity, safety pharmacology (CNS, renal, and cardiovascular), reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity testing in the p53(+/-) mouse, vein irritation, and phototoxicity. No specific target organ toxicity (clinical or histopathological), reproductive toxicity, or carcinogenicity was observed. S-59 and/or PCT formulations demonstrated CNS, ECG, and phototoxicity only at supraclinical doses. Based on the extremely large safety margins (>30,000-fold expected clinical exposures), the CNS and ECG observations are not considered to have any toxicological relevance. Additionally, after a complete assessment, mutagenicity and phototoxicity results are not considered relevant for the proposed use of INTERCEPT platelets. Thus, the results of an extensive series of in vitro and in vivo studies have not demonstrated any toxicologically relevant effects of platelet concentrates prepared by the INTERCEPT system. "
"Abstract: Adapalene gel 0.1% is approved for use in the treatment of acne vulgaris. A new cream formulation, adapalene cream 0.1%, has been developed. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of adapalene cream 0.1% in comparison with its cream vehicle, applied once daily for 12 weeks to patients with facial acne vulgaris. We used a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, comparative phase 3 study of adapalene cream 0.1% and cream vehicle. The study enrolled 237 patients (125 males and 112 females), aged 12 through 30 years, with mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris. Adapalene cream 0.1% demonstrated superior efficacy compared with its cream vehicle. Significantly lower numbers of total inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts were observed at the end of the study period in patients using adapalene cream 0.1% as opposed to those using cream vehicle (P<.05 compared with baseline, for all 3 parameters). Adapalene cream 0.1% caused more cutaneous side effects than the cream vehicle, but these were tolerated in most patients. In summary, the results of this study indicate that adapalene cream 0.1% demonstrates superior efficacy over cream vehicle for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Adapalene cream 0.1% also has excellent tolerability and is associated with a low incidence of cutaneous adverse events. "
"Abstract: The emergence of oral and topical retinoids was a major advance in the clinical management of acne vulgaris. However, the benefits of these agents were somewhat limited by the degree of side effects caused by these drugs. Over the last 15 years, researchers have sought compounds that can provide the manifold therapeutic benefits obtained with tretinoin and isotretinoin while minimizing the potential for irritation and other unwanted effects. Adapalene, a naphthoic-acid derivative, is one result of this search, and it serves as an example of rational drug development: the formulation of a novel substance with specific pharmacological properties and clinical objectives in mind. These goals included enhancing stability, enhancing anti-inflammatory effects, maintaining effectiveness and minimizing cutaneous irritation. This paper reviews the history of the development of adapalene, its unique physical and biochemical properties, and the pharmacological studies that demonstrate a wide range of retinoid-receptor, genetic and anti-inflammatory effects, all of which contribute to the therapeutic efficacy and improved tolerability of adapalene observed in the clinical use of this agent for the treatment of acne.

"BACKGROUND: The microemulsion formulation of cyclosporin (CsA-ME) has a less variable absorption profile than the standard formulation (CsA-S), but only limited information is available about once-daily administration of CsA-ME. OBJECTIVE: To develop a population pharmacokinetic model for once-daily CsA-ME that enables the prediction of individual steady-state area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) on the basis of blood concentration measurements and patient covariates. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The steady-state pharmacokinetics of once-daily cyclosporin were studied in 60 stable renal transplant recipients before and after conversion from CsA-S to CsA-ME. For each formulation, 7 blood samples were collected from 50 patients (group A) at sparse timepoints over 2 weeks, and 10 blood samples were collected from 10 patients (group B) at fixed timepoints over 24 hours. A 2-compartment population model assuming time-lagged first-order oral absorption was fitted to the data from group A, using nonlinear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM). The data from group B were used to evaluate the predictive performance of the model. RESULTS: Mean [+/- SD; coefficient of variation (%CV)] CsA-S doses of 245mg (+/- 92) resulted in cyclosporin blood concentrations of 214 microg/L (+/- 70) after 12 hours and 108 microg/L (+/- 23) after 24 hours; the mean estimated AUC to 24 hours was 7658 microg x h/L (30%). With mean CsA-ME doses of 206mg (+/- 59), cyclosporin blood concentrations were 212 microg/L (+/- 33) and 132 microg/L (25%) after 12 and 24 hours, respectively, and the mean estimated AUC(24) was 9357 microg x h/L (23%). A strong correlation between 12-hour concentrations and AUC(24) was observed for CsA-ME (r = 0.95, p < 0.001), but not for CsA-S (r = 0.59, nonsignificant); the correlation between 24-hour trough concentrations and AUC(24) was weaker for both formulations (r = 0.64, p < 0.05 and r = 0.37, nonsignificant, respectively). On the basis of the population model derived from group A, the single best timepoint to predict AUC(24) from blood cyclosporin concentration was at 8 hours [AUC(24) (microg x h/L) = 19.6 x cyclosporin concentration at 8 hours (microg/L) + 3035], resulting in a prediction error of 8.3 +/- 6.6% when applied to the measured AUC(24) of group B. Adverse events were observed after conversion in 18 patients; these events generally resolved spontaneously or after dosage reduction, but twice-daily administration was required in some patients. CONCLUSIONS: Switching from once-daily CsA-S to CsA-ME results in more consistent and predictable cyclosporin pharmacokinetics. Adjustment of dosage or regimen may be required in some patients. "
"Abstract: Ointments of the skin depigmentation agent hydroquinone (HQ) have been prepared by extemporaneous nonsterile compounding in Japan by imitating skin lightening creams commercially available in the U.S.A. and European Union. In our hospital, HQ ointments consisting of 5 or 10% HQ, 1.6% L(+)-ascorbic acid (AsA), 0.5% (w/w) Na2SO3, 10% (v/w) glycerin and hydrophilic ointment have been prepared. However, various problems have been observed including chromatic aberration of HQ ointments, relatively large variability of efficacy, and undesirable side effects although they were mild. Herein, the pharmaceutical and clinical properties of the HQ ointments were evaluated. HQ ointments were highly effective for treatment of various types of skin pigmentation. Chromatic aberration occurred during 3 months of storage, but this could be suppressed by storage at 4 degrees C. Chromatic aberration was independent of prescribed HQ content, and was not explained by alterations of HQ or p-benzoquinone (p-BQ) contents. Unexpectedly, removal of both antioxidants resulted in suppression of chromatic aberration, but an increase in p-BQ content. Acidification by removal of Na2SO3 only was further effective for the suppression of chromatic aberration, but with a decrease of p-BQ content except in the initial period. Chromatic aberration was due to water soluble material and insoluble material both formed by co-existence of HQ and p-BQ at a molecular ratio of 5:3 to 1:1. 1H-NMR analysis elucidated that the water soluble material was not HQ or p-BQ, and the insoluble material was a complex of HQ and p-BQ with non-covalent binding.

"Abstract: Currently, topical glucocorticosteroids are the most frequently used drugs in dermatologic practice. Over the years, research has focused on strategies to optimize potency and, in particular, the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive capacity of these drugs, while minimizing adverse effects. However, 'ideal' topical corticosteroids have not yet been synthesized. They should be able to permeate the stratum corneum and reach adequate concentrations in the skin without reaching high serum concentrations. Such characteristics can be obtained by increasing the natural lipophilicity of corticosteroids, e.g. by esterification. In the past, many structural modifications have been made to improve the efficacy of topical corticosteroids to produce drugs with greater potency, although this has often been associated with a higher likelihood of adverse effects. Betamethasone dipropionate and clobetasol propionate, known as fifth-generation corticosteroids, are a typical example of potent molecules that can control specific dermatoses very rapidly, but which are associated with a high risk of topical and systemic adverse effects. Recently, steroid components have been synthesized that aim to have adequate anti-inflammatory effects and minimal adverse effects. The newest topical corticosteroids used for the treatment of different dermatoses and allergic reactions of the respiratory tract (in particular asthma) are budesonide, mometasone furoate, prednicarbate, the di-esters 17,21-hydrocortisone aceponate and hydrocortisone-17-butyrate-21-propionate, methylprednisolone aceponate, alclometasone dipropionate, and carbothioates such as fluticasone propionate. These new topical corticosteroids are evaluated in the current review, which compares the risk/benefit ratio of each molecule with established agents. The new molecules, compared with the well known and established corticosteroids, generally have a higher anti-inflammatory effect, good compliance among patients (only a once-daily application is needed), rarely induce cross-sensitivity reactions and have weak atrophogenicity.

"Abstract: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro antioxidant and in vivo photoprotective activities of an ethanolic extract of Culcitium reflexum H.B.K. leaves (ECR extract). The antioxidant activity of the extract was assessed by means of three different in vitro tests: (1) bleaching of the stable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical; (2) peroxidation, induced by the water-soluble radical initiator 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride, on mixed dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/linoleic acid unilamellar vesicles; (3) UV radiation-induced peroxidation in phosphatidylcholine multilamellar vesicles. In all in vitro tests used the ECR extract showed a significant antioxidant effect. Furthermore, a gel formulation containing this extract proved, when topically applied, to afford a significant in vivo protection against UV-B-induced skin erythema in healthy human volunteers. Then, by chromatographic fractionation and spectroscopic methods, we identified some cinnamic acid derivatives and the major flavonoid constituents of the ECR extract, viz. the flavonols rutin, quercetin-3-O-beta-D-galactopyranoside-4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, isorhamnetin-3-O-beta-D-galactopyranoside, quercetin and kaempferol.

"Abstract: Studies of the photoimmunoprotective properties of sunscreens have produced disparate results. In this study in hairless mice, we compared two UVB absorbers, 2-ethylhexyl-p-methoxycinnamate (2-EHMC) and octyl-N-dimethyl-p-aminobenzoate (o-PABA), individually formulated in a common base lotion with a sunburn protection factor of 6. We measured their capacity to protect against suppression of the contact hypersensitivity (CHS) induced by three daily exposures of the dorsum to 6x the minimal erythemal/edematous dose (MED) of solar-simulated UV radiation (SSUV), in comparison with base lotion-treated mice exposed to 3 x 1 MED of SSUV. All treatments produced a similar minimal erythema. CHS was equally suppressed in mice irradiated through o-PABA and base lotion, but the suppression was significantly reduced in mice irradiated through 2-EHMC. Neither UVB absorber inhibited the epidermal photoisomerization to the immunosuppressive mediator, cis-urocanic acid. However, when mice were treated with exogenous cis-urocanic acid topically on the dorsum, but not when injected subcutaneously on the abdomen, suppression of CHS was observed in o-PABA- and base lotion-treated mice, but not in 2-EHMC-treated mice. Thus, the enhanced immunoprotection in mice irradiated through 2-EHMC apparently resulted from the direct inactivation of epidermal cis-urocanic acid by 2-EHMC. We conclude that comparative assessment of photoimmunoprotection by UV absorbers requires SSUV, erythemally matched exposures and consideration of potential interactions with cutaneous molecules. "
"Abstract: Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Water are obtained from the Mentha piperita plant. The oil is currently used in cosmetic formulations as a fragrance component, but previously had been also described as a denaturant. The extract and leaves are described as biological additives, but only the extract is reported to be used. Peppermint Water is described as a flavoring agent or fragrance component, but is not currently in use. Peppermint Oil is used at a concentration of < or = 3% in rinse-off formulations and < or = 0.2% in leave-on formulations. Peppermint Oil is composed primarily of menthol and menthone. Other possible constituents include pulegone, menthofuran, and limone. Most of the safety test data concern Peppermint Oil. The oil is considered to present the ""worst case scenario"" because of its many constituents, so data on the oil were considered relevant to the entire group of ingredients. Peppermint Oil was minimally toxic in acute oral studies. Short-term and sub-chronic oral studies reported cystlike lesions in the cerebellum in rats that were given doses of Peppermint Oil containing pulegone, pulegone alone, or large amounts (>200 mg/kg/day) of menthone. Pulegone is also a recognized hepatotoxin. Repeated intradermal dosing with Peppermint Oil produced moderate and severe reactions in rabbits, although Peppermint Oil did not appear to be phototoxic. Peppermint Oil was negative in the Ames test and a mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay but gave equivocal results in a Chinese hamster fibroblast cell chromosome aberration assay. In a carcinogenicity study of toothpaste and its components, no apparent differences were noted between mice treated with Peppermint Oil and those treated with the toothpaste base. Isolated clinical cases of irritation and/or sensitization to Peppermint Oil and/or its constituents have been reported, but Peppermint Oil (8%) was not a sensitizer when tested using a maximization protocol. It was expected that dermal absorption of Peppermint Oil would be rapid, following that of menthol, a major component, but in no case would be greater than absorption through the gastrointestinal tract. Because of the toxicity of pulegone, the safe concentration of this constituent was limited to < or = 1%. This concentration was achievable both by controlling the time of harvest and processing technique. There is evidence that menthol can enhance penetration of other agents. Formulators were cautioned that this enhanced penetration can affect the use of other ingredients whose safety assessment was based on their lack of absorption. With the limitation that the concentration of pulegone in these ingredients should not exceed 1%, it was concluded that Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaves, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Water are safe as used in cosmetic formulations.

"Abstract: The availability of an improved oral solution and an intravenous (IV) formulation of itraconazole (Sporanox) promises to have an effect on prevention and treatment of fungal infection in immunocompromised patients. Use of itraconazole in neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies has been evaluated in a number of European studies. Treatment with IV followed by oral itraconazole resulted in response or stable disease in two-thirds of patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Empiric treatment with IV followed by oral solution itraconazole was at least as effective as, and significantly less toxic than, amphotericin B. Several studies of oral solution prophylaxis indicate effectiveness in prevention of fungal infection. Oral solution and IV itraconazole are useful in a variety of situations in prophylaxis, empiric therapy, and treatment of probable/confirmed infection. Itraconazole exhibits a broad spectrum of activity against Aspergillus and Candida species. It has potential advantages over fluconazole (Diflucan), which does not exhibit in vitro activity against Aspergillus and most non-albicans Candida species, and amphotericin B, which is associated with a high incidence of toxicity. Aggressive use of itraconazole and amphotericin B preparations in treatment of fungal infection at Royal Free Hospital may have reduced mortality associated with aspergillosis. "
"Abstract: While there is little literature on the way in which people protected themselves against the sun, evidence from paintings suggest that clothing covering the body, veils and large brim hats were used by ancient Greeks, and that umbrellas existed in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, China and India. Veiel in 1887 (Vierteljahresschr. Derm. Syph. 14, 113-116) was able to protect a patient with eczema solare by the use of a tightly woven red veil. In 1889, Widmark (Uber den Einfluss des Lichtes auf die Haut. Hygiea, Festband #3, Samson and Wallin, Stockholm) used acidified quinine sulfate to absorb UVB, apparently because, since quinine fluoresces when irradiated with UVR, he rightly assumed that it would absorb the short wavelengths. In 1891, Hammer (Uber den Enfluss des Lichtes auf die Haut, Ferdinand Enke, Stuttgart) repeated Widmark's experiments and used quinine prepared in lotion or ointment as the first human sunscreen. Various plant extracts had been used at the turn of the century in folk medicine. One of the most effective was a chestnut extract from which aesculin was derived. Unna (Med. Klinik. 1911;7:454-456) developed several glycosides of aesculin,which were introduced as Zeozon and Ultrazeozon. In 1922, Eder and Freund (Wiener. Klin. Wchnschr. 35, 681-684) introduced 2-naphthol-6,8-disulfonic acid salts (Antilux) which were quite effective in both the UVB and UVA region. Over the next 40 years a number of different chemicals were introduced for sunscreen purposes: tannic acid (1925), benzyl salicylate (1931), para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives and 2-phenylimidazole derivatives (1942), anthranilic acid (1950), various cinnamates (1954), chloroquine (1962), benzophenones (1965) and many more since then. The list of chemical useful for sunscreen formulation is now extensive, the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Community have published compendia of approved chemicals and inorganic filters.

"Abstract: Exogenous administration of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is becoming widely used to enhance the endogenous synthesis of Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in photodynamic therapy. We analysed porphyrin formation in chemically induced squamous papillomas, after topical application of ALA and ALA hexyl ester (He-ALA) administered in different formulations, as well as the pattern of distribution in the internal organs, and the synthesis of porphyrins in distant tumoural and normal skins. A lotion formulation containing DMSO and ethanol was the best vehicle for topical ALA delivery to papillomas, whereas cream was the most efficient formulation for He-ALA application. Similar porphyrin concentration can be accumulated in the skin tumours employing either ALA or He-ALA delivered in their optimal formulations. The use of cream as a vehicle of both ALA and He-ALA, induces highest porphyrin tumour/normal skin ratios. The main advantage of using He-ALA is that porphyrins synthesized from the ester are more confined to the site of application, thus inducing low porphyrin levels in normal skin, liver, blood and spleen, as well as in papillomas distant from the point of application, independently on the vehicle employed, so reducing potential side effects of photodynamic therapy.

"BACKGROUND: We identified 19 patients with facial atopic eczema who failed to respond to tacrolimus (FK506) ointment, although tacrolimus ointment has shown excellent benefit for the treatment of recalcitrant facial erythema in most patients with atopic dermatitis. OBJECTIVES: We attempted to determine the efficacy of an original lotion formulation of tacrolimus for facial atopic dermatitis resistant to tacrolimus ointment. PATIENTS/METHODS: Recalcitrant facial erythema of these 19 patients was treated with an original tacrolimus lotion preparation for 6 months. Patch testing with white petrolatum was performed in both the 19 patients and in 30 other atopic dermatitis patients who had experienced excellent results with tacrolimus ointment. RESULTS: Of the 19 resistant patients, those whose symptoms were greatly or moderately improved by the lotion were 95%, 89% and 89% after 2 weeks, 3 months and 6 months of treatment, respectively. Further, patch testing to petrolatum showed positive reactions in several (six of 19) patients, compared with none of 30 controls with atopic eczema that had responded to topical tacrolimus ointment. CONCLUSIONS: The tacrolimus lotion had a significant effect on the recalcitrant facial erythema in adult patients with atopic dermatitis who were resistant to tacrolimus ointment. We suggest that one reason for the unresponsiveness to tacrolimus ointment may be because of contact sensitivity to white petrolatum. "
"Abstract: Helinx technology (Cerus Corp, Concord, CA) uses amotosalen HCl (S-59) and ultraviolet A (UVA) light in an ex vivo photochemical treatment (PCT) to inactivate viruses, bacteria, and leukocytes in platelet concentrates while preserving therapeutic function. A comprehensive preclinical safety program was conducted, which included carcinogenicity, single-dose and multiple-dose (up to 13 weeks' duration) toxicity, safety pharmacology (central nervous system [CNS], renal, and cardiovascular), reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, vein irritation, phototoxicity, and toxicokinetic testing. The results of the toxicokinetic analyses indicated that the test articles provided large multiples of the clinical exposure to S-59, whether the comparison was based on dose, maximum plasma concentration, or area under the concentration-time curve. No specific target organ toxicity, reproductive toxicity, or carcinogenicity was observed. S-59 and/or PCT formulations demonstrated CNS toxicity, electrocardiographic (ECG) effects, and phototoxicity at supraclinical doses. On the basis of the extremely large safety margins, the CNS and ECG observations (at >30,000-fold the expected clinical exposure) as well as the results of genotoxicity and phototoxicity studies are not considered to be of toxicological relevance. The results of an extensive series of studies have thus demonstrated no toxicologically relevant effects of platelets treated with Helinx technology. "
"UNLABELLED: Cyclosporin is a lipophilic cyclic polypeptide immunosuppressant that interferes with the activity of T cells chiefly via calcineurin inhibition. The original oil-based oral formulation of this drug (Sandimmun)l was characterised by high intra- and interpatient pharmacokinetic variability, with poor bioavailability in many patients; a novel microemulsion formulation (Neoral)1 was therefore developed to circumvent these problems. Studies show increases, attributable chiefly to improved absorption in patients who absorb the drug only poorly from the original formulation, in mean systemic exposure to cyclosporin with the microemulsion, with no clinically significant differences in tolerability or drug interaction profiles. Cyclosporin microemulsion is at least as effective as the oil-based formulation in renal, liver and heart transplant recipients, with trends towards decreased incidence of acute rejection with the microemulsion formulation in some (statistically significant in a few) trials. Cyclosporin microemulsion and tacrolimus appear to have similar efficacy in preventing acute rejection episodes in most renal, pancreas-kidney, liver and heart transplant recipients. However, there are indications of superior efficacy for tacrolimus in some trials, particularly in the prevention of severe acute rejection and in Black transplant recipients. Current 12-month data also indicate equivalent efficacy of sirolimus in renal transplantation. Conversion from the oil-based to microemulsion formulation in stable renal, liver and heart transplant recipients is achievable with no change in acute rejection rates. The addition of an anti-interleukin-2 receptor monoclonal antibody and/or mycophenolate mofetil to cyclosporin microemulsion plus corticosteroids decreases rates of acute rejection; corticosteroid withdrawal without increased acute rejection rates was also achieved on the addition of these agents in some trials. Pharmacoeconomic analyses have shown savings in direct healthcare costs in kidney or liver transplantation when cyclosporin microemulsion is used in preference to the oil-based formulation, although studies incorporating indirect costs or expressing costs in terms of therapeutic outcomes are currently unavailable. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of cyclosporin microemulsion has consolidated the place of the drug as a mainstay of therapy in all types of solid organ transplantation; research into optimisation of outcomes through more effective therapeutic monitoring in patients receiving this formulation is ongoing. Several novel immunosuppressants have been introduced in recent years: further clinical and pharmacoeconomic research will be needed to clarify the relative positioning of these agents, particularly with respect to specific patient groups. Other new drugs (basiliximab/daclizumab and mycophenolate mofetil) offer particular advantages when used in combination with cyclosporin. "
"Abstract: Psoriasis of the scalp is a frequently occurring condition affecting approximately 2% of the Western population. The sharply demarcated erythematosquamous lesions with silver-white scaling characterize scalp psoriasis. Quality of life can be seriously reduced by this condition and therefore long term treatment is needed in most patients. Coal tar shampoos, containing 2 to 10% coal tar solution, are effective in scalp psoriasis. However, no double-blind studies are available to support such an assumption. Salicylic acid 5 to 10% has a pronounced keratolytic effect. Salicylic acid should be formulated in an ointment, which can be washed off easily. Crude coal tar is the most effective tar available for the treatment of psoriasis. An important feature of coal tar is its potent efficacy against pruritus. At the scalp, the application of crude coal tar is difficult. Therefore coal tar solution is the most frequently applied tar preparation in scalp psoriasis. Dithranol 0.1 to 3% is manufactured in various formulations. Treatment is initiated at a low concentration and the concentration is increased stepwise until a slight irritation, the feeling of warmth, is reached. In the treatment of scalp psoriasis, cream formulations are used. Imidazole antifungals have been used with success in scalp psoriasis. Overgrowth of the scalp with pityrosporon is a well-known feature of scalp psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. In case of resistance to other topical treatments use of a topical or systemic imidazole derivative might be helpful. So far, topical corticosteroids are the most frequently used treatments for psoriasis of the scalp. Corticosteroids inhibit epidermal proliferation, inhibit inflammation and modulate immune functions. Topical corticosteroids are fast acting: within 3 to 4 weeks maximal efficacy is reached. No data are available to support the efficacy and safety of topical corticosteroids during long term use. However, from epidemiologic surveys we know that these treatments are used by the majority of patients for more than 8 weeks. Since 1992 vitamin D3 formulations have been developed for the treatment of psoriasis. Calcipotriol is available in most countries. Tacalcitol is available in Japan and several other countries. Vitamin D3 analogues inhibit epidermal proliferation, enhance cornification and inhibit inflammation. Therefore, vitamin D3 analogues have a substantial antipsoriatic effect. Systemic treatments such as methotrexate, cyclosporine and acitretin are indicated in patients with recalcitrant disease. Management of scalp psoriasis requires long term strategies in order to reach an optimal improvement of the condition, while avoiding the adverse effects associated with the long term use of treatments.

"BACKGROUND: Topical clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide have each demonstrated clinical efficacy in the treatment of acne vulgaris. When used in combination, they promise greater efficacy than either individual agent used alone and the combined use of benzoyl peroxide with topical antibacterial has been shown to decrease the emergence of antibacterial resistant species. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the efficacy and safety of a combination benzoyl peroxide plus clindamycin in a gel formulation compared with each of its 2 active constituents in gel vehicle, and gel vehicle given alone in the treatment of acne vulgaris. METHODS: In this 10-week, multicenter, double-blind trial, 480 patients with moderate to moderately severe acne were randomized to receive twice-daily treatment with 5% benzoyl peroxide plus 1% clindamycin, 5% benzoyl peroxide, 1% clindamycin, or vehicle. RESULTS: Significantly greater reductions in the number of inflammatory and total lesions were demonstrated in patients using combination therapy compared with those using any of its 3 individual components. Likewise, both physicians' and patients' global evaluations showed significantly greater improvements with the combination therapy than with its individual components. The most frequent adverse effect, dry skin, occurred to a similar extent in the combination and benzoyl peroxide treatment groups. CONCLUSION: The improved efficacy obtained with the combination therapy was accompanied by a tolerability profile similar to that of benzoyl peroxide alone, making this new combination product an alternative antimicrobial therapy for acne vulgaris. "
"Abstract: Topical sunscreen products are widely used for protection of the skin against the harmful effects of exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Sunscreen agents are incorporated into many everyday-use cosmetics as well as so called 'beach' products. An ideal sunscreen product will provide effective protection against UV radiation with minimal skin absorption of the active ingredients. There is now clear evidence that a common sunscreen chemical, benzophenone-3, is absorbed systemically following topical application to the skin. Other more lipophilic sunscreens are absorbed into the skin, but penetration to deeper tissues and the cutaneous circulation appears to be limited. However, the extent to which sunscreens that are absorbed into the stratum corneum are absorbed to deeper tissues and the systemic circulation over time is currently unknown. The formulation vehicle in which the sunscreen is presented to the skin has a significant effect on absorption into and through the skin. Alcohol-based formulations appear to increase sunscreen absorption. In addition, some sunscreen chemicals may enhance the skin absorption of other sunscreens when applied in combination. Clearly, further research into the influence of sunscreen and formulation properties on skin absorption could lead to optimal design of sunscreen products with respect to efficacy and minimizing absorption. Despite the extensive use of sunscreen products, there have been few reports of adverse effects, and these tend to be limited to acute dermatitis and allergies. Some recent reports have raised concerns that sunscreen chemicals may damage tissues, particularly in the presence of UV radiation. Further research into the toxicity of sunscreens is urgently required. Given the information currently available and the importance of protecting the skin against sun damage, there is no clear justification for restricting the use of sunscreen products at this time. "
"Abstract: A novel topical benzovl peroxide (BP) gelformulation containing liposomal BP was shown to significantly reduce local irritation relative to its nonliposomal BP gel (plain BP gel) preparation and also to improve clinical efficacy (almost twofold) in the treatment of acne. BP liposomes were prepared, optimized, and formulated into a carbopol 934gel base. Drug release evaluated using dialysis membrane has repeatedly shown that a new topical gel formulation containing liposomal BP (liposomal BP gel) significantly reduced BP penetration. Clinical evaluation data were also compared with those obtained with liposomal tretinoin (TRE) gel in an earlier investigation of ours. The overall improvement in terms of percentage reduction in total number of skin lesions demonstrated almost similar results for both BP and TRE. However, variation was observed in the treatment of separate types of lesions in which liposomal TRE gel was found to be more effective in treating comedones and liposomal BP gel in treating papules and pustules. Also, the liposomal gel formulation of both the drugs significantly reduced the local adverse effects, thereby improving patient compliance. "
"Abstract: Preclinical data indicate that trastuzumab (Herceptin) has the potential for synergistic or additive effects in combination with therapies including chemotherapy and hormonal agents, providing the rationale for a number of clinical trials in women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. A recently reported phase II trial has demonstrated that trastuzumab plus vinorelbine is both effective (overall response rate 75%) and well tolerated, with the major side effects being typical of single-agent vinorelbine. Other combinations of trastuzumab with a variety of other chemotherapeutic and hormonal agents are also being assessed. In an effort to overcome the cardiotoxicity observed with trastuzumab plus doxorubicin in the pivotal phase III trial, combination regimens involving potentially less toxic anthracyclines such as epirubicin and liposomal formulations of doxorubicin are ongoing. In addition, trials are investigating whether trastuzumab can reverse the resistance to hormonal therapy that develops in most women with metastatic breast cancer. These and other studies will identify the regimens that produce the best outcomes with the fewest possible side effects in women with HER2-positive breast cancer. "
"Abstract: The pediatric sedative combination of meperidine, promethazine, and chlorpromazine (MPC) has been widely used for more than 40 years. Despite its relatively poor efficacy and questionable safety profile, many emergency departments (EDs) continue to stock specially formulated mixtures of these three agents. We report a case of iatrogenic cardiac arrest in a 2-month-old infant in whom a consulting resident administered too much MPC (10 times the expected dose) by the wrong route (intravenous instead of intramuscular). The child was successfully resuscitated with no apparent neurologic deficit. Subsequently, we have removed MPC entirely from our ED and instituted a policy restricting ED procedural sedation privileges to emergency physicians. We urge other EDs to do likewise. "
"Abstract: Eosinophilic cellulitis (Wells'syndrome) is an uncommon skin disorder. We report two adult male patients who had recurrent erythematous plaques and a nodular lesion on the abdomen. The histopathologic feature of their skin biopsies similarly indicated a marked infiltrate of eosinophils in the dermis with the fashion of ""flame figures"". One of the patients demonstrated blood eosinophilia. Given the clinicohistological findings, the patients fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of eosinophilic cellulitis. The skin lesions remained refractory to medications such as corticosteroids, sulfones, antihistamines, and minocycline. Considering the beneficial effect of cyclosporine in the treatment of eosinophilia-associated dermatoses, we speculated that eosinophilic cellulitis might respond to cyclosporine therapy. Thus, each of the two patients was given cyclosporine (microemulsion formulation) at a daily dose of 1.25 or 2.5 mg/kg, i.e., 100 or 200 mg, respectively. Complete remission of the skin eruptions was obtained in both patients during a 3- or 4-week period of treatment. No side effects were observed. Neither of the patients experienced relapse of the disease at least over 10 months after the discontinuation of the cyclosporine therapy. We suggest that administration of low-dose cyclosporine be a safe and useful therapeutic option in patients with eosinophilic cellulitis. "
"Abstract: The immunomodulatory macrolactams provide an alternative to glucocorticosteroids for the topical treatment of atopic dermatitis and other inflammatory dermatoses. Tacrolimus (FK506), as well as the newer ascomycin derivative ASM 981 (pimecrolimus), penetrate the inflamed epidermis and are suitable for topical therapy. Both substances inhibit the transcription of proinflammatory cytokine genes such as interleukin 2, which are dependent on the nuclear factor NF-AT. They block the catalytic function of calcineurin, which leads to the inhibition of the transport of the cytoplasmic component of NF-AT to the cell nucleus. Multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trials with topical formulations have shown the efficacy of both substances in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. A review is presented of the biochemical and cell biologic properties, mode of action, pharmacokinetic data, side effects, results of the clinical trials, and further indications for tacrolimus and ASM 981, along with an overview of the related substances cyclosporine and sirolimus (rapamycin). "
"Abstract: It is now well documented that chronic UVA exposure induces damage to human skin. Therefore, modern sunscreens should not only provide protection from both UVB and UVA radiation but also maintain this protection during the entire period of exposure to the sun. UVA filters, however, are rare and not sufficiently photostable. We investigated the effect of the introduction of a new UV filter, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine (Tinosorb S), in oil in water sunscreen formulations on the photostability of butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone [AVB]) after irradiation with an optically filtered Xenon arc source (UV irradiance adjusted at 1 mean effective dose [MED]/min). With spectrophotometrical methods to assess the sun protection factor (SPF) and UVA ratio and chromatographical methods to determine the amount of UV filters recovered after irradiation we showed that Tinosorb S prevented the photodegradation of AVB in a concentration-dependent way, leading to a sustained SPF and UVA ratio even after irradiation with doses of up to 30 MED. Since AVB was shown to destabilize ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHM) we tested the effect of Tinosorb S in sunscreens containing this UV filter combination. Here too Tinosorb S showed photoprotective properties toward both UV filters. Thus, Tinosorb S can be used successfully to improve the photostability and efficiency of sunscreens containing AVB and EHM. "
"BACKGROUND: Fluticasone propionate is an established corticosteroid administered intranasally for the treatment of rhinitis or by oral inhalation for the treatment of asthma. Mometasone furoate, a closely related corticosteroid currently available in an intranasal formulation, is being investigated in an oral inhalation formulation for the treatment of asthma. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews available data on the comparative structure-activity relationships, chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and systemic bioavailability of fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate to assess whether claims of differences in the absolute systemic bioavailability of the 2 compounds are supported by the published literature. METHODS: Information for this review was identified through a MEDLINE search of the literature from 1966 to the present that contained the term mometasone or fluticasone. The resulting list was narrowed by excluding articles dealing with dermatologic applications. A systematic review was conducted of the identified literature pertaining to the molecular structure, topical potency, lipophilicity, pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability of the 2 agents. Additionally, the pharmacology of the 2 moieties was assessed by a review of the available literature on receptor binding affinity, transactivation and transrepression potency, and inhibition of inflammatory-cell cytokine expression. RESULTS: Based on the available data, fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate have similar physicochemical properties and structure-activity relationships. When administered intranasally, mometasone furoate is reported to have comparable relative systemic bioavailability to that of fluticasone propionate (mean plasma area under the curve, 123 pmol x h/L vs 112 pmol x h/L, respectively). When administered as a single dose by dry powder inhaler, orally inhaled fluticasone propionate is reported to have a total systemic bioavailability of approximately 17%, whereas that of mometasone furoate is reported to be < 1%. However, the mometasone furoate bioavailability study that reported the latter value used lower drug doses and a less sensitive assay than the fluticasone propionate bioavailability study. When multiple-dose data were used, mometasone furoate had an estimated 11% systemic bioavailability, similar to that of fluticasone propionate. CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate appear to have comparable potential systemic absorption and, based on the total systemic bioavailabilities of the parent compounds, have a low potential for systemic side effects at the recommended clinical doses. However, in the case of mometasone furoate, the contribution of the active metabolites to systemic effects has not been adequately assessed. "
"Abstract: Oral and externally used dermatological preparation for acne vulgaris employing herbal extracts have been developed and standardized, the herbal extracts used here were of the plants described in ayurvedic treatise like Bhavprakasha Nighantu and Charak Samhita. The efficacy of the treatment using the oral formulation with or without external preparation has been assessed through conduct of Phase II clinical trials in 53 patients for 4 weeks in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion and following Good Clinical Practices guidelines. The results were statistically analyzed and indicated that combination of use of internal and external preparation showed better efficacy as compared to the use of oral formulation alone. "
"Abstract: Dithranol is one of the mainstays in the topical treatment of psoriasis. However, the use of dithranol in psoriatic condition is inconvenient and troublesome, as it has irritating, burning, staining and necrotizing effect on the normal as well as the diseased skin. The entrapment of drug in vesicles is viewed to help in the localized delivery of the drug and an improved availability of the drug at the site will reduce the dose and in turn, the dose-dependent side effects like irritation and staining. The investigations deal with critical parameters controlling the formulation and stabilization of dithranol loaded liposomes and niosomes. The entrapment efficiency of dithranol in liposomes was optimized by altering the proportion of phosphatidyl choline and cholesterol, and in case of niosomes it was between Span 60 and cholesterol. Hydration and permeation mediums were also established keeping in view the poor solubility and stability of dithranol. The mean liposome and niosomes sizes were 4+/-1.25 and 5+/-1.5 microm, respectively. The drug-leakage study carried out at different temperatures of 4-8, 25+/-2 and 37 degrees C for a period of two months affirms that the drug leakage increased at a higher temperature. The in vitro permeation study using mouse abdominal skin shows significantly enhanced permeation with vesicles as indicated by flux of dithranol from liposomes (23.13 microg/cm(2)/h) and niosomes (7.78 microg/cm(2)/h) as compared with the cream base (4.10 microg/cm(2)/h).

"Abstract: A Japanese female patient with angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from her brother. Cyclosporine at a dose of 3 mg/kg was started by continuous infusion over 24 h on day -1 of BMT. Within a couple of minutes after the infusion was begun, she developed diffuse pruritic erythema on her whole body and tachycardia. The infusion was immediately stopped and corticosteroid was given, resulting in disappearance of the erythema gradually. She was then switched to intravenous tacrolimus. However, she suffered urticalial erythema again. Since polyoxyethylated castor oil, a solubilizer used in the injective formulation of both cyclosporine and tacrolimus, is considered to be responsible for the reaction, she was given oral capsules of cyclosporine (Sandimmun) in which polyoxyethylated castor oil was not contained. No further anaphylactic reaction was observed. The BM cells were successfully engrafted without causing severe GVHD. She was discharged on cyclosporine capsules without any further adverse effects. Anaphylaxis to intravenous cyclosporine and tacrolimus is a very rare but a serious complication. Our present case indicates that oral capsule of Sandimmun is a safe alternative to prevent GVHD in such a case of anaphylactic reaction against intravenous formulation. "
"Abstract: Corticosteroids are highly effective in inducing clinical remission in patients with active Crohn's disease. However, the role of corticosteroids in the treatment of this disease is primarily ameliorative because they are ineffective in maintaining remission or healing mucosal lesions. Nearly half of the patients who initially respond to corticosteroid therapy develop a dependency on corticosteroids or have a relapse within 1 year. In addition, use of these agents is often limited by a relatively high risk of serious adverse effects that can involve nearly every major body system. These effects include: bone loss, which can develop with even short-term and low-dose corticosteroid therapy; metabolic complications such as glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus; increased intraocular pressure and glaucoma; and potentially lethal infections. To minimize the risk of toxicity, corticosteroids are increasingly recommended for short-term use only at the lowest effective dose to induce remission in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. Corticosteroid formulations with low systemic bioavailability, such as controlled-release budesonide, may be associated with a lower rate of dermatologic adverse effects but appear to be somewhat less effective than conventional corticosteroids in inducing remission in patients with active Crohn's disease. Immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate have demonstrated corticosteroid-sparing effects, facilitating the withdrawal of corticosteroids when initiated as maintenance therapy. Infliximab can be used as an alternative to corticosteroids. "
"BACKGROUND: chemical peelings injure the superficial skin, which is then restored by healing of the wound. OBJECTIVES: to document the acute and chronic histological changes produced by applying chemical peeling agents used clinically to the UVB-irradiated skin of hairless mice, which served as a model of sun-damaged skin. DESIGN: three chemical peeling agents, 30% salicylic acid, dissolved in macrogol (a new formulation), 35% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) dissolved in distilled water and 20% glycolic acid dissolved in glycerin were applied to the backs of UVB-irradiated hairless mice. Untreated, irradiated areas of skin served as controls. Specimens were evaluated histologically at 3, 14, 28, and 70 days. RESULTS: chronic UVB irradiation produced an irregular hypertrophy of the epidermis. The treated areas of irradiated skin recovered by day 70. At 28 days, all skin specimens treated with chemical peeling agents exhibited a unique connective tissue layer composed of fine collagen fibers beneath the epidermis. While 35% TCA produced severe tissue damage marked by inflammation up to day 14, no inflammatory infiltrates were seen with 30% salicylic acid in macrogol at 70 days. CONCLUSIONS: chemical peeling with 30% salicylic acid dissolved in macrogol led to reorganization of the epidermis and a rebuilding of the superficial dermal connective tissue important in reducing wrinkles, and without evidence of inflammatory infiltrates in an animal model of sun-damaged skin. Findings suggest a possible clinical benefit. "
"Abstract: Alpha- and beta-hydroxy acids are compounds that have been used extensively in cosmetic and dermatological formulations. Clinical and qualitative effects of alpha- and beta-hydroxy acids have been well characterized, but little is known about their mechanism of action or acute and chronic biochemical effects. In the present study, we examined the acute proliferative effects of glycolic and salicylic acids on cell proliferation in the epidermis of SKH-1 female mice, using BrdU incorporation as a marker of epidermal proliferation. In preliminary experiments, we observed an increase in the rate of proliferation after 3 days of treatment with 10% glycolic acid-containing cream and this was sustained throughout a 6.5-week (treatment 5 days/week) time course compared with untreated control animals. After each treatment with cream containing glycolic acid there was a wave of proliferation that was maximal 12 to 16 h (significant at p < 0.05) after treatment, followed by a subsequent increase in epidermal thickness at 18 to 20 h (significant at p < 0.05). The effects of the concentration and pH level of glycolic acid- and salicylic acid-containing creams on the rate of proliferation and increases in skin thickness in SKH-1 epidermis were also investigated. We observed a dose-dependent increase in epidermal proliferation of animals treated with either glycolic or salicylic acid. A similar time-dependent response was observed in the epidermal thickness in animals treated with salicylic acid, but not with glycolic acid. Differences in pH (3.5 or 4.0) had no significant effect on either epidermal proliferation or skin thickness. The data that we present here should be useful in characterizing not only the beneficial but also the adverse effects that occur following acute or chronic usage of alpha-hydroxy acids. "
"Abstract: Two double-blind, randomized, split-face studies have been performed to compare the facial tolerability of topical retinoids in volunteers with sensitive skin. In one study, subjects applied tazarotene 0.1% gel to one side of their face and tretinoin 0.1% gel microsponge, tretinoin 0.025% gel, or adapalene 0.1% gel to the other side of their face, for up to 29 days. Increases in facial dryness and erythema were comparable among all retinoids. Some subjects in each treatment group experienced levels of retinoid-associated irritation that required temporary suspension of, or reduction in, treatment. Facial dryness and erythema tended to be greater in these subjects than in those who tolerated the regimen without change, suggesting that the need to discontinue or modify treatment depends more on the individual than on any major inherent differences in the irritant potential of these retinoids. A second study compared once-daily versus alternate-day tazarotene 0.1% gel therapy. Tolerability was superior when initiating therapy with the alternate-day regimen. "
"Abstract: Acute ethanol intoxication induces oxidative stress and apoptosis in primary cultured hepatocytes. Oxidative stress can trigger mitochondrial cytochrome c release initiating the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Based on this information, we formulated the hypothesis that ethanol induced oxidative stress causes mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in apoptosis. In the present study, we found that the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (MPT) is essential for induction of mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase activation of ethanol. The short-term incubation with ethanol (50 mmol/L) induced the MPT, cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and apoptosis of cultured rat hepatocytes. Hepatocyte apoptosis was prevented by caspase inhibitors (i.e., Z-VAD-fmk, DEVD-cho, and DMQD-cho). An MPT inhibitor, cyclosporin A, also prevented ethanol-induced cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and apoptosis, suggesting that acute ethanol-induced apoptosis is MPT dependent. Ethanol-induced MPT was also attenuated by N'N'-dimethylthiourea (DMTU, a scavenger of hydrogen peroxide, 10 mmol/L) and N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC, an antioxidant, 5 mmol/L). Preventing hepatocyte MPT by DMTU or NAC attenuated cytochrome c release as well as caspase activation, suggesting that ethanol-induced oxidative stress mediates the MPT. Thus, acute ethanol induces MPT via oxidative stress, and the MPT mediates mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in hepatocytes exposed to acute ethanol. "
"Abstract: Forty percent of patients with severe ulcerative colitis will fail to respond to intravenous corticosteroids. Cyclosporine and other calcineurin inhibitors offer an alternative to colectomy for these patients. Intravenous cyclosporine will induce remission within 14 days in 50-80% of patients who fail intravenous corticosteroids. The long-term response rates for responding patients are 40-60%. Subsequent maintenance therapy with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine is recommended at the present time, although the uncontrolled studies underlying this observation have yielded variable results. Toxicity occurs frequently in patients treated with high dose cyclosporine, and there is a small risk of opportunistic infection and death. Pilot studies have suggested that the microemulsion cyclosporine formulation Neoral and tacrolimus may also be of benefit in this patient population. Additional studies to determine the dose response of intravenous cyclosporine, to determine the role of azathioprine for maintenance, and to determine the efficacy of Neoral and tacrolimus are needed. "
"BACKGROUND: Isotretinoin is a very effective drug for treating severe recalcitrant nodular acne. A new micronized formulation of isotretinoin has been shown to be clinically equivalent to standard isotretinoin with improved bioavailability and minimal food effect. The safety profile of the micronized formulation has not been described previously. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to report the incidence and intensity of adverse events found in a comparative, double-blind efficacy study that showed clinical equivalence of the new micronized formulation of isotretinoin and the standard isotretinoin formulation (Accutane). METHODS: Six hundred patients with severe recalcitrant nodular acne were treated with micronized isotretinoin (n = 300) under fasted conditions or standard isotretinoin (n = 300) under fed conditions. One cohort received single daily doses of 0.4 mg/kg of micronized isotretinoin without food and the other cohort received 1.0 mg/kg per day of standard isotretinoin in two divided doses with food. Adverse events were monitored during 20 weeks of drug therapy. RESULTS: The proportion of adverse events in most body systems was generally lower in patients receiving micronized isotretinoin than in those receiving standard isotretinoin. CONCLUSION: Micronized isotretinoin appears to have a safety profile similar to that of standard isotretinoin and to carry a lower risk of mucocutaneous events and hypertriglyceridemia. "
"Abstract: Enteric coating of peppermint oil/caraway oil capsules avoids subjective discomfort to the patient caused by gastroesophageal reflux. In order to confirm bioequivalence of an enteric coated formulation containing peppermint oil and caraway oil (CAS 277309-55-4, Enteroplant) and an immediate release formulation of both oils, the pharmacokinetics of menthol and carvone after oral administration of the two formulations were studied in a randomized, two-period cross-over study in 16 healthy male volunteers. The subjects received 180 mg peppermint oil and 100 mg caraway oil, once as 2 enteric coated capsules of the fixed enteric coated combination preparation containing 90 mg peppermint oil (WS 1340) and 50 mg caraway oil (WS 1520) each (test) and once in the form of 5 capsules of an immediate release formulation (reference) containing 36 mg peppermint (WS 1340) oil and 20 mg caraway oil (WS 1520) each. The capsules were taken with 250 ml water after a 10 h fast. Both substances were determined in plasma by GC/MS after extraction. The limit of quantification was 10 ng/ml for menthol and 0.5 ng/ml for carvone. The mean maximum plasma levels for menthol were 1196 ng/ml after administration of the test medication and 1492 ng/ml after administration of the reference medication. The bioavailability with respect to the AUC was comparable after administration of test and reference preparation, the 90% confidence interval was 97 to 105%. As expected, there were considerable differences for Tmax. After application of the enteric coated form the maximum concentration was reached significantly later (3.0 h vs. 1.7 h) compared to the immediate release capsule. Corresponding data were also calculated for carvone. After application of the test medication the maxima of 14 ng/ml for both formulations were reached later (2.5 h vs. 1.3 h). The 90% confidence interval of the AUC for carvone was 79 to 119% and therefore slightly outside the acceptable range for bioequivalence of 80 to 125%. However, this fact should not be relevant, in particular since the dosage of the enteric coated capsule lies at the upper limit of the model text and positive clinical studies, also on the therapeutic equivalence of the two formulations, are available.

"AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of acitretin in a new topical formulation (mucoadhesive two-layer tablets) for the treatment of oral leucoplakias. METHODS: Twenty-one volunteers, 16 men, five women, with oral leucoplakia (histologically diagnosed), were included in this double-blind placebo-controlled study. Patients were randomized in three groups (A, B, C) of seven patients each. Groups A and B received tablets with different in vitro release profiles, and group C subjects (controls) received tablets without acitretin. The acitretin dose was 20 mg/day (two 10 mg tablets daily). Serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, cholesterol and triglycerides were evaluated before and after treatment. At the end of therapy the concentrations of acitretin in plasma, saliva and tissue were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: At the end of the study 71% (groups A and B) of patients showed clinical remission or marked improvement. No improvement was noted in the control subjects (group C). These results were further confirmed by histological findings. There were no significant changes in laboratory values in the three groups. The acitretin concentration in plasma and tissue ranged from 0 to 50 mg with no difference between groups A and B, and it was very high in saliva (ranging from 4.9 to 43 mg) with higher concentrations in group A than in group B (due to a longer adhesion time in group A). Patients' compliance was excellent. The results show that mucoadhesive tablets of topical acitretin are efficacious in the treatment of oral leucoplakia without systemic side-effects. "

"BACKGROUND: To assess the efficacy of oral microemulsion cyclosporine (CyA Neoral) in the treatment of steroid-refractory attacks of ulcerative an indeterminate colitis. METHODS: In this non-randomized study on the use of oral microemulsion cyclosporine in steroid refractory ulcerative colitis, we used CyA Neoral in 10 patients suffering from ulcerative colitis and in 1 patient suffering from indeterminate colitis with a steroid-refractory attack. The initial dose was 7-7.5 mg kg-1 day-1 adjusted to maintain whole blood cyclosporine levels between 250 and 350 ng/mL, as measured by RIA using monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: Nine patients presented a favourable response in a mean time of 3.6 days, that is, 81.8% of cases. One initial responder developed megacolon on the 11th day and another did not respond; surgical treatment was performed in both cases. The remaining nine patients, followed for a mean period of 14.6 months (2-36 months). Nine patients presented side effects, the most frequent being slight hand tremor with hypomagnesaemia, followed by hypertension, slight increase in creatinine and hirsutism. No one needed to withdraw from treatment, but the dose was lowered in three cases. CONCLUSIONS: Oral microemulsion cyclosporine is an effective drug in the initial management of patients suffering from a steroid-refractory attack of ulcerative and indeterminate colitis. Additional controlled studies with the new oral formulation are required to confirm these results. "
"Abstract: Modern sunscreen products provide broad-spectrum UV protection and may contain one or several UV filters. A modern UV filter should be heat and photostable, water resistant, nontoxic, and easy to formulate. Identification of a substance that meets these criteria is as difficult as discovering a new drug; hundreds of new molecules are synthesized and screened before a lead candidate is identified. The most important aspect in the development of a new UV filter is its safety. In our laboratories, the safety of new ultraviolet filters is assessed by an initial in vitro screen including photostability, cytotoxicity, photocytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and photogenotoxicity tests. These tests are performed in mammalian, yeast, and bacterial cell systems. Skin penetration potential is measured in vitro using human skin or, when required by regulations, in vivo. Because modern sunscreens are selected on the basis of their retention on and in the stratum corneum and are formulated as poorly penetrating emulsions, they generally have very low to negligible penetration rates. The safety and efficacy of UV filters are regulated and approved by national and international health authorities. Safety standards in the European Union, United States, or Japan stipulate that new filters pass a stringent toxicological safety evaluation prior to approval. The safety dossier of a new UV filter resembles that of a new drug and includes acute toxicity, irritation, sensitization, phototoxicity, photosensitization, subchronic and chronic toxicity, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, photogenotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and, in the United States, photocarcinogenicity testing. The margin of safety of new UV filters for application to humans is estimated by comparing the potential human systemic exposure with the no-effect level from in vivo toxicity studies. Only substances with a safe toxicological profile and a margin of safety of at least 100-fold are approved for human use. Finally, prior to marketing, new UV filters undergo stringent human testing to confirm their efficacy as well as the absence of irritation, sensitization, photoirritation, and photosensitization potential in man. UV filters not only protect against acute skin injury, such as sunburn, but also against long-term and chronic skin damage, including cellular DNA damage, photoinduced immune suppression, and, by extension, skin cancer. The protection provided by modern sunscreens against UV-induced skin cancer was shown in animal photocarcinogenicity studies and confirmed by numerous in vitro, animal, and human investigations: UV filters protect the p53 tumor suppressor gene from damage and prevent UV-induced immune suppression. Recent studies suggest that sunscreens protect against precursor lesions of skin cancer, such as actinic keratoses. Additional benefits of ultraviolet filters include prevention of photodermatoses, such as polymorphic light eruption, and, possibly, photoaging. Modern sunscreens are safe for children and adults. Percutaneous penetration and irritation rates of topically applied substances in children and adults are similar. The principal protective measure is to keep children out of the sun and/or to cover them with protective clothes; however, sunscreens are a safe and effective and often the only feasible defense of children against UV radiation. In conclusion, sunscreens are safe protective devices that undergo stringent safety and efficacy evaluation. "
"Abstract: Irinotecan (CPT-11) is a camptothecin analog with low (about 10--20%) and variable oral bioavailability in animal models. Here, Caco-2 cells were used to evaluate the transepithelial transport of CPT-11 and its metabolites. Caco-2 cells demonstrated significant expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated protein and canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter. Both the lactone and carboxylate forms of CPT-11 and SN-38 were actively transported across the cell monolayers, mainly by the apical-localized P-gp pump. Cellular permeability of CPT-11 at a concentration of 17 microM converted from active to passive-diffusional transport between the 2 and 6 h exposure time points. Antiproliferative effects of CPT-11 were related to permeability of the lactone form, whereas for SN-38 efficacy was dependent on lactone accumulation. Exposure of CPT-11 with cyclosporin A significantly enhanced its efficacy, whereas this was not observed with verapamil and R101933. In contrast, SN-38 efficacy decreased in the presence of P-gp inhibitors due to active transport toward the basolateral side, thereby reducing drug accumulation. Hence, multiple-active transport systems could be demonstrated to be responsible for not only accumulation profiles but also cytotoxic efficacy of CPT-11 and SN-38 in the intestinal Caco-2 cells. It is suggested that CPT-11 might act in a time-dependent manner and that SN-38-mediated cytotoxicity relates to (dose-dependent) lactone kinetics. The results detailed in this report could contribute toward the development of a clinically useful oral formulation of CPT-11 with improved absorption characteristics and suggest that cyclosporin A is a suitable agent for further research of this concept.

"Abstract: The non-ionic surfactants Cremophor EL (CrEL) and Tween 80, both used as formulation vehicles of many (anticancer) agents including paclitaxel and docetaxel, are not physiological inert compounds. We describe their biological properties, especially the toxic side effects, and their pharmacological properties, such as modulation of P-glycoprotein activity. In detail, we discuss their influence on the disposition of the solubilized drugs, with focus on CrEL and paclitaxel, and of concomitantly administered drugs. The ability of the surfactants to form micelles in aqueous solution as well as biological fluids (e.g. plasma) appears to be of great importance with respect to the pharmacokinetic behavior of the formulated drugs. Due to drug entrapment in the micelles, plasma concentrations and clearance of free drug change significant leading to alteration in pharmacodynamic characteristics. We conclude with some perspectives related to further investigation and development of alternative methods of administration. "
"Abstract: Soluble, uncrosslinked and high molecular weight copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone, VP, with 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, HEMA, prepared by free radical copolymerization, are proposed as supports for the modulated release of the immunosuppressor cyclosporine. Two copolymeric systems with copolymer compositions f(VP)=0.52 (namely VP--HEMA 60--40) and 0.42 (VP--HEMA 40--60) have been prepared and tested in vitro and in vivo using rats as animal model. Micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography, MEKC, has been used for the simultaneous detection of the polymer reabsorption and the drug release for the in vitro experiments. The composition and microstructural distribution of the copolymer system controls the solubilization rate which modulates the in vitro release of the drug (with time profiles from a few days to several weeks for the VP--HEMA 60--40 and 40--60, respectively) and the in vivo response that correlates with the previous in vitro results: the more hydrophobic implant (VP--HEMA 40--60) reverts the immune response more slowly (2--4 weeks) compared to the more hydrophilic one (VP--HEMA 60--40, 1--2 weeks).

"Abstract: Vitamin D analogues are widely used for the treatment of psoriasis. A new topical formulation of calcitriol (3 microg/g ointment) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of stable plaque-type psoriasis. This paper reports the results of four separate studies designed to evaluate specific local-safety parameters: cumulative irritancy, cutaneous contact sensitization, potential photoallergic contact sensitization and phototoxicity. Calcitriol 3 microg/g ointment was classified as non-irritant when compared to calcipotriol, tacalcitol and white petrolatum. Petrolatum and tacalcitol were slightly irritant and calcipotriol moderately irritant. No sensitization was observed with calcitriol 3 microg/g ointment. With regard to phototoxic potential, sites treated with calcitriol 3 microg/g ointment or vehicle ointment were less irritated than those treated with white petrolatum or those that were untreated. Using standard photoallergenicity testing methodology, there were no skin reactions of a photoallergic nature to the study material. These studies showed that calcitriol 3 microg/g ointment is a well-tolerated treatment for stable plaque-type psoriasis. "
"Abstract: Intrathecal chemotherapy with antineoplastic agents is mainly utilised in children with leukaemia and lymphoma, and in selected brain tumours. In these diseases, intrathecal use is restricted to methotrexate (MTX), cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and corticosteroids. A number of other agents are, at the present time, under evaluation. Intrathecal MTX administered sequentially with systemic high dose MTX infusion prolongs therapeutic cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) levels of the drug. Prolonged therapeutic CSF levels can also be achieved by giving repeated small intrathecal doses of MTX over an extended period in selected patients, with an implanted Ommaya reservoir. In the CSF, the metabolic inactivation of Ara-C is significantly lower than in plasma with a CSF clearance similar to the rate of CSF bulk flow. A slow-release formulation of Ara-C may be given intrathecally, resulting in a prolonged cytotoxic concentration in the CSF. CNS relapse and neurotoxicity in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, especially younger children, may be reduced by using age-related dosing of intrathecal MTX and Ara-C. Hydrocortisone is used in combination with MTX and Ara-C for so-called 'triple intrathecal chemotherapy' in the treatment of meningeal leukaemia. Intrathecal thiotepa does not appear to be advantageous over systemic administration in patients with brain and meningeal leukaemia. Monoclonal antibodies, reactive with tumour-associated antigens, can be used as delivery systems for chemotherapeutic agents and radionuclides. However, the development of this new approach is currently under evaluation in larger clinical studies. Neurological adverse effects may be expected with intrathecal chemotherapy and are increased by high dose systemic therapy, concomitant cranial radiotherapy or meningeal infiltration by neoplastic cells. Inadvertant intrathecal administration of antineoplastic agents that are indicated for systemic administration only, is dangerous and may result in a fatal outcome. "
"CONTEXT: A zinc preparation that provides a higher concentration of solubilized zinc in a minimally irritating formulation allowing controlled absorption would be of great clinical value for treating oral herpes. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of zinc oxide/glycine cream as a treatment for facial and circumoral herpes infection by measuring duration and intensity of signs and symptoms and assessing adverse effects. DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Subjects were enrolled from the general community through advertisements. PATIENTS: Forty-six subjects with facial or circumoral herpes infections. INTERVENTION: Application of a zinc oxide/glycine cream or a placebo cream every 2 hours until cold sore resolved or 21 days elapsed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Duration of cold sore lesions, severity of signs and symptoms, and frequency of adverse effects. RESULTS: Subjects who began treatment with a zinc oxide/glycine cream within 24 hours of onset of signs and symptoms experienced a significantly shorter duration of cold sore lesions (mean, 5.0 days) than did subjects treated with a placebo cream (mean, 6.5 days). Subjects treated with the zinc oxide/glycine cream also experienced reduction in overall severity of signs and symptoms, particularly blistering, soreness, itching, and tingling. Side effects among subjects treated with zinc oxide/glycine cream were those expected from an ionic zinc salt solution. All were completely reversible and of short duration. CONCLUSION: Zinc oxide/glycine cream is an effective treatment for facial and circumoral herpes infection with predictable adverse effects that are completely reversible. "
"BACKGROUND: Mometasone furoate (MF; Schering-Plough, Madison, NJ), is a glucocorticoid with high local potency and low potential systemic availability. OBJECTIVES: To compare the relative efficacy and safety of a new formulation of MF, coupled with a recently designed dry powder inhaler (DPI), in the treatment of patients with moderate persistent asthma. Fluticasone propionate administered by Diskhaler (FP Diskhaler, 250 microg twice a day; Glaxo Wellcome, Research Triangle Park, NC) was used as an active control. DESIGN: A randomized, parallel group, double-blind (for MF-DPI dosage), evaluator-blind (for MF-DPI vs FP) trial. SETTING: Sixty centers in 20 countries. PATIENTS: Seven hundred thirty-three patients with moderate persistent asthma on inhaled corticosteroid treatment. INTERVENTIONS: Discontinuation of previous inhaled corticosteroid and initiation of one of four study treatments: three doses of MF-DPI (100, 200, and 400 microg twice daily) and one of FP (250 microg twice daily >12 weeks). RESULTS: FEV1 (primary efficacy variable) was evaluated as the mean change from baseline to endpoint (last evaluable visit). All dosage groups showed improvement at endpoint. Only 400 microg twice daily of MF-DPI (+0.19 L) was statistically different from 100 microg twice daily of MF-DPI (+0.07 L; P = 0.02). MF-DPI (200 microg twice daily) and FP Diskhaler groups showed similar improvement (+0.16 L). Greater improvement in most secondary variables (forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of vital capacity, and morning and evening peak expiratory flows) also resulted from treatment with 200 or 400 microg twice daily of MF-DPI or with FP Diskhaler, compared with 100 microg twice daily of MF-DPI. Overall, a total daily 800-microg dose of MF-DPI conferred no significant additional benefit >400 microg of MF-DPI. The incidence of oral candidiasis was 1%, 7%, 10%, and 10% in the 100, 200, and 400 microg twice daily of MF-DPI and FP groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A total daily dose of 400 microg of MF-DPI provides clinical benefit comparable to that observed with a total daily dose of 500 microg of FP Diskhaler. "
"UNLABELLED: Parenteral lipids are susceptible to light-induced peroxidation, particularly under phototherapy. Ascorbic acid is protective. The aim of this study was to investigate whether dark delivery tubing and/or coadministration of multivitamin preparations could prevent peroxidation of Intralipid without undue vitamin loss. In experiments carried out on the benchtop, lipid peroxidation occurred in ambient light and was more extensive under phototherapy. Dark tubing decreased peroxide formation, but only by about 65%. In simulated clinical conditions in which solutions were pumped through standard clear or dark minibore plastic tubing. Intralipid accumulated lipid peroxides as measured by the FOX assay (280 microM) or as triglyceride hydroperoxides (52 microM). Multivitamin preparations (MVIP or Soluvit/Vitlipid) inhibited peroxide formation almost completely, and were fully protective when used with dark tubing. There was loss of riboflavin (65% from Soluvit and 35% from MVIP) in clear tubing but this was decreased to 18% and 11%, respectively, in dark tubing. Ascorbate loss was 20% (MVIP) and 50% (Soluvit) and only slightly less in dark tubing. Ascorbate loss was also seen in the absence of Intralipid and is due to riboflavin-induced photo-oxidation. CONCLUSION: Multivitamin preparations protect Intralipid against light-induced formation of lipid hydroperoxides, and administering multivitamins with Intralipid via dark delivery tubing provides a practical way of preventing peroxidation of the lipid while limiting vitamin loss. This procedure should be considered for routine use as well as with phototherapy. "
"Abstract: Pre-clinical studies indicate that cisplatin encapsulated in STEALTH((R))liposomes (SPI-77) retains anti-tumour activity, but has a much reduced toxicity, compared to native cisplatin. A phase I study was conducted to determine the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of SPI-77 administered to children with advanced cancer not amenable to other treatment. Paediatric patients were treated at doses ranging from 40 to 320 mg m(-2)by intravenous infusion every 4 weeks. Blood samples taken during, and up to 3 weeks after, administration and plasma and ultrafiltrate were prepared immediately. Urine was collected, when possible, for 3 days after administration. SPI-77 administration was well tolerated with the major toxicity being an infusion reaction which responded to modification of the initial infusion rate of SPI-77. Limited haematological toxicity and no nephrotoxicity were observed. No responses to treatment were seen during the course of this phase I study. Measurement of total plasma platinum showed that cisplatin was retained in the circulation with a half life of up to 134 h, with maximum plasma concentrations approximately 100-fold higher than those reported following comparable doses of cisplatin. Comparison of plasma and whole blood indicated that cisplatin was retained in the liposomes and there was no free platinum measurable in the ultrafiltrate. Urine recovery was less than 4% of the dose administered over 72 h. Results from this phase I study indicate that high doses of liposomal cisplatin can safely be given to patients, but further studies are required to address the issue of reformulation of liposomally bound cisplatin.

"Abstract: Clinical applications of the first-generation multidrug resistance (MDR) modulators, such as cyclosporin A (CsA) have been hampered because of their severe side effects in vivo. In this study, we utilized liposomes and Intralipid to provide selective delivery of CsA to tumor cells as well as to circumvent toxicities associated with CsA by altering the pharmacodistribution properties of encapsulated CsA. The MDR reversing effect of CsA in free, liposomal or Intralipid formulations on the uptake and transport of epirubicin in Caco-2 cells and rat intestines was evaluated. The results showed that CsA in free or liposomal formulations significantly enhanced the intracellular accumulation of epirubicin in a dose-related fashion in Caco-2 cells, with the highest enhancement at 2 microM: These formulations substantially ameliorated the apical to basolateral absorption of epirubicin in Caco-2 cells and markedly increased mucosal to serosal absorption of epirubicin in rat jejunum and ileum. CsA in free, liposomal or Intralipid formulations all significantly reduced basolateral to apical efflux of epirubicin across Caco-2 monolayers. CsA encapsulated in liposomes showed greater enhancement than other formulations. In conclusion, liposomal preparations of CsA may circumvent MDR and have the advantage of diminishing side effects, thus providing a useful alternative dosage form for intravenous administration of CsA to be combined with cytotoxic agents for the treatment of resistant tumors.

"BACKGROUND: Cyclosporine is effective in psoriasis, but long-term continuous therapy may be limited by renal impairment and hypertension. Intermittent short courses of treatment should minimize side effects and improve the risk-benefit ratio. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of intermittent short courses of the microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine (Neoral) in the management of chronic plaque psoriasis unresponsive to topical therapies. METHODS: In a multicenter open cohort study, 76 subjects were treated intermittently over a 2-year period. Patients with chronic plaque psoriasis were treated with cyclosporine until clearance of psoriasis or for a maximum of 12 weeks. Patients were then randomized into two groups. Group A stopped cyclosporine abruptly, whereas group B had the dose reduced by 1 mg/kg per day each week until cessation, which was within 4 weeks. On relapsing, patients received further courses of cyclosporine. Intermittent treatment was continued in this way for 2 years. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the percentage of time in remission during the 2-year period between patients randomized to stop cyclosporine abruptly (56.2%) and patients randomized to taper cyclosporine within 4 weeks (61.8%). The mean percentage of time that patients received treatment during the study was 40.5% for randomization group A, 46.2% for randomization group B, and 42.8% overall. The median time to relapse was 115.5 days after the first treatment course but became progressively shorter after multiple treatment courses. Mean blood pressure and serum creatinine levels did not show any clinically significant changes over time. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that intermittent short courses of cyclosporine are effective in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis for up to 2 years while improving the safety profile relative to continuous cyclosporine monotherapy. "
"Abstract: The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus form the cornerstones of most immunosuppression protocols. Because of their variable pharmacokinetics, and their narrow therapeutic indices, post-transplant immunosuppressive drug monitoring is an essential part of patient care to minimize the risks of toxicity or acute rejection. Furthermore, a reduction in the rate of acute rejection has been shown to result in a lower rate of graft loss due to chronic rejection. The introduction of the microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine with its more consistent bioavailability has renewed interest in the use of alternative sampling strategies to the trough cyclosporine concentration. Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations support the concept that determination of cyclosporine during the absorption phase (0-4 h) might offer a better prediction of cyclosporine immunosuppressive efficacy. Initial investigations suggest that monitoring a 2-h postdose concentration C(2) may provide a more efficacious alternative to trough monitoring for optimizing therapy with Neoral. Tacrolimus has a 10- to 100-fold greater in vitro immunosuppressive activity compared with cyclosporine. Consistent with its greater potency, therapeutic whole blood trough concentrations for tacrolimus are around 20-fold lower than the corresponding cyclosporine concentrations. The correlation between toxicity and tacrolimus trough concentrations appears to be stronger than that for acute rejection. The results from a concentration-ranging trial in primary kidney-transplantation and liver-transplantation trials all found a significant relationship between toxicity and tacrolimus trough levels. Azathioprine is converted in vivo to 6-mercaptopurine, which is subsequently metabolized to the pharmacologically active 6-thioguanine nucleotides. The latter are also responsible for the cytotoxic side effects. Reliance on blood counts to monitor azathioprine therapy can be misleading, and they do not provide information on immunosuppresive efficacy. More pertinent information can be obtained through the measurement of thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity and the quantification of intracellular 6-thioguanine nucleotides concentrations in red blood cells. Prospective studies have demonstrated the clinical utility of determining 6-thioguanine nucleotides to individualise immunosuppressive therapy with azathioprine not only in the field of transplantation, but also in inflammatory bowel disease.

"Abstract: The aim was to study the ursodeoxycholic acid (UDC) effect on the cyclosporin A (CsA) pharmacokinetics after oral administration of the microemulsion formulation Neoral (CsA-ME) in liver transplant recipients, and test the potential protective effect of this bile acid on liver and renal CsA-ME-induced toxicity. At entry into the study, 12 patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation received CsA-ME, for at least 6 months. They then received a cotreatment CsA-ME plus UDC (13.8 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) for three months. Blood concentrations of CsA were measured using a monoclonal antibody specific for the parent compound. The kinetic data were analysed by a mathematical model incorporating a time dependent rate coefficient for CsA intestinal absorption, before and after UDC treatment. Changes in serum markers of hepatic and renal injury were assessed. Individual serum bile acids were determined by chromatography. Serum levels of UDC increased from 3 to about 45% of total serum bile acids after UDC treatment. The estimated model parameters indicate that UDC administration modulates CsA intestinal absorption. In the nine non-cholestatic patients, UDC reduced the absorption rate and the bioavailability of CsA without modifying the elimination rate constant of CsA and the CsA pre-drug levels. In contrast, in the three cholestatic patients, the bioavailability tended to be higher and the absorption rate faster when CsA was combined with UDC. UDC significantly decreased elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase and creatinine serum levels and induced some clinical improvements such as disappearance of headaches in four patients. In conclusion, a 3-month UDC treatment modifies CsA intestinal absorption without affecting CsA elimination rate constant. On the other hand, UDC supplementation appears to improve CsA tolerability. "
"PURPOSE: Oral bioavailability of docetaxel is very low, which is, at least in part, due to its affinity for the intestinal drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp). In addition, metabolism of docetaxel by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 in gut and liver may also contribute. The purpose of this study was to enhance the systemic exposure to oral docetaxel on coadministration of cyclosporine (CsA), an efficacious inhibitor of P-gp and substrate for CYP 3A4. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A proof-of-concept study was carried out in 14 patients with solid tumors. Patients received one course of oral docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) with or without a single oral dose of CsA 15 mg/kg. CsA preceded oral docetaxel by 30 minutes. During subsequent courses, patients received intravenous (IV) docetaxel 100 mg/m(2). RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in patients who received oral docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) without CsA was 0.37 +/- 0.33 mg.h/L and 2.71 +/- 1.81 mg.h/L for the same oral docetaxel dose with CsA. The mean AUC of IV docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) was 4.41 +/- 2.10 mg.h/L. The absolute bioavailability of oral docetaxel was 8% +/- 6% without and 90% +/- 44% with CsA. The oral combination of docetaxel and CsA was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Coadministration of oral CsA strongly enhanced the oral bioavailability of docetaxel. Interpatient variability in the systemic exposure after oral drug administration was of the same order as after IV administration. These data are promising and form the basis for the further development of a clinically useful oral formulation of docetaxel. "
"BACKGROUND: Conventional oral PUVA therapy is hampered by large inter- and intraindividual variations in the bioavailability of 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP), caused by its low solubility in the gastrointestinal juices and large interindividual differences in hepatic metabolism rate (hepatic first pass). AIMS: New galenic formulations of 8-MOP based on solid dispersions, suspensions, and saturated solutions containing penetration enhancers were developed for sublingual administration, a drug delivery route which avoids the hepatic first pass metabolism. METHODS: Solubility properties of 8-MOP were tested in 22 potential penetration enhancers and solubilizers. Following preliminary in vivo tests of 13 sublingual 8-MOP formulations, five were administered to groups of volunteers at a nominal dose of 0.6 mg/kg body weight: two solid dispersions based on PEG 1540 (with and without Xylitol); a solution in Labrasol (glyceryl and PEG-8 caprylate/caprate), PEG 400, Transcutol (ethoxydiglycol) (1:1:1); a micronized suspension in sorbitol, water, ethanol, propylene glycol (ca. 3:1:1:5 w/v); and Oxsoralen capsules. Pharmacokinetic behaviour of 8-MOP was examined in serum; samples were analysed by HPLC. Photosensitivity was measured in seven subjects. RESULTS: The peak of maximum 8-MOP concentration in blood was sharp, rapid and reproducible: tmax of 8-MOP in blood averaged 23+/-3 min, independent of the particular formulation. Cmax was higher when 8-MOP was presented in dissolved form (solution and capsule formulations, 85+/-29 and 85+/-35 ng/ml, respectively) and lowest with the suspension (42+/-15 ng/ml). Photosensitivity peaked reproducibly at 45 min. post dosing. CONCLUSIONS: Sublingual PUVA therapy is suitable for patients with skin types I and II, in particular patients who are less suitable candidates for standard PUVA therapy (due to hepatic, renal, or cardiac insufficiency) or who have experienced side effects with standard PUVA. "
"BACKGROUND: Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a serious complication of transplantation caused by immunosuppressive drugs. In this study, we assessed the incidence of PTDM and the factors that are associated with the development of this complication. METHODS: The study population included 2078 non-DM renal allograft recipients, transplanted since 1983 in one institution. PTDM was diagnosed by the requirement of hypoglycemic medications, starting more than 30 days after transplantation. Post-transplant, all patients received cyclosporine (CsA) and prednisone, but none of these patients received tacrolimus. RESULTS: At 1, 3, 5, and 10 years after transplantation, 7, 10, 13, and 21% of patients developed PTDM. By multivariate Cox, the following variables correlated with a more rapid increase in the number of PTDM cases: (1) older age (RR = 2.2 comparing patients younger or older than 45 years, P < 0.0001), (2) transplant done after 1995 (RR = 1.7, P = 0.003), (3) African American race (RR = 1.6, P = 0.003), and (4) higher body weight at transplant (RR = 1.4, P < 0.0001). Compared with before 1995, since 1995, the percentage of patients with PTDM has increased from 5.9 to 10.5% at one year and from 8.8 to 16.9% at three years. This increase was statistically independent from all other variables tested. However, since 1995, recipients have become significantly heavier (P < 0.0001) and older (P < 0.0001), and the average CsA level has increased significantly (P < 0.0001). Also, since 1995, the cumulative dose of corticosteroids has declined (P < 0.0001); patients received a newer, better absorbed preparation of CsA and received mycophenolate mofetil. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of PTDM increases continuously with time post-transplant. There has been an increase in the incidence of PTDM in patients transplanted recently, and that increase can be explained only partially by changes in the recipients' characteristics. We postulate that this increase may be due to the introduction of better absorbed CsA formulations that result in higher blood levels and higher cumulative exposure to this diabetogenic drug. "
"Abstract: Exorex is a new topical formulation for the treatment of psoriasis; it contains 1% coal tar and a synthetic analogue resembling components identified in banana skin (a complex of esterified essential fatty acids). To determine whether the esterified essential fatty acid complex confers any therapeutic advantage over coal tar alone, patients with chronic plaque psoriasis (n = 20) were entered into a double-blind, randomized, right/left comparison of Exorex, and Exorex without the essential fatty acid component (known hereafter as coal tar control) for 8 weeks. Target plaques were scored (0-4) for erythema, desquamation and infiltration at day 0 and at 2 week intervals throughout the study. No significant differences were detected between Exorex and coal tar control with respect to changes in the summed scores at baseline and following 8 weeks of treatment (mean difference in summed score changes from baseline between Exorex and coal tar control 0.2, 95% confidence interval - 0.44 to 0.84; P = 0.52) or in the area under the response-time curve (P = 0.16). Mean percentage improvement in summed scores of target plaques were 53.9% (SE = 4%) and 56.1% (SE = 4.9%) for Exorex and coal tar control, respectively. Results suggest that the complex of esterified essential fatty acids is not exerting any clinically important therapeutic effect in the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. "
"OBJECTIVE: The pharmacokinetic profile of a single dose of inhaled fluticasone propionate (FP) administered via a metered-dose inhaler (MDI), containing either a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) or hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellant was investigated in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Two randomised, double-blind, crossover studies were conducted, each in 12 male volunteers. Both studies compared pharmacokinetic data after a single inhaled dose of FP 1000 microg from a MDI containing either CFC (CFC MDI) or HFA (HFA MDI) with a single intravenous dose of FP 250 microg. RESULTS: The maximum plasma FP concentrations after inhalation via the 2 types of MDI were almost identical (0.56 and 0.54 microg/L for CFC MDI and HFA MDI, respectively); bioavailability values of inhaled FP from the 2 MDIs were also similar (geometric mean values: 26.4% via the CFC MDI and 28.6% via the HFA MDI). Inhalation of FP via both MDI formulations produced similar reductions in urinary cortisol excretion over 12 and 24 hours postdose. CONCLUSION: The bioavailability values of FP after inhalation via a CFC MDI and an HFA MDI are similar. The 2 formulations deliver comparable amounts of FP, and systemic exposures to FP from the 2 devices, measured by urinary cortisol excretion, are not significantly different. "
"Abstract: A novel intravenous liposomal formulation of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) was evaluated in 69 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL): 32 new diagnoses, 35 relapses, and 2 oral ATRA failures. Liposomal ATRA (90 mg/m(2)) was administered every other day until complete remission (CR) or a maximum of 56 days. Treatment following CR was liposomal ATRA with or without chemotherapy. In an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of all patients, CR rates were 62%, 70%, and 20% in newly diagnosed, group 1 first relapses (ATRA naive or off oral ATRA more than or equal to 1 year), or group 2 relapses (second or subsequent relapse or first relapses off oral ATRA less than 1 year), respectively. In 56 evaluable patients (receiving 4 or more doses), CR rates for the same groups were 87% (20 of 23), 78% (14 of 18), and 23% (3 of 13). Remission failure in newly diagnosed patients was not from resistant disease. Several patients in CR became polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative for promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor-alpha (PML/RARalpha) after liposomal ATRA alone. Toxicity was generally mild, most commonly headaches (67. 5%). Eighteen patients (26%) had ATRA syndrome develop during induction. One-year survival of ITT patients was 62%, 56%, and 20% for newly diagnosed, group 1, and group 2, respectively. The medium duration of CR has not yet been reached and was 18 and 5.5 months in the same groups. These results demonstrate that liposomal ATRA is effective in inducing CR in newly diagnosed or group 1 APL patients. It provides a reliable dosage of ATRA for patients with APL unable to swallow or absorb medications and can induce molecular remissions without chemotherapy. "
"BACKGROUND: Flovent Diskus is a powder formulation of the inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone propionate (FP) delivered via a breath-actuated, multidose inhaler. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of dry powder FP administered once or twice daily (200 microg per day) to children with persistent asthma. METHODS: Twelve-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial with a 52-week, open-label extension. Children aged 4 to 11 were required to have pulmonary function 50% to 85% of predicted values. The population was stratified for baseline therapy (inhaled corticosteroid/cromolyn or bronchodilators only). After a 2-week placebo run-in, 242 patients received dry powder FP 200 microg each morning, dry powder FP 100 microg BID, or placebo for 12 weeks; 192 were rerandomized to the QD or BID regimen for an additional 52 weeks of open-label treatment. Primary endpoints were mean changes in FEV1 and morning PEF recorded at clinic visits. RESULTS: Both dry powder FP regimens significantly improved FEV1, evening PEF, and asthma symptoms at the double-blind phase endpoint (P < or = .017 compared with placebo). The BID regimen also significantly improved morning PEF and nighttime awakenings due to asthma (P < or = .005). Among patients previously treated with inhaled corticosteroids/cromolyn, improvements observed with the QD and BID regimens were similar. Patients switched from BID to open-label QD treatment showed additional improvements at week 52 generally comparable to patients who received the BID regimen during both phases. Fluticasone propionate was well tolerated for up to 64 weeks with few reports of drug-related adverse events or morning plasma cortisol abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Once daily dosing of dry powder FP 200 microg is an effective and convenient alternative for children whose asthma is controlled with a more frequent dosing regimen of inhaled corticosteroids. "
"Abstract: Severe asthmatics treated with oral/inhaled corticosteroids are at risk of side effects (adrenal suppression). Oral cyclosporin A has been effective in asthma treatment, and nebulized cyclosporin A has been administered for approximately 6 months with no nephrotoxicity or hepatotoxicity, suggesting a wider therapeutic margin for an inhaled cyclosporin A for treatment of asthma. Single- and repeated-dose studies in healthy and asthmatic male and female subjects were conducted to determine the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of a new formulation of inhaled cyclosporin A (ADI628) metered-dose inhaler (MDI). ADI628 had roughly dose-linear increases in blood concentrations with moderate variability after single and multiple administration in healthy subjects. Steady-state ADI628 concentrations reflected an effective half-life of 7.0 to 12.5 hours. No overt gender-related differences were observed after single inhaled 10 mg ADI628 dose. However, asthmatics and females (20 mg dose group) had lower ADI628 concentrations as compared to healthy males, probably due to lower inspiratory flow rates and probably not due to disease- or gender-related differences in metabolism/elimination of ADI628. Renal excretion was a minor route of elimination for ADI628 with no dose- or gender-related differences. The blood ADI628 exposure in humans was 1/3- to 1/6-fold lower than the no-effect dose in dogs. Also, the blood ADI628 exposure after the highest inhaled dose was much lower than after the administration of the efficacious oral cyclosporin A dose (3 mg/kg) for treating asthma. The highest steady-state dose (10 mg bid) resulted in ADI628 concentrations that are not typically associated with systemic nephrotoxicity or immunosuppression. Furthermore, repeated inhaled doses of ADI628 were safe and generally well tolerated with no apparent systemic immunosuppressive activity in healthy and asthmatic subjects. "

"Abstract: Increasing consumer awareness as to the hazards of UV light should fuel ongoing interest in self-tanning products. As a result of the benign toxicologic profile of DHA, products containing DHA represent a safe alternative to UV-induced tanning. The results obtained with these products depend on the final formulation, the individual application technique, and the consumer's complexion type. Greater experience in formulation combined with increasing sophistication on the part of the consumer should lead to continuing growth in interest and satisfaction with the use of DHA-containing sunless or self-tanning products. Individuals need to be informed that these products do not offer significant protection against UV-B. If formulated with standard sunscreens, consumers should be cautioned that the duration of UV protection is more short-lived than the color change. "
"Abstract: Effective treatment of acne vulgaris can prevent emotional and physical scarring. Therapy varies according to the severity of the disease. Topical medication is generally adequate in clearing comedonal acne, while inflammatory acne usually requires the addition of oral medication. Systemic antibiotics are used most frequently and can be highly effective. Newer formulations of combined oral contraceptives are also helpful in modulating sebum production in the female patient. Severe nodulocystic acne that does not respond to topical retinoids and systemic antibiotics may be treated with isotretinoin. However, the side effect profile of this medication is extensive, and physicians should be well-versed in its potential adverse effects. "
"PURPOSE: To compare the ocular comfort of two ophthalmic anti-allergic agents: olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% and ketotifen fumarate 0.05%. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a double-masked, multi-centered, randomized trial, 80 subjects were asked to make a 'forced choice' based on ocular comfort between one drop of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% instilled in one eye and one drop of ketotifen fumarate 0.05% instilled in the contralateral eye. At one site, the incidence of adverse reactions was also reported. RESULTS: All subjects (100%) selected olopatadine as the more comfortable formulation. One site (n = 35) reported a 49% incidence of moderate burning and a 49% incidence of mild burning after ketotifen instillation. One subject (2% of population) at this site experienced no ocular discomfort with ketotifen. There were no reports of discomfort associated with olopatadine instillation. CONCLUSION: Olopatadine is a more comfortable ophthalmic preparation than ketotifen. "
"Abstract: Retinoids have shown promising activity for both cancer chemoprevention and as a treatment for emphysema. However, chronic oral administration of these drugs is limited by systemic side effects, including hepatic dysfunction, skeletal malformations, hyperlipidemia. hypercalcemia, and other reactions. In order to improve the pulmonary targeting of this potentially useful therapy, we developed a system for aerosolization of retinoids that substantially increased their local bioavailability. We compared the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of an inhaled formulation of all-trans-retinoic acid (all-trans-RA), which was packaged in a metered dose inhaler, following both intratracheal (IT) and intravenous (IV) administration in male Sprague-Dawley rats. After drug administration, anesthetized animals were killed at 5 min, and at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 h. Plasma and emulsified samples of liver and lung tissues were dissected, extracted, and frozen prior to measurement of all-trans-RA concentration by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Aerosolization and IT injection of all-trans-RA resulted in a significantly longer pulmonary half-life of the drug (both 5-17 h), lower peak serum concentrations (aerosol 71 +/- 31 ng/ml, IT 68 +/- 50 ng/ml), and lower liver levels (aerosol 111 +/- 28 ng/g, IT 753 +/- 350 ng/g) than the same dose administered IV (2 h, 838 +/- 56 ng/ml, 4,258 +/- 1,006 ng/g, respectively; P < 0.05 for each comparison). Histologic examination of lungs and trachea showed no focal irritation attributable to the drug after single-dose administration. These results suggest that aerosolization of retinoids may offer a practical alternative to systemic oral administration for chemoprevention trials or treatment of lung diseases. This method may substantially increase the therapeutic index of these compounds by reducing systemic complications associated with long-term dosing. "
"BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the tolerance of preservative free sterile cleanser and sterile moisturizer in irritated and sensitive face skin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An exploratory, open-label study using the cleanser and the moisturizer in combination was performed with 98 patients with a documented history of allergic contact dermatitis. The 2 products could each be used once or twice daily for 28 days. The assessment parameters at baseline and end of treatment (day 28) included the intensity of erythema, dryness/scaling by the investigator and subjective signs (burning, pruritus and stinging), according to a defined 4-point scale (absent to severe). In addition, a global assessment of the change from baseline and the overall tolerance of the products were performed by the investigator at the end of treatment. RESULTS: Ninety-four patients were included for the efficacy analysis and 96 patients for the safety analysis. At baseline, a majority of patients expressed some degree of erythema (63%), and dryness/scaling (56%). Fewer patients experienced subjective signs at baseline (44%). At the end of treatment, the results showed a statistically significant improvement of all the objective signs of irritated skin (P = .0001, Mac Nemar test), as well as the subjective signs of sensitive skin (P < 0.02). This was confirmed by the overall investigator assessment, showing an excellent or good response in 90% of the patients. In the safety analysis, 1 patient developed contact allergy to 1 ingredient of the test products (carbomer), and 3 patients exacerbated their dermatitis. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results suggest that adequately formulated cosmetics might reduce both irritated and sensitive skin, with clinical improvement of dryness, erythema and stinging. "
"Abstract: Oral paclitaxel is not inherently bioavailable because of the overexpression of P-glycoprotein by intestinal cells and the significant first-pass extraction by cytochrome P450-dependent processes. This study sought to simulate the toxicological and pharmacological profile of a clinically relevant schedule of paclitaxel administered on clinically relevant i.v. dosing schedules in patients with advanced solid malignancies using oral paclitaxel administered with cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of both P-glycoprotein and P450 CYP3A. Nine patients were treated with a single course of oral paclitaxel in its parenteral formulation at a paclitaxel dose level of 180, 360, or 540 mg. Cyclosporin A was administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg p.o. 1 h before and concurrently with oral paclitaxel. Blood sampling was performed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel, 6-alpha-hydroxypaclitaxel, 3-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, and cyclosporin A. The pharmacokinetic behavior of paclitaxel was characterized using both compartmental and noncompartmental methods. Model-estimated parameters were used to simulate paclitaxel concentrations after once daily and twice daily oral administration of paclitaxel and cyclosporin A. Aside from an unpleasant taste, the oral regimen was well tolerated, and there were no grade 3 or 4 drug-related toxicities. The systemic exposure to paclitaxel, as assessed by maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) values, did not increase as the dose of paclitaxel was increased from 180 to 540 mg, and there was substantial interindividual variability (4-6-fold) at each dose level. Mean paclitaxel Cmax values approached plasma concentrations achieved with clinically relevant parenteral dose schedules, averaging 268+/-164 ng/ml. AUC values averaged 3306+/-1977 ng x h/ ml, which was significantly lower than AUC values achieved with clinically relevant i.v. paclitaxel dose schedules. However, computer simulations using pharmacokinetic parameters derived from the present study demonstrated that pharmacodynamically relevant steady-state plasma paclitaxel concentrations of at least 0.06 microM would be achieved after protracted once daily and twice daily dosing with oral paclitaxel and cyclosporin A. Paclitaxel metabolites were detectable in three patients, and the 6-alpha-hydroxypaclitaxel: paclitaxel and 3-p-hydroxypaclitaxel:paclitaxel AUC ratios averaged 0.63 and 0.86, respectively; these values were substantially higher than values reported in patients treated with i.v. paclitaxel. Oral paclitaxel was bioavailable in humans when administered in combination with oral cyclosporin A 5 mg/kg 1 h before and concurrently with paclitaxel treatment, and plasma paclitaxel concentrations achieved with this schedule were biologically relevant and approached concentrations attained with clinically relevant parenteral dose schedules. However, treatment of patients with oral paclitaxel using a single oral dose administration schedule failed to achieve sufficiently high systemic drug exposure and pharmacodynamic effects. In contrast, computer simulations demonstrated that clinically relevant pharmacodynamic effects are likely to be achieved with multiple once daily and twice daily oral paclitaxel-cyclosporin A dosing schedules.

"BACKGROUND: Chronic eosinophilic rhinosinusitis underlies a range of respiratory disorders including nasal polyposis. Surgical and medical methods are used to control polyps, with topical steroids commonly being used for their anti-inflammatory properties. Fluticasone propionate nasal drops (FPND) is a formulation developed specifically for an effective and well tolerated corticosteroid treatment of nasal polyposis. OBJECTIVES: To assess efficacy and tolerability of FPND in the treatment of bilateral nasal polyposis in adults. METHODS: This multicentre, randomized, parallel-group study compared FPND 400 microgram once daily (o.d.) with placebo for 12 weeks in adult patients with mild to moderate bilateral polyposis. The primary efficacy endpoint was visual assessment of polyp size by the physician at monthly clinic visits. Nasal blockage, rhinitis, peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF), olfactory function and requirement for polypectomy were also assessed at visits. The patients kept diary card records of symptoms, PNIF, and use of rescue antihistamine. Additional safety data were provided by a 12-week open extension, when all patients received FPND 400 microgram o.d. RESULTS: After 12 weeks double-blind treatment with FPND (n = 52) or placebo (n = 52), polyp size was reduced in 27% and 16% of patients, respectively; clinical reduction of nasal blockage significantly favoured FPND over placebo (55% vs 22%; P = 0.002), and clinic PNIF had increased significantly with FPND (by 52 L/min vs -3 L/min for placebo; P < 0.001). Diary card measurements showed significant benefits of FPND vs placebo for daily PNIF, nasal blockage, rhinitis and use of loratadine rescue medication. Both treatments were well tolerated and no serious adverse events occurred during randomized treatment. Epistaxis was more frequent with FPND than placebo but was generally mild and did not result in withdrawals. Mean serum cortisol levels did not change significantly with either treatment. CONCLUSION: This study showed FPND 400 microgram o.d. to be an effective and well tolerated treatment for bilateral nasal polyposis in adults. "
"Abstract: For the past decade, the use of oral and intravenous cyclosporine has been examined for patients with inflammatory bowel disease who have demonstrated resistance to steroid treatment. Updated and new results from a number of studies offer short-term and long-term data on cyclosporine and its effectiveness in achieving and maintaining remission from disease. Short-term and long-term toxicity associated with cyclosporine is reviewed here, as well as quality of life among patients who have been treated successfully. Also discussed are practice patterns among clinicians using cyclosporine in its varied formulations and the appropriate settings for its use. "
"Abstract: Repeated oral administration of chemopreventive retinoids such as isotretinoin over extended periods of time is associated with intolerable systemic toxicity. Here isotretinoin was formulated as a powder aerosol, and its delivery to the lungs of rats was studied with the aim to explore the possibility of minimizing adverse effects associated with its oral administration. Rats received isotretinoin orally (0.5, 1 or 10 mg kg(-1)) or by inhalation (theoretical dose approximately 1 or approximately 10 mg kg(-1)) in a nose-only inhalation chamber. Isotretinoin was quantitated by high-pressure liquid chromatography in plasma and lung tissue. The ratios of mean area of concentration-vs-time curve (AUC) values in the lungs over mean AUCs in the plasma for isotretinoin following single or repeated aerosol exposure surpassed those determined for the oral route by factors of between two (single low-dose) and five (single high-dose). Similarly, the equivalent ratios for the maximal peak concentrations in lungs and plasma obtained after aerosol exposure consistently exceeded those seen after oral administration, suggesting that lungs were exposed to higher isotretinoin concentrations after aerosol inhalation than after oral administration of similar doses. Repeated high doses of isotretinoin by inhalation resulted in moderate loss of body weight, but microscopic investigation of ten tissues including lung and oesophagus did not detect any significant aerosol-induced damage. The results suggest that administration of isotretinoin via powder aerosol inhalation is probably superior to its application via the oral route in terms of achieving efficacious drug concentrations in the lungs.

"Abstract: Tretinoin gel microsphere, 0.1%, is a highly effective anti-acne medication formulated with sponge-like microspheres encapsulating the active ingredient, tretinoin. In addition to minimizing cutaneous irritation, this system may also reduce facial shine. This single-center, double-blind, half-face study evaluated the potential of tretinoin gel microsphere, 0.1%, to reduce the appearance of facial shine compared to tretinoin cream, 0.025%. Thirty-five subjects (ages 12 to 24 years) with moderate acne vulgaris and moderate facial oiliness, were evaluated after 4 consecutive days of product use. On sides treated with tretinoin gel microsphere, 0.1%, investigators found significantly reduced facial shine at 3 and 6 hours posttreatment. Subjects' self-evaluations revealed a significant reduction in facial shine at 3 hours posttreatment. Photographic analyses showed reductions in facial shine for both treatments, but decreases were greater on tretinoin gel microsphere, 0.1%-treated sides. Both therapies were well tolerated, and no adverse events occurred. Tretinoin gel microsphere, 0.1%, has the added benefit of reducing the appearance of facial shine, which is a frequent concern in acne patients. "
"Abstract: The poor selectivity of photosensitizers for tumor tissue remains a drawback in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and could be improved by adapted formulations. The cellular uptake, localization and phototoxicity of meta-tetra(hydroxyphenyl)chlorin (mTHPC) encapsulated in submicronic colloidal carriers have been studied in macrophage-like J774 cells and HT 29 human adenocarcinoma cells. Nanocapsules with an external layer made of poly(D,L lactic acid) (PLA NCs), PLA grafted with polyethylene glycol (PLA-PEG NCs), PLA coated with poloxamer 188 (polox PLA NCs) and oil/water nanoemulsion (NE) have been examined. The cellular uptake by J774, as determined by microspectroflorimetry, is reduced with mTHPC encapsulated into surface-modified NCs--PLA-PEG and polox PLA--compared with naked PLA, indicating a possible limitation of the clearance of such carriers by the reticuloendothelial system. Encapsulation also modifies the interaction between mTHPC and HT29 cells. Compared with the manufacturer's solution (PEG, ethanol, water), the cellular uptake is strongly reduced. However, the HT29 phototoxicity is much less affected and a protecting effect against plasma proteins is observed. Fluorescence microscopy reveals a specific punctate fluorescence pattern with PLA-PEG and polox PLA NCs in contrast to a more diffuse distribution with NE and solution, indicating that photodamage targeting could be different. These findings suggest that photosensitizers encapsulated into surface-modified nanocapsules could be a promising approach for improving PDT efficacy and this has to be confirmed in vivo. "
"Abstract: In the search for the ideal dithranol cream preparation for short-contact treatment of psoriasis, we investigated the clinical efficacy, side effects and patient appreciation of two dithranol cream preparations (cream A and B) in a double-blind left-right comparing study. Dithranol was dissolved at preparation in cream A and dispersed in cream B. Cream A is known to have a shelf life of 1 year, while cream B has a much shorter shelf life (several months). Ten patients with chronic plaque-type psoriasis were treated during 7 weeks in a short-contact regimen. The clinical efficacy was monitored by scoring of erythema, induration, scaling and involved area (PASI); skin irritation was scored visually, and patient appreciation was evaluated by means of a multiple-choice questionnaire. Dispersion of dithranol in a cream was associated with less irritation and less discoloration of the skin, and its efficacy was comparable with that of the cream in which the dithranol was dissolved. As the dispersed dithranol formulation is easier to be manufactured, its quality will be less depending on the pharmacist's experience and equipment, and so more reliable. Besides, it will be less expensive to prepare. We advise to use this formulation for short-contact treatment. "
"Abstract: Mitomycin C (MMC) is a clinically useful anticancer drug which can cause severe dermatological problems upon injection. It can cause delayed erythema and/or ulceration occurring either at or distant from the injection site for weeks or even months after administration. In an attempt to reduce the skin necrosis, complexation of MMC with cyclodextrins was studied in order to help increase patient compliance and acceptance. The complexation of MMC with 2-Hydroxypropylbetacyclodextrin (HPBCD) in the presence and absence of mannitol was studied and it was found that the mannitol present in the commercial formulation caused an increase in the binding of MMC to HPBCD. Isotonicity adjustment of hypotonic MMC formulations by the addition of normal saline did not change the degree of complexation with MMC. The complexed formulations were then tested to determine their antitumor efficacy using the B-16 melanoma cell model. No difference in antitumor activity between the complexed and uncomplexed MMC formulations was observed. Different MMC formulations were tested for their potential to produce skin irritation and/or toxicity using intradermal injections in a BALB/c mouse model in order to find the most suitable formulation. The skin ulceration studies indicated that there were no significant differences between the isotonic MMC solution and isotonic formulations of MMC complexed with HPBCD. "
"Abstract: This study compared the efficacy and safety of the fluticasone propionate 125 microg pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) propelled by either hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) 134a or chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propellants, in adult patients with asthma. HFA 134a is a non-ozone depleting propellant used as a replacement for the CFC propellants 11 and 12 which are being phased out in accordance with the Montreal Protocol. Three hundred and eighty patients with mild to moderate asthma and 'room for improvement' in their treatment were randomized to receive fluticasone propionate 250 microg twice daily via pMDIs propelled by either CFC propellants 11 and 12 (n = 195) or HFA 134a (n = 185). Fluticasone propionate significantly improved lung function over the 4-week treatment period in both treatment groups. The improvement in mean morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) after 7 days of treatment was approximately 12 l min(-1) in both groups, rising to approximately 22 l min(-1) at the end of the 4-week treatment period. The adjusted mean difference between the two formulations over weeks 1-4 was -1 l min(-1) (90% confidence interval: -7, 5 l min(-1)), confirming their equivalence. Clinical comparability was also demonstrated with respect to secondary efficacy variables, including daily symptom scores, evening PEF and clinic visit expiratory measurements. There were no clinically relevant differences in adverse events or serum cortisol levels between the two groups. The fluticasone propionate 125 microg HFA 134a pMDI is an effective and well tolerated product and is a suitable replacement for the fluticasone propionate 125 microg CFC pMDI at a microgram equivalent dose.

"Abstract: Sunscreens prevent sunburn and may also prevent skin cancer by protecting from ultraviolet-induced DNA damage. We assessed the ability of two sunscreens, with different spectral profiles, to inhibit DNA photodamage in human epidermis in situ. One formulation contained the established ultraviolet B filter octyl methoxycinnamate, whereas the other contained terephthalylidene dicamphor sulfonic acid, a new ultraviolet A filter. Both formulations had sun protection factors of 4 when assessed with solar simulating radiation in volunteers of skin type I/II. We tested the hypothesis that sun protection factors would indicate the level of protection against DNA photodamage. Thus, we exposed sunscreen-treated sites to four times the minimal erythema dose of solar simulating radiation, whereas vehicle and control sites were exposed to one minimal erythema dose. We used monoclonal antibodies against thymine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts and image analysis to quantify DNA damage in skin sections. A dose of four times the minimal erythema dose, with either sunscreen, resulted in comparable levels of thymine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts to one minimal erythema dose +/- vehicle, providing evidence that the DNA protection factor is comparable to the sun protection factor. The lack of difference between the sunscreens indicates similar action spectra for erythema and DNA photodamage and that erythema is a clinical surrogate for DNA photodamage that may lead to skin cancer.

"Abstract: The absolute bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of three formulations of ondansetron hydrochloride 24 mg--an oral tablet, an intravenous solution, and an extemporaneous rectal suppository--were studied. Twelve healthy, nonsmoking volunteers (six men and six women) were given ondansetron in a study with a three-way cross-over design. All subjects received each dosage form on the same day in the following order: oral tablet, rectal suppository, and intravenous infusion. Administrations were separated by one week. Blood sampling times varied, depending on the administration route. Mean absolute bioavailability for the oral tablet and the rectal suppository differed significantly. Absorption of ondansetron was prolonged when it was administered as the rectal suppository. Absolute bioavailability for the 24-mg tablet was similar to that for other tablet strengths in previous studies. All subjects completed the study without significant adverse effects. Absorption of ondansetron from the rectal suppository was prolonged compared with the oral tablet and the i.v. infusion. Bioavailability for the 24-mg suppository formulation was considerably lower than for the 24-mg tablet. "
"Abstract: 1. One of the major challenges in the development of pharmaceuticals is their formulation with other materials to give them the desired bioavailability profile when administered into the body. 2. We have developed a flexible platform technology (Tris lipidation) to simply and effectively alter the lipophilicity of drugs. As implied by the name, the technology uses the common buffer Tris as a linker between the drugs of interest and a domain of variable hydrophobicity. 3. We demonstrate, using a mouse melanoma model, that Tris-lipidated conjugates of the widely used cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory drug methotrexate (MTX) display enhanced potency in the local treatment of tumours and reduced systemic toxicity when compared with the unconjugated drug. 4. With genes now being predicted to be the pharmaceuticals of the future, we show that Tris-lipidated cationic peptides can efficiently deliver DNA into (transfect) cells in culture. Furthermore, by comparing the abilities of variants of these Tris-based cationic lipids to transfect cultured cells, we demonstrate that modifications made to variable regions of Tris-lipidated compounds can dramatically alter their delivery profiles.

"Abstract: CyA is the core immunosuppressant of choice for the majority of transplant patients. The introduction of Neoral, a new microemulsion formulation of CyA. and more recently a range of adjunctive immunosuppressants have further enhanced the efficacy and tolerability of CyA-based immunosuppression. In the first year following transplantation the major causes of morbidity and death are graft failure, acute rejection, and systemic infection. Patients with deteriorated pulmonary circulation before transplantation are at increased risk of early postoperative death. Risk factors for early acute rejection include female donor sex, young donor age, and multiple HLA-DR mismatches. The principal cause of death in the long term is graft vasculopathy which accounted for 40% of all deaths. Risk factors that have been hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of graft vasculopathy include hyperlipidemia, recipient age and gender, donor age, the number of HLA AB and DR mismatches, and CMV infection. Strategies proposed to reduce the risk of graft vasculopathy include aggressive use of lipid-lowering agents, avoidance of low CyA doses, and the use of adjunctive rapamycin or RAD therapy. Rejection surveillance therefore relies on routine serial endomyocardial biopsy. Recent research suggests that a more accurate assessment of the state of the graft can be obtained by considering the results across a number of biopsy samples obtained from different parts of the heart, rather than basing clinical judgment on the worst single result obtained. New molecular markers such as granzyme A mRNA are likely to improve the power of histology to diagnose and predict rejection. Neoral pharmacokinetics give greater bioavailability and less intrapatient variability than Sandimmune. In the keynote OLN 351 study comparing Neoral with Sandimmune in de novo heart transplant recipients, fewer Neoral patients needed antilymphocyte therapy to treat rejection, fewer female patients had rejection episodes in the Neoral group, the tolerability of the two formulations was equivalent, and there was a lower incidence of infections in the Neoral group. The clinical impact of Neoral in comparison with Sandimmune in de novo heart transplant patients has been investigated in a number of additional trials, including long-term studies, which have confirmed that Neoral is associated with: Lower CyA doses than Sandimmune. Equal or greater antirejection efficacy than Sandimmune. Comparable tolerability to Sandimmune. During the administration of intravenous CyA as an induction therapy in the days immediately following transplantation, there is evidence to suggest that a 6-hour infusion given twice daily, which mimics the pharmacokinetic profile of oral dosing, may be clinically more effective than a continuous 24-hour infusion. Milligram-for-milligram dose conversion from Sandimmune to Neoral is feasible. Following conversion, a reduction in the CyA dose may be required in the majority of patients to maintain target levels. In pediatric patients, the rate of elimination of CyA is greater and bioavailability increases with increasing age. Younger patients (less than 8 years of age) may be managed more effectively with a 3-times-daily, rather than a twice-daily dosing schedule. A number of studies have compared the clinical effects of Sandimmune and Neoral in maintenance therapy for cardiac transplant patients. As with de novo patients, these studies have found the new formulation of CyA to be associated with lower rates of acute rejection, lower therapeutic doses, and comparable tolerability. Milligram-to-milligram conversion from the old to the new CyA formulation is generally well tolerated, although in a minority of patients there is a significant increase in CyA levels. These may be associated with a transient increase in side effects which resolve on dose reduction. There is a dose-sparing effect with Neoral. Routine monitoring of both CyA and serum creatinine levels are adv "
"Abstract: This review and critical analysis of current trends of immunosuppression management in pediatric transplantation provides evidence and support for the continued role of Neoral as an indispensable part of immunosuppressive protocols. CyA formulation influences clinical outcomes such as acute rejection, as confirmed by two studies. The CyA microemulsion formulation provides more reliable and effective absorption. An advanced TDM strategy to determine CyA bioavailability can improve the effectiveness and safety of immunosuppression in de novo liver transplant patients. especially in the younger de novo patient. Neoral is an indispensable part of combination protocols in pediatric transplantation. "
"Abstract: Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is a gram negative pleiomorphic rod that is the causative agent of a severe, highly infectious and often fatal pleuropneumonia in swine. We have previously reported the construction of genetically-defined stable riboflavin auxotrophs by replacement of a portion of the APP riboflavin biosynthetic operon (ribGBAH) with an antibiotic cassette encoding resistance to kanamycin, and have demonstrated that such riboflavin auxotrophs are avirulent. In this study, we evaluated riboflavin auxotrophs of A. pleuropneumoniae for their ability to stimulate protective immunity against pleuropneumonia. An initial challenge experiment demonstrated that intramuscular vaccination with a live attenuated serotype 1A rib mutant, in a vaccine formulation that included a limiting amount of exogenous riboflavin, provided better protection against challenge with virulent A. pleuropneumoniae than either intratracheal immunization or intramuscular immunization with live bacteria in the absence of exogenous riboflavin. Subsequent studies in which the vaccine inoculating dose, concentration of exogenous riboflavin, and serotype of the vaccine strain were varied demonstrated that immunization with live avirulent riboflavin auxotrophs could elicit significant protection against experimental challenge with both homologous and heterologous virulent serotypes of A. pleuropneumoniae.

"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy, safety, formulation tolerability, and optimal dosing of a novel cyclosporin A oil-in-water emulsion formulation for the treatment of moderate-to-severe dry eye disease. DESIGN: Randomized, multicenter, double-masked, parallel-group, dose-response controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Total enrollment: 162 patients; cyclosporin A groups: 129 patients; vehicle group: 33 patients. INTERVENTION: Patients instilled study medication (cyclosporin A ophthalmic emulsion 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, or 0.4%, or vehicle) twice daily into both eyes for 12 weeks, followed by a 4-week posttreatment observation period. EFFICACY: rose bengal staining, superficial punctate keratitis, Schirmer tear test, symptoms of ocular discomfort, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI; a measure of symptom frequency and impact on vision-related functioning). SAFETY: biomicroscopy, cyclosporin A blood levels, conjunctival microbiology, intraocular pressure, visual acuity, and monitoring of adverse events. RESULTS: In a subset of 90 patients with moderate-to-severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca, the most significant improvements with cyclosporin A treatment were in rose bengal staining, superficial punctate keratitis, sandy or gritty feeling, dryness, and itching, with improvements persisting into the posttreatment period in some treatment groups. There was also a decrease in OSDI scores, indicating a decrease in the effect of ocular symptoms on patients' daily lives. There was no clear dose-response relationship, but cyclosporin A 0.1% produced the most consistent improvement in objective and subjective end points and cyclosporin A 0.05% gave the most consistent improvement in patient symptoms. The vehicle also performed well, perhaps because of its long residence time on the ocular surface. There were no significant adverse effects, no microbial overgrowth, and no increased risk of ocular infection in any treatment group. The highest cyclosporin A blood concentration detected was 0.16 ng/ml. All treatments were well tolerated by patients. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclosporin A ophthalmic emulsions, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.4%, were safe and well tolerated, significantly improved the ocular signs and symptoms of moderate-to-severe dry eye disease, and decreased the effect of the disease on vision-related functioning. Cyclosporin A 0.05% and 0.1% were deemed the most appropriate formulations for future clinical studies because no additional benefits were observed with the higher concentrations. "
"BACKGROUND/AIMS: A new dosage formulation consisting of an anti-cancer drug bound to activated carbon particles was developed for a local injection against early gastric cancer so that the dosage formulation yields chemotherapeutic effects selectively to the lymph node metastases as well as to the primary lesion. METHODOLOGY: As a pilot study, the new dosage formulation, total of 50-200 mg of methotrexate only or total of 200 mg of methotrexate plus 8 mg of mitomycin C, was injected into the primary lesions and the adjacent gastric wall of 8 patients with early gastric cancer, guided by a gastrofiberscope before gastrectomy. The surgically resected specimens were examined histologically for the therapeutic effects on the primary lesion and its nodal metastasis. RESULTS: The therapeutic effects were seen in 2 of 4 lymph node metastases (50%) and 5 of 8 of the primary lesions (63%), as confirmed histologically with degeneration and/or necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative local injection of the new dosage formulation will be useful to give chemotherapeutic effects on the potential metastases in the regional nodes as well as to the primary lesion.

"Abstract: In the treatment of psoriasis with topical vitamin D3 analogues, lesional and perilesional irritation is the main side-effect. The aim of this study was to investigate whether local side-effects generated by tacalcitol, a vitamin D3 analogue, show concentration dependence. 3 different concentrations of tacalcitol (0.4; 4; 40 microg/g ointment) and the vehicle were applied on normal skin of the back of 25 healthy volunteers under occlusive conditions for 5 days. Assessment of erythema, infiltration and scaling as well as measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was performed on days 1 to 5. On day 5, additional skin barrier tests (DMSO test, alkali resistance test) were performed. Erythema and slight infiltration, but no scaling, were observed in a number of subjects without significant differences. TEWL also did not show significant differences for the test formulations, though there was a tendency towards lower values in the untreated areas. In the skin barrier tests, a tendency towards higher alkali resistance in the test areas treated with 40 microg tacalcitol/g ointment was detected. Thus, under occlusive conditions, the irritant potential of tacalcitol is very low. There is no convincing evidence of concentration dependence in irritation generated by tacalcitol when applied under occlusive conditions. "
"OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of cyclosporin A ([CsA] 0.05% and 0.1% ophthalmic emulsions) to vehicle in patients with moderate to severe dry eye disease. DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, 6-month, vehicle-controlled. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 877 patients with defined moderate to severe dry eye disease (292 to 293 in each treatment group). METHODS: Two identical clinical trials; patients were treated twice daily with either CsA, 0.05% or 0.1%, or vehicle. The results of these two trials were combined for analysis. EFFICACY: corneal and interpalpebral dye staining, Schirmer tear test (with and without anesthesia), tear break-up time, Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), facial expression, patient subjective rating scale, symptoms of dry eye, investigator's evaluation of global response to treatment, treatment success, and daily use of artificial tears. SAFETY: occurrence of adverse events, best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, biomicroscopy, and blood trough CsA concentrations. RESULTS: Treatment with CsA, 0.05% or 0.1%, gave significantly (P < or = 0.05) greater improvements than vehicle in two objective signs of dry eye disease (corneal staining and categorized Schirmer values). CsA 0.05% treatment also gave significantly greater improvements (P < 0.05) in three subjective measures of dry eye disease (blurred vision, need for concomitant artificial tears, and the physician's evaluation of global response to treatment). There was no dose-response effect. Both CsA treatments exhibited an excellent safety profile, and there were no significant topical or systemic adverse safety findings. CONCLUSIONS: The novel ophthalmic formulations CsA 0.05% and 0.1% were safe and effective in the treatment of moderate to severe dry eye disease yielding improvements in both objective and subjective measures. Topical CsA represents a new pharmacologically based treatment for dry eye disease that may provide significant patient benefits. "
"Abstract: This review covers the new immunosuppressive drugs that have appeared in the past 5 years. It begins with the newest formulation (Neoral, Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ, USA) of the clinically ""mature"" drug cyclosporin A and then reviews the literature on tacrolimus, sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. In each case, the emphasis is on the evolution of experience with the drug and on the questions that the drug poses for pediatricians considering the risk-benefit ratio of the drug in children. "
"Abstract: Verteporfin, a benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid ring A, is a photosensitising drug for photodynamic therapy (PDT) activated by low-intensity, nonheat-generating light of 689nm wavelength. Activation generates cytotoxic oxygen free radicals. The specificity and uptake of verteporfin for target cells with a high expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, such as tumour and neovascular endothelial cells, is enhanced by the use of a liposomal formulation and its rapid uptake by plasma LDL. Verteporfin therapy (at light doses < 150 J/cm) selectively damages neovascular endothelial cells leading to thrombus formation and specific occlusion of choroidal neovascular vessels in subfoveal lesions in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Repeated applications of verteporfin therapy 6 mg/m2 improved or maintained visual acuity in the majority of patients with some classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) secondary to AMD at 1 year's follow-up in 2 large multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials. Furthermore. in a subgroup of these patients with predominantly classic CNV secondary to AMD, there was a significantly more marked visual acuity (VA) benefit with 67.3% of verteporfin-treated eyes experiencing less than a 15-letter loss of VA versus 39.3% with placebo treatment. Multiple applications of verteporfin therapy were well tolerated in patients with subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD. The most common adverse events were visual disturbances, injection site reactions, photosensitivity reactions and infusion-related back pain. "
"Abstract: We have previously shown that skin reconstructed in vitro is a useful model to study the effects of UVB and UVA exposure. Wavelength-specific biological damage has been identified such as the formation of sunburn cells (SBC) and pyrimidine dimers after UVB irradiation and alterations of dermal fibroblasts after UVA exposure. These specific effects were selected to evaluate the protection afforded by two sunscreens after topical application on the skin surface. Simplified formulations having different absorption spectra but similar sun protection factors were used. One contained a classical UVB absorber, 2-ethylhexyl-p-methoxycinnamate. The other contained a broad-spectrum absorber called Mexoryl SX, characterized by its strong absorbing potency in the UVA range. Both filters were used at 5% in a simple water/oil vehicle. The evaluation of photoprotection on in vitro reconstructed skin revealed good efficiency for both preparations in preventing UVB-induced damage, as shown by SBC counting and pyrimidine dimer immunostaining. By contrast, only the Mexoryl SX-containing preparation was able to efficiently prevent UVA-specific damage such as dermal fibroblast disappearance. Our data further support the fact that skin reconstructed in vitro is a reliable system to evaluate the photoprotection provided by different sunscreens against specific UVB and UVA biological damage.

"Abstract: Despite frequent use of intravenous (i.v.) cyclosporin A (CsA) in the early post-operative course of transplant recipients, allergic reactions have been infrequently described. Of 134 transplants, we report four pediatric renal transplant recipients with severe reaction to i.v. CsA with pulmonary capillary leak syndrome. Pulmonary edema developed at a mean time of 3.5 h after commencement of i.v. CsA, with two patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Discontinuation of i.v. CsA and conversion to oral CsA was followed by rapid resolution of pulmonary edema, suggesting that cremaphor, the solubilizing agent in the i.v. formulation, is likely to be responsible for this adverse response. Skin prick testing with cremaphor was negative in all patients and alternative mechanisms for the cremaphor response are proposed. It is likely that inadequate mixing of the i.v. CsA solution triggered this reaction, by delivering a higher concentration of cremaphor at the start of the CsA infusion. Pulmonary edema in the early post-transplant course in the absence of obvious fluid overload should prompt the diagnosis of an i.v. CsA reaction. This life-threatening reaction is easily reversible if recognized, and can be managed easily without compromise to the allograft, by discontinuing i.v. CsA and switching early to an oral CsA formulation. "
"OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the new oral microemulsion formulation of cyclosporin A (CyA; Sandimmun Neoral) and the original CyA formulation (Sandimmun), in patients with severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), over a 12-month period. METHODS: In this double-blind, multicentre study, patients were randomized to treatment with Neoral or Sandimmun, starting with 2.5 mg/kg/day, with dose adjustments after 4 weeks. Primary efficacy criteria included patients' assessment of disease activity. Pharmacokinetic and safety assessments were performed at regular intervals. RESULTS: Compared with Sandimmun, Neoral showed a consistent trend towards greater clinical efficacy from week 12 onwards, including a significant difference in patients' assessment of disease activity at the study end-points. A significantly lower increase in dose from baseline was observed with Neoral at week 24. Pharmacokinetic assessments at week 24 showed increased absorption and decreased variability with Neoral. No differences in safety were found between treatment groups. CONCLUSION: These observations indicate that Neoral is as safe and at least as effective as Sandimmun and have important implications for patient management given the increasing role for CyA in the treatment of severe, active RA.

"Abstract: Skin care products are complex formulations that may cause sensory irritation symptoms, characterized by stinging, burning, and itching. Substances capable of counteracting sensory irritation are of great practical interest. Strontium salts have been demonstrated to inhibit sensory irritation and inflammation when applied topically. In this double-blind study, we evaluated the efficacy of strontium nitrate in reducing chemically-induced skin sensory irritation in 8 subjects. In a random order, 20% strontium nitrate in 70% glycolic acid (pH=0.6) (mixture) was applied to the volar aspect of the forearm and a positive control (70% glycolic acid, pH=0.6) to the contralateral forearm. The irritation sensation was evaluated each min for the first 20 min after topical application using a scale from 0-4. The duration of the irritation sensation in min was also recorded. Strontium nitrate mixed with glycolic acid, in comparison with glycolic acid alone, markedly (p<0.01) shortened the duration of the irritation sensation from 24.4+/-4.1 (mean+/-SEM) min to 8.9+/-3.7 (mean+/-SEM) min, and significantly (p<0.05) reduced the mean magnitude of the irritation sensation at all time points (overall). The study demonstrated that strontium nitrate potently suppresses the sensation of chemically-induced irritation. "
"Abstract: Sunscreens are ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-absorbing chemicals that attenuate the amount and nature of UVR reaching viable cells in the skin. They are selected and tested for their ability to prevent erythema. No sunscreen prevents photodamage, as it has been demonstrated that suberythemal doses of UVR cause a variety of molecular changes (including DNA damage) in these cells. Furthermore, the spectrum of UVR reaching viable cells is altered by topically applied sunscreen. In this review, the basic aspects of sunscreens and skin photobiology are reviewed briefly. Although there can be no question concerning the efficacy of sunscreens for the prevention of erythema, questions remain because of the possible cumulative effects of chronic suberythemal doses and the increased exposure of skin cells to longer UVR wavelengths. The current major issue surrounding sunscreens involves their ability to protect skin cells against the effects of UVA radiation. These UVA effects may be direct damage (base oxidations) or effects on the skin immune system, yet there is no uniformly accepted method for the evaluation of UVA protection. This review is focused primarily on the latter topic covering action spectra that implicate the need for UVA protection. In addition, in vivo and in vitro methods proposed for the evaluation of candidate sunscreen formulations of UVA protective ability are reviewed. Finally, revisions in the terminology used to describe the protection afforded by sunscreens are suggested. It is proposed that SPF (""sun"" protection factor) be renamed ""sunburn"" protection factor and that ""critical wavelength"" be designated ""long wave index."" "
"Abstract: The interaction between the UV filter, 2-ethylhexyl-p-dimethylaminobenzoate, and unmodified and modified alpha-, beta- or gamma-cyclodextrins was studied in water by phase-solubility analysis. Of the cyclodextrins available, only hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin caused a marked increase in the aqueous solubility of 2-ethylhexyl-p-dimethylaminobenzoate. The data from the solubility study indicated the formation of a 1:1 (sunscreen-cyclodextrin) complex. The inclusion of the sunscreen agent into the hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin cavity was confirmed by thermal analysis and by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Irradiation-induced degradation of 2-ethylhexyl-p-dimethylaminobenzoate was reduced by complexation with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin, this effect being more pronounced in solution (the extent of degradation was 25.5% for the complex compared with 54.6% for free 2-ethylhexyl-p-dimethylaminobenzoate) than in the emulsion vehicle (the extent of degradation was 25.1% for the complex compared with 33.4% for free 2-ethylhexyl-p-dimethylaminobenzoate). Although photodegradation of the sunscreen agent is significantly reduced by formation of the inclusion complex it is important to design a suitable vehicle. Inclusion of 2-ethylhexyl-p-dimethylaminobenzoate-DMAB into the hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin cavity limits interaction of the UV filter with the skin reducing the side-effects of the formulation.

"Abstract: Glycolic acid is used in many cosmetic products as exfoliant and moisturizer. Unfortunately, the greater glycolic acid cosmetic benefits the greater is the potential for skin irritation as far as burning. The aim of this work was to investigate the feasibility of topical controlled delivery systems loading glycolic acid in order to optimize the acid cosmetic properties lowering its side effects. For this purpose different types of microparticulate systems have been evaluated: liposomes, liposomes modified by chitosan addition and chitosan microspheres. Liposomes, composed of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol (1:1 molar ratio) and with different glycolic acid/lipid molar ratio, were prepared by reverse phase evaporation method. Two types of interaction between liposomes and chitosan were investigated: chitosan addition into lipidic bilayer during liposome preparation and coating of already formed liposomes with chitosan. Glycolic acid loaded chitosan microspheres were prepared by the dry-in-oil emulsion method. The microparticulate systems were morphologically characterized by electron microscopy and particle size analysis. In vitro dissolution tests were performed to evaluate the feasibility of microparticulate systems in modulating glycolic acid release. The results obtained show that liposomes are always suitable to modulate glycolic acid release and that the best condition to achieve this control is obtained by the liposomal systems in which glycolic acid/lipid molar ratio is 5:1. Further significant release control is obtained by addition of chitosan into the liposomes, while chitosan microspheres are not able to control glycolic acid release even after crosslinking. "
"BACKGROUND: Neurological complications after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) have remained a major concern in a small proportion of patients. The etiology of these complications is often thought to be multifactorial: the influence of calcineurin inhibitors is occasionally thought to play an important role. When neurotoxicity occurs after OLTX under tacrolimus, it is usually a minor complication and responds readily to a reduction in the dosage of or a temporary withdrawal of tacrolimus. However, neurotoxic complications occasionally do not respond to this conventional process. Neoral is a microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine. It has more consistent pharmacokinetic parameters and improved bioavailability when compared with conventional cyclosporine. The aim of the present report was to evaluate the role of Neoral in OLTX recipients with neurotoxic complication who failed to respond to a reduction in the dosage of tacrolimus. METHOD: Between August 1995 and November 1997, 330 adults (age >18 years) received primary OLTX under tacrolimus-based immunosuppression (mean age 52.6+/-11.4 years). There were 190 men and 140 women. Twenty-three (7%) patients (mean age 53.2+/-11.8 years; 17 men, 6 women) were converted to Neoral (mean 35+/-41 days after OLTX). These patients were followed until June 1998 (mean follow-up 22.7+/-7.8 months). RESULTS: Four (17.4%) patients died during the follow-up period, and two patients underwent retransplantation. Neurological symptoms improved in all patients who survived. Adequate trough concentrations were achieved in all patients with p.o. Neoral. Nine (39%) patients experienced rejection episodes after conversion. Six (26.1%) patients were converted back to tacrolimus because of ongoing rejection (n=3), retransplantation (n=2), or persistent nausea and vomiting (n=1) without recurrence of the original neurological complication. CONCLUSION: Neurological complications after OLTX disorders that occur under tacrolimus and that fail to respond to a reduction in the dosage can be treated safely by conversion to Neoral. However, the rate of rejection is up to 39%, and patients can often be converted back to tacrolimus without recurrence of the original neurological complication. "
"BACKGROUND: Although cyclosporine (CsA) has been a mainstay in liver transplantation immunosuppression the original formulation [Sandimmune (SIM)] has variable absorption, particularly in children. Neoral is a new formulation of CsA that may have improved biovailability that would be advantageous in children. This study was undertaken to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and effects on outcome of Neoral versus Sandimmune (SIM) in primary pediatric liver transplant recipients. METHODS: Thirty-two patients were randomized to receive Neoral (17 patients) or SIM (15 patients) in the early posttransplant period (days 1-7) in a double-blind fashion. Intravenous CsA was instituted immediately posttransplant followed by Neoral or SIM as soon as the patient was tolerating oral fluids (days 1-7). PK were compared after the first dose (1-7 days), 3 weeks, and 6 and 12 months posttransplant. In addition, side effects, effect of age and food on absorption, and rejection episodes were assessed by intent to treat analysis. Notable characteristics of this study include the use of a central laboratory for all sample analyses and the assessment of renal function using radioisotopic evaluation of glomerular filtration rates. RESULTS: At baseline the two groups were comparable. Neoral resulted in higher peak levels of CsA and total drug exposure with comparable time to peak drug levels at days 1-7 and week 3. This trend was maintained at 6 and 12 months. Time on i.v. CsA was reduced in the Neoral group (8.4 vs. 11.1 days) and the weight adjusted daily dose of SIM required to achieve target trough levels was about 2-fold more than Neoral from day 22 onward. In addition, biopsy proven and treated and steroid-resistant rejection episodes were fewer in the Neoral group (6 vs. 12; P=0.01 and 1 vs. 8: P=0.004, respectively). Side effects were comparable in both treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Neoral was well tolerated and had greater biovailability than SIM without any increase in the incidence of side effects. In addition fewer episodes of rejection were observed with Neoral versus SIM. We conclude that Neoral is the CsA formulation of choice for use in pediatric liver transplant recipients. "
"Abstract: Psoralen photochemotherapy [psoralen ultraviolet A (PUVA)] plays an important part in dermatological therapeutics, being an effective and generally safe treatment for psoriasis and other dermatoses. In order to maintain optimal efficacy and safety, guidelines concerning best practice should be available to operators and supervisors. The British Photodermatology Group (BPG) have previously published recommendations on PUVA, including UVA dosimetry and calibration, patient pretreatment assessment, indications and contraindications, and the management of adverse reactions.1 While most current knowledge relates to oral PUVA, the use of topical PUVA regimens is also popular and presents a number of questions peculiar to this modality, including the choice of psoralen, formulation, method of application, optimal timing of treatment, UVA regimens and relative benefits or risks as compared with oral PUVA. Bath PUVA, i.e. generalized immersion, is the most frequently used modality of topical treatment, practised by about 100 centres in the U.K., while other topical preparations tend to be used for localized diseases such as those affecting the hands and feet. This paper is the product of a recent workshop of the BPG and includes guidelines for bath, local immersion and other topical PUVA. These recommendations are based, where possible, on the results of controlled studies, or otherwise on the consensus view on current practice. "
"Abstract: Individual and combined polyalkylcyanoacrylate nanoparticle formulation of cyclosporin A and doxorubicin were prepared and evaluated in an attempt to show improved growth inhibition efficacy in a resistant cell culture line. The drug loaded nanoparticles were prepared using the well established emulsion polymerization process without using any modification for the hydrophilic doxorubicin drug whereas the incorporation of cyclosporin A needed to wait a moment after the polymerization reaction started. This was necessary to avoid cyclosporin A precipitation and polymer aggregation. Cyclosporin A release from the nanoparticles was rapid probably because the drug was adsorbed onto the nanoparticles surface rather than embedded into the polymeric core. Doxorubicin displayed also a burst effect but with a slower second phase probably related with the nanoparticles bioerosion rate owing to its entrapment in the polymeric network. Finally, it was shown in resistant cell culture experiments that the association of both cyclosporin A and doxorubicin within a single nanoparticle formulation elicited the most effective growth rate inhibition as compared to other combinations of both drugs while using a lower amount of polymer compared to separated nanoparticle formulations. This result was probably due to the synergistic effect achieved by combining the chemo-sensitizing compound cyclosporin A, with an effective cytotoxic drug like doxorubicin. "
"BACKGROUND: Topical corticosteroids are the accepted medical adjunct to surgery in patients suffering from nasal polyposis. Fluticasone propionate (FP) is a potent, topically active corticosteroid which has been formulated as nasal drops specifically for the treatment of polyposis. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate dose-related efficacy and tolerability of FP nasal drops (FPND) in the treatment of mild to moderate bilateral polyposis; in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre international study. METHODS: Adult patients (n = 142) with bilateral nasal polyps were randomized to receive either FPND 400 microg once daily (o.d.), FPND 400 microg twice daily (b.i.d.) or placebo for 12 weeks. The majority then entered a further 12 week open period during which all patients received FPND 400 microg o.d. The primary efficacy endpoint was the physicians' visual assessment of polyp size. Secondary clinical endpoints were nasal blockage and overall rhinitis (0-3 scores), peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF), olfactory function tests, and requirement for polypectomy. The patients also kept twice daily records of symptom scores, peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) and use of rescue medication. RESULTS: At the end of the 12 week randomized treatment period, polyp size was reduced significantly by FPND 400 microg b.i.d. as compared with placebo (P = 0.006). Clinical assessments of nasal blockage and overall rhinitis showed significant improvements at several stages of treatment with both doses of FPND. Clinic PNIF was also improved significantly by both doses of FPND in comparison with placebo, and FPND 400 microg b.i.d. was significantly more effective than 400 microg o.d. (P = 0.045). Patient diary card scores supported the clinical assessments. Two patients on placebo required polypectomy and all treatments were well tolerated with a similar incidence of adverse events. CONCLUSION: FPND 400 microg once or twice daily is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for bilateral nasal polyposis. "
"Abstract: Lamellar ichthyosis (LI) is characterized by generalized scaling of the skin and is often resistant to ordinary emollients. Recently, Locobase(R) fatty cream containing a mixture of 5% lactic acid and 20% propylene glycol (LPL) was found to be markedly effective in a pilot study. To consolidate this finding, a double-blind study comparing LPL with the corresponding mixture in Essex(R) (Diprobase(R)) cream (LPE) and Locobase(R) fatty cream containing either 5% urea or 20% propylene glycol was conducted in 20 patients with LI. Before and after applying the creams twice daily on each of the four extremities for 4 weeks, the following investigations were performed: scoring of xerosis, scaling and erythema, measurements of skin hydration (capacitance) and transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and moulding of the skin surface (replicas). Xerosis was reduced by all four creams, but significantly more so by LPL (P < 0.001) and LPE (P < 0.01). Scaling was only reduced by LPL (P < 0.001) and LPE (P < 0.01), which also caused a slight increase in the erythema score (P < 0.05 for both). The patients' weekly evaluation of symptoms showed that LPL produced the most rapid effect: the response rate after 4 weeks was 63%. Skin hydration and TEWL were both significantly increased by LPL and LPE, whereas skin roughness was reduced most by LPL. Fourteen patients preferred LPL over the other cream formulations. Ten patients continued using LPL for up to 8 weeks with good results and no side-effects other than occasional irritation in the skin folds. LPL is a major advance in the topical treatment of LI that suits most patients. Some patients, however, seem to prefer the more hydrophilic LPE formulation. Both formulations effectively reduce hyperkeratosis and xerosis, but may cause slight irritation and adversely affect the epidermal barrier function. "
"Abstract: Because the vesicant sulfur mustard (HD) remains a major chemical threat from either domestic terrorists or countries in conflict, topical preparations are being evaluated as protectants from HD exposure. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of chloroamide S-330 as a potential reactive component in topical formulations. Therefore, the rate, mechanism and by-products of the oxidation reactions of sulfides by S-330 in solvent media or specific formulation vehicles were investigated. Using NMR, LC, LC-MS and GC-MS, the reactions of S-330 with HD, dibutyl sulfide (DBS) and methyl phenyl sulfide (MPS) were studied in acetonitrile, chloroform and perfluoropolyether (PFPE) oil. The oxidation of the three sulfides with S-330 was very rapid and completed in <4 min in acetonitrile-water or PFPE oil, but the rates of reaction in chloroform were significantly slower. In a large excess of S-330, the major products resulted from chlorination of the side chains. At a high HD/S-330 ratio, the major product was HD sulfoxide. Under both conditions, only a trace of HD sulfone, also a blistering agent, was observed. Reactions with DBS and MPS primarily gave sulfoxides and sulfones, with less side-chain chlorination. The chloroamide S-330 appeared to be a rapid and effective decontaminant of HD in either polar media or in a PFPE oil. The two alkyl and aryl sulfides are suitable simulants of HD for the initial screening and evaluation of S-330 or other similar oxidizing agents. "
"BACKGROUND: Pulsed dye laser treatments usually result in purpura. Any topical application that eliminates or shortens the duration of purpura would be extremely useful. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the safety and efficacy of topical vitamin K cream in shortening the duration of laser-induced purpura. METHODS: Twenty adult subjects were enrolled. Each subject had five 1.5 cm sites treated with a pulsed dye laser at 585 nm, 450 nsec, 7 mm spot size at each subject's respective threshold fluence. Each subject had a control site where no topical application was used and four other sites where a different formulation was applied to each for 2 weeks before and for 2 weeks after laser irradiation. Five vitamin K formulations with or without retinol were studied: 3% vitamin K in acrylates copolymer cream, 5% vitamin K in acrylates copolymer cream, 1% vitamin K and 0.3% retinol in acrylates copolymer cream, 1% vitamin K and 0.15% retinol in acrylates copolymer cream, 1% free vitamin K cream. Purpuric discoloration at each site was rated on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 10, and 14 after laser treatment on a quartile scale. Each site was assigned 100% discoloration on day 0 after laser irradiation. RESULTS: Laser-induced purpuric discoloration resolved faster with 1% vitamin K and 0.3% retinol in acrylates copolymer cream than with no topical application. The difference is statistically significant from day 3 onward. CONCLUSION: A combination of 1% vitamin K and 0.3% retinol in acrylates copolymer cream hastened the resolution of laser-induced purpura. "
"Abstract: A significant number of patients who are receiving radiotherapy experience the distressing side effects of emesis and nausea. Although prophylactic antiemetics are often given to patients who are receiving single-fraction, high-dose radiotherapy to the abdomen, a survey has revealed that antiemetic prophylaxis is not routinely offered to those receiving fractionated radiotherapy. Hence there is a need for an effective treatment of emesis for use in this group of patients. Ondansetron is an effective and well-tolerated antiemetic, which is used for the prevention of both chemotherapy and radiotherapy-induced emesis and nausea. This agent has been developed as a novel freeze-dried oral formulation. Ondansetron orally disintegrating tablets (ondODT) disperse rapidly when placed on the tongue. As the tablet does not need to be swallowed with water, it is a particularly useful formulation for patients who have difficulty with swallowing or who do not feel able to drink. This study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of ondODT in the treatment of established emesis and nausea induced by radiotherapy. Two doses of ondODT, 8 mg and 16 mg, were compared with placebo in patients who developed emesis and/or moderate/severe nausea after receiving fractionated radiotherapy to sites located between the thorax and the pelvis. The study showed that ondODT was clinically superior to placebo in treating emesis and nausea successfully over a 12-hour period after taking the medication. There were no statistically significant differences between the two doses of ondODT. In the 2 hours after taking the study medication, patients who received ondODT (8 mg and 16 mg) had significantly fewer emetic episodes compared with those who received placebo. They also experienced significantly less nausea. In conclusion, ondODT 8 mg is effective in the treatment of radiotherapy-induced emesis and nausea and provides an effective alternative to the conventional ondansetron tablet. "
"BACKGROUND: The microemulsion preconcentrate formulation of cyclosporine A (CsA) (Neoral) exhibits more uniform pharmacokinetics than the conventional formulation (Sandimmun; SIM). This randomized, open-label, U.K. multicenter study compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Neoral and SIM in preventing acute rejection in de novo renal transplant recipients. METHODS: Adult cadaveric kidney recipients (n=293) received Neoral or SIM twice daily for 12 months. Initially identical Neoral and SIM doses were titrated, maintaining trough CsA levels within locally defined therapeutic limits. RESULTS: In the year after transplantation, acute rejection occurred in 34% of the Neoral and 47% of the SIM recipients (P=0.037). In the intent-to-treat population, fewer treatment failures (defined as acute rejection, graft loss, withdrawal, or death) occurred in the Neoral (45%) than the SIM recipients (58%) (P=0.015) and therapeutic CsA levels (> or =250 microg/L) were reached faster with Neoral than SIM (P=0.0017). Antibody treatment of refractory rejection was used slightly less in the Neoral group (Neoral: 10%; SIM: 12%). One-year patient and graft survival rates (excluding deaths with functioning grafts) were 95% and 88%, respectively, for Neoral and 96% and 89% for SIM. Both formulations were well tolerated. No differences were observed between therapies in the nature, frequency, or severity of adverse events. Neoral use was not associated with increased nephrotoxicity or excessive immunosuppression. CONCLUSIONS: Neoral reduced the incidence of acute rejection compared with SIM, without significant increases in adverse events. This was achieved without altering existing SIM protocols and was attributed to improved absorption of CsA from Neoral and less variability in whole blood CsA concentrations. "
"PURPOSE: Investigation of the ability of doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles (NP/Dox) to overcome multidrug resistance (MDR) when they have first been taken up by macrophages. METHODS: The growth inhibition of P388 sensitive (P388) and resistant (P388/ADR) tumor cells was evaluated in a coculture system consisting of wells with two compartments. The tumor cells were seeded into the lower compartment, the macrophages were introduced into the upper part in which the drug preparations were also added. RESULTS: Doxorubicin exerted lower cytotoxicity on tumor cells in coculture compared with direct contact. In P388/ADR, NP/Dox cytotoxicity was far higher than that of free doxorubicin (Dox). Three different formulations of cyclosporin A (either free (CyA), loaded to nanoparticles (NP/CyA) or in a combined formulation with doxorubicin (NP/Dox-CyA)), were added to modulate doxorubicin efficacy. The addition of cyclosporin A to Dox increased drug cytotoxicity. Both CyA added to NP/Dox and NP/Dox-CyA were able to bypass drug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the barrier role of macrophages, NP/Dox remained far more cytotoxic than Dox against P388/ADR. Both NP/Dox + CyA and NP/Dox-CyA allowed to overcome MDR, but the last one should present greater advantage in vivo by confining both drugs in the same compartment, hence reducing the adverse effects.

"Abstract: The barrier integrity of hairless guinea pig skin after treatment with an alpha hydroxy acid was assessed through in vivo topical application of an oil-in-water emulsion containing 5 or 10% glycolic acid at pH 3.0. The control was a commercial moisturizing lotion, pH 7.8. A dosing regimen for the glycolic acid formulations that was tolerated by the hairless guinea pigs and significantly decreased stratum corneum turnover time was determined using the dansyl chloride staining technique. Once-daily dosing of hairless guinea pig skin for 3 weeks with the glycolic acid formulations resulted in approximately a 36-39% decrease in stratum corneum turnover time compared with the control lotion. After this treatment, hairless guinea pigs were sacrificed for the in vitro measurement of the percutaneous absorption of [14C]hydroquinone and [14C]musk xylol. No significant differences in the 24-hour absorption of either test compound were found for skin treated with the control lotion or the glycolic acid formulations. There were also no significant differences found in the absorption of [3H]water through skin from the different treatment groups. Although no increase in skin penetration occurred after treatment with the glycolic acid formulations, histology revealed approximately a twofold increase in epidermal thickness. Also the number of nucleated cell layers nearly doubled in skin treated with 5% and 10% glycolic acid compared with the control lotion and untreated skin. These studies demonstrate that substantial changes in the structure of hairless guinea pig epidermis can occur without significant effect on skin permeability of two model compounds. "
"Abstract: Previous studies of healthy volunteers and small numbers of transplant recipients have suggested that the oral solution formulation of Sandimmune (cyclosporine [CsA]; Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ) is bioequivalent to the soft gelatin capsule (SGC) formulation. However, there is conflicting evidence as to whether the two formulations are bioequivalent in all patients; to date, there are no published studies that explicitly address their bioequivalence in patients. We conducted a randomized, open-label, two-sequence, two-period, crossover study. Of 20 maintenance renal transplant recipients shown by a screening pharmacokinetic (PK) profile to be poor absorbers of CsA, half were randomized to receive first the SGC formulation and half the oral solution formulation for a period of 7 days. Each patient then underwent a 12-hour PK profile on the last day of the assigned formulation before a crossover to receive the other formulation and repeat the 7-day treatment and PK profile cycle. The results showed that peak and total exposure to CsA was greater with the SGC formulation. The SGC-oral solution ratios indicated an average 38% greater peak and 11% greater total exposure for the SGC formulation (P < 0.01 and P = 0.09, respectively). Trough levels were more similar between formulations, with SGC showing an average of 5% greater troughs (P > 0.10). In our selected population of malabsorbers, the SGC formulation made a difference in drug exposure. "
"Abstract: A new formulation of mometasone furoate (MF) for administration by dry powder inhaler (DPI) was evaluated for the treatment of asthma. A 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging study compared the efficacy and safety of three doses of MF DPI (100, 200 and 400 mcg b.i.d) with beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) 168 mcg b.i.d. administered by metered dose inhaler in 365 adult or adolescent patients being treated with inhaled glucocorticoids. The mean change from baseline to endpoint (last treatment visit) for forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) was the primary efficacy variable. Secondary efficacy variables included other objective measures of pulmonary function [forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow 25-75% (FEV25-75%.) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)] as well as subjective measures of therapeutic response (patients' daily evaluation of asthma symptoms and physicians' evaluation). At endpoint, all four active treatments were significantly more effective than placebo (P < 0.01) in improving FEV1 (MF DPI 5 to 7%, BDP 3%, placebo -6.6%) and all other measures of pulmonary function (FVC: MF DPI 4 to 5%, BDP 2%, placebo -4.7%; FEF25-75%: MF DPI 6 to 18%, BDP 7.5%, placebo -9.5%; PEFR (AM): MF DPI 5 to 10%, BDP 5.7%, placebo -7%). A consistent trend was observed for better improvement in patients treated with MF DPI 200 mcg b.i.d. than with MF DPI 100 mcg b.i.d., with no apparent additional benefit of MF DPI 400 mcg b.i.d. Results for the MF DPI 100 mcg b.i.d. and BDP 168 mcg b.i.d. treatment groups were similar. Patients' and physicians' subjective evaluations of symptoms found similar improvement in the MF DPI 200 and 400 mcg b.i.d. treatment groups, which were slightly better than that in the MF DPI 100 mcg b.i.d. group. Symptoms tended to worsen in the placebo group. MF DPI was well tolerated at all dose levels and the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse effects were headache, pharyngitis and oral candidiasis. No evidence of HPA-axis suppression was detected in any treatment group. In summary, all doses of MF DPI were well tolerated and significantly improved lung function and MF DPI 400 mcg (200 mcg b.i.d.) was the optimal dose in this study of patients with moderate persistent asthma.

"Abstract: In order to protect the public against the adverse effects of sunlight, the scientific, medical, and particularly the dermatologic community has promoted ""safe sun exposure."" This strategy includes sun avoidance whenever possible, wearing hats and other protective clothing and/or devices, such as sunglasses, and extensive use of sunscreens. Sunscreen efficacy is determined by measuring the ability of the sunscreen to block ultraviolet (UV)-induced erythema (sun protection factor or SPF), and most sunscreen formulations on the market, if used properly, are very good at preventing erythema and sunburn. How well sunscreens protect against the other adverse effects of sunlight, such as immune suppression, is not as clear. The purpose of this paper is to review and discuss the literature in this area, concentrating on some of the complications of determining how well sunscreens protect against UV-induced immune suppression. "
"OBJECTIVE: To review the efficacy and safety of fenofibrate in the management of hyperlipidemias. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search (1974-October 1998), Current Contents search, additional references from article bibliographies, and the package insert from the manufacturer were used to identify data for evaluation. Studies evaluating fenofibrate (peer-reviewed publications, package insert data) were considered for inclusion. Abstracts and data on file with the manufacturer were not considered for inclusion. STUDY SELECTION: English-language literature was reviewed to evaluate the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical use, and tolerability of fenofibrate. Data from animals and in vitro systems were included only when necessary to explain the drug's pharmacology. DATA SYNTHESIS: Micronized fenofibrate is a fibric acid derivative approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 1998 for the treatment of types IV and V hyperlipidemia. Data from the peer-reviewed literature also support the use of fenofibrate in types IIa, IIb, and III hyperlipidemias. Micronized fenofibrate 67-201 mg/d is useful as monotherapy or as an adjunct to other hypolipidemics and dietary therapy. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, regular formulation fenofibrate 300-400 mg/d lowered serum triglyceride (TG) concentrations by 24-55%, total cholesterol by 9-25%, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations by 6-35%, and raised high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations by 8-38%. Few comparative data exist regarding fenofibrate versus clofibrate and gemfibrozil. In noncomparative and comparative clinical trials, fenofibrate appeared to be well tolerated. The most common causally related adverse events were digestive, musculoskeletal, and dermatologic in nature. Concurrent use of fenofibrate and a hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A inhibitor may increase the risk of myopathy and/or rhabdomyolysis, although recent data suggest that concurrent use of fenofibrate with low-dose simvastatin or pravastatin is safe. Fenofibrate may enhance the effect of oral anticoagulants. CONCLUSIONS: Fenofibrate reduces serum TG, total cholesterol, and LDL-C, and raises HDL-C to clinically relevant degrees. Its spectrum of activity appears to exceed that recommended for types IV and V hyperlipidemia to encompass types IIa, IIb, and III hyperlipidemias as well. To this extent, it may be considered a broader-spectrum fibrate than is indicated by its FDA approval. Adverse effects of fenofibrate appear to be similar to those of other fibrates and require routine monitoring (clinical, liver function). Long-term safety data are readily available from drug registries in many countries where the product has been available for nearly two decades. Cost-effectiveness studies comparing fenofibrate with other hypolipidemics demonstrate benefits of fenofibrate over simvastatin in types IIa and IIb hyperlipidemia. The need for dosage titration of the micronized preparation from 67 mg/d upward to a final dose of 200 mg/d is also not supported by peer-reviewed literature (except in the case of renal impairment). Although preliminary data on plaque regression are encouraging, published clinical studies evaluating the impact of fenofibrate on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are awaited. Micronized fenofibrate is worthy of formulary inclusion. "
"OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the dosing regimen of immunosuppressants necessary to avoid the formation of anti-hGH antibodies in a pig model. ANIMALS: Sixteen pigs were divided into four groups. PROCEDURE: Three different immunosuppressive treatments were tested (group 1: Control (no treatment); group 2: 10 mg; group 3: 20 mg; and group 4: 40 mg cyclosporine; combined with 2 mg azatioprine and 2 mg prednisolone p.o./kg/day). The treatments were given from days -7 to 22. All groups were dosed subcutaneously (s.c.) with 0.5 mg hGH/kg once daily from days 1 to 22. On the first and the last days of dosing blood samples were collected to describe the hGH concentration versus time profile. Before dosing and on days 5, 10, and 15 blood samples were collected for measuring hGH antibody formation. RESULTS: A dose-dependent decrease in white blood cell counts was observed in all immunosuppressive-treated groups. Groups 1 and 2 produced antibodies against hGH during the 22 days of dosing while the formation of antibodies was suppressed in groups 3 and 4. In the control group and group 2 the pharmacokinetic parameters of hGH were influenced by the formation of anti-hGH antibodies. In groups 3 and 4, the pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable on the first and the last day of dosing. CONCLUSION: The formation of anti-hGH antibodies influenced the pharmacokinetics of hGH in pigs, but it could be prevented by immunosuppressive therapy. From the present experiment, a dose of 20 mg cyclosporine, 2 mg azatioprine, and 2 mg prednisolone p.o./kg/day was able to prevent the pigs from producing antibodies without having severe adverse effects. This model may by useful in future experiments using sustained release formulations of hGH, and possibly for other compounds that may induce antibody production in pigs. "
"BACKGROUND: The introduction of cyclosporine has resulted in significant improvement in the survival of cardiac allograft recipients due to decreased mortality from infection and rejection. The original oil-based cyclosporine formulation exhibits variable and unpredictable bioavailability that correlates with an increased incidence of acute and chronic rejection in those patients in whom this is most pronounced. The primary objectives of this prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study in cardiac transplant patients were: to compare the efficacy of cyclosporine microemulsion (CsA-NL) with oil-based cyclosporine (CsA-SM) as measured by cardiac allograft and recipient survival and the incidence and severity of acute rejection episodes; and to assess the safety and tolerability of CsA-NL compared with CsA-SM in this population. This report represents the analysis of results 6 months after transplantation. METHODS: A total of 380 patients undergoing their first cardiac transplant at 24 centers in the United States, Canada, and Europe were enrolled in this double-blind, randomized trial examining the safety and efficacy of CsA-NL versus CsA-SM. Rejection was diagnosed using endomyocardial biopsy and were graded according to standardized criteria of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT). Clinical parameters were monitored during the study. Survival and freedom from were used for analysis as was Fisher's exact test for comparisons between groups. RESULTS: At 6 months after transplantation, allograft and patient survival were the same for both groups. The frequency of ISHLT grade 3A or greater episodes in the two groups was identical. Fewer CsA-NL patients (5.9%) required antilymphocyte antibody (ATG or OKT-3) therapy for rejection compared with the CsA-SM-treated patients (14.1%, P=0.01). Females with ISHLT rejection grade > or = 3A treated with CsA-NL had a 46% lower incidence of rejection compared with the CsA-SM-treated group (31.3% vs. 57.6%, P=0.032). Fewer infections were seen in the CsA-NL. With the exception of baseline and 1 week posttransplant creatinines which were higher in the CsA-NL group, the overall creatinine was not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: This multicenter, randomized study of cardiac transplant recipients documented less severe rejection (in particular those requiring antibody therapy) and a lower incidence of infection in CsA-NL-treated patients. Results from the female subgroup analysis suggest that the improved bioavailability of CsA-NL might reduce the frequency of rejection episodes in female patients. The use of CsA-NL was not associated with an increased risk of adverse events. "
"BACKGROUND: L-asparaginase in combination with methotrexate has synergistic antileukemic activity in a schedule-dependent fashion. A new preparation of L-asparaginase, polyethylene-glycol conjugated (PEG)-asparaginase, is a pharmacologically different formulation of L-asparaginase with distinct properties including a longer half-life and less immunogenic properties. METHODS: Patients with refractory or recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were treated with a combination of methotrexate (MTX), vincristine, PEG-asparaginase, and prednisone (MOAP). The treatment was comprised of MTX, 100 mg/m(2) intravenously (i.v.), over 15 minutes on Days 1 and 14; PEG-asparaginase, 2500 IU/m(2), with a maximum dose of 3750 IU i.v. approximately 4-6 hours after MTX on Days 1 and 14; vincristine, 1.4 mg/m(2) (maximum dose, 2 mg) i.v., over 15 minutes on Days 1, 7, and 14; and prednisone, 200 mg daily orally, on Days 1-5 and 14-19. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with a median age of 34 years (range, 20-74 years) were treated. Eight patients (25%) had ALL that was refractory to prior therapy and 24 patients (75%) had recurrent disease. Seven patients (22%) achieved a complete remission (CR). Five patients (16%) died early due to infections. Features associated with a poor response were high pretreatment lactate dehydrogenase levels and Philadelphia chromosome positive disease. The median duration of CR was 16 weeks and the overall median survival after MOAP therapy was 12 weeks. Anaphylactic reactions were not observed during MOAP combination therapy. CONCLUSIONS: MOAP is an active regimen in patients with refractory or recurrent ALL. This regimen is well tolerated and is not associated with allergic reactions. However, further studies regarding the pharmacologic interaction of MTX with PEG-asparaginase are needed to optimize this regimen. "
"Abstract: The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of a new formulation of cyclosporin-A (CyA) and sulfasalazine (SASP) combination treatment in preventing disability and reducing inflammatory disease activity in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis, as well as to assess the tolerability, safety, and suitability for long-term treatment. Forty five patients with early, active rheumatoid arthritis, (RA) were treated with CyA and SASP combination therapy for 12 months. The patients were evaluated by disease activity and radiologic measurements. The combined CyA and SASP therapy seems to be effective. Disease activity parameters improved within 3 months. The individual treatment response rate according to EULAR response criteria was 78% after a one year treatment period. Five patients were withdrawn due to gastrointestinal side effect and two patients because of lack of efficacy. CyA and SASP combination treatment seems to be effective in early severe RA, and with careful monitoring, side effects can be kept under control. "
"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate microspheres of PLGA containing cyclosporin (CsA) as a subconjunctival drug delivery system and to test their efficacy in the prevention of corneal allograft rejection in the rabbit. METHODS: Rabbits were injected subconjunctivally with a solution of CsA (CsA-AR) (20 animals) or a microsphere suspension of CsA (CsA-MP) (20 animals), with equivalent drug concentrations (15 mg/ml). The concentration of CsA in the aqueous, cornea and blood was measured by radioimmunoassay at different times thereafter. In other rabbits, 40 allogeneic grafts were performed. Animals were divided into four groups that received the following subconjunctival treatments: group 1: AR solution (solvents of CsA-AR solution); group 2: CsA-AR solution; group 3: MP suspension (empty microspheres); group 4: CsA-MP suspension. RESULTS: Mean corneal levels of CsA were 1174+/-830, 918+/-179, 972+/-580, 268+/-182 and 243+/-162 ng/ml at 12, 24 and 48 h and 7 and 14 days after the injection of CsA-AR. For the CsA-MP suspension, corneal concentrations were 1195+/-321, 234+/-147 and 88+/-77 ng/ml at 12, 24 and 48 h but subsequently dropped to undetectable levels. Blood and aqueous levels were undetectable. Treatment with CsA significantly improved the survival time and survival rate of grafts in the CsA-treated groups (2, 4) over grafts in non-CsA-treated groups (1, 3). There was no significant difference in the graft survival curve between groups 2 and 4. CONCLUSION: CsA-containing microspheres might be a promising formulation in the prevention of corneal graft rejection. Since the levels of CsA in blood were undetectable, this treatment might avoid the problems associated with systemic side effects. "
"Abstract: Cyclosporin A is the primary immunosuppressive agent used in cardiac transplantation to maintain chronic immunosuppression. Absorption may be erratic and major side-effects include nephrotoxicity. A recently introduced formulation (Neoral) improves absorption in cystic fibrosis heart-lung transplant recipients, but episodes of rejection have been reported on conversion from the oil-based formulation. A retrospective analysis of 21 paediatric cardiac transplant recipients who had been converted from the oil-based formulation to the micro-emulsified formulation was performed. No clinical rejection episodes occurred following conversion. There was a significant reduction in dose following conversion (p < 0.001). The mean trough level was less on the new formulation (p = 0.04), but there was no difference in coefficient of variation or standard deviation. Mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was significantly less, but there was no difference in the rate of change of GFR on the new formulation. Erratic absorption and deteriorating renal function remain as significant problems in paediatric cardiac transplant recipients despite conversion to the new formulation. "
"PURPOSE: The new microemulsion preconcentrate (MEPC) formulation of ciclosporin has been developed to reduce problems in intestinal absorption and to stabilize fluctuations in blood levels. A multicenter, open-label clinical trial of MEPC was conducted to assess its efficacy and safety in Behçet's disease patients with ocular involvement. METHODS: The patient population comprised 17 de novo patients (patients not previously treated with ciclosporin in the currently available formulation) and 30 patients whose ciclosporin formulation was switched from the conventional formulation to MEPC. The patients were treated with the test formulation for 16 weeks in the former (de novo) group and for 12 weeks in the latter (switched) group. RESULTS: In the de novo group, ocular attacks decreased significantly as compared to the pretreatment incidence in 11 of the 14 patients (78.6%) evaluated after MEPC therapy. Ocular attacks also decreased significantly in the switched group. In the de novo group, visual acuity improved with MEPC therapy in 20 of the 28 eyes (71.4%) examined, and the overall efficacy evaluation was ""improved"" or ""markedly improved"" in 13 of the 16 patients evaluated (81.3%). The one case each of onset of neuro-Behçet's disease and intestinal Behçet's disease observed in the de novo group were regarded as adverse reactions. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that ciclosporin MEPC is useful for controlling the ocular symptoms of Behçet's disease, and that it can be used as effectively and safely as the conventional formulation. "
"Abstract: We performed a 1-year study to determine whether intermittent short courses of the microemulsion formulation of cyclosporin (Neoral) could effectively control plaque psoriasis and whether tapering or abrupt cessation of cyclosporin therapy would influence time to relapse. Four hundred patients with plaque psoriasis were included in this open, multicentre, randomized study. All patients commenced cyclosporin at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg daily. Cyclosporin dosage could be increased to a maximum of 5 mg/kg daily. Treatment was continued until clearance of psoriasis or for a maximum of 12 weeks. Patients were then randomly assigned either to stop cyclosporin abruptly or to have the dose reduced by 1 mg/kg daily each week until cessation. On relapse, patients were given another course of cyclosporin. Patients were followed for at least 1 year, during which they could receive as many treatment courses as necessary. The number of patients who required one, two, three and four treatment courses was 400, 259, 117 and 26, respectively. The median time to relapse after the end of the first treatment period was 109 days in the group of patients randomized to stop cyclosporin abruptly and 113 days in patients randomized to taper off cyclosporin (P = 0.038). More than 30% of patients had not relapsed 6 months after having stopped treatment. After each treatment course, the Kaplan-Meier probability of achieving 75% or more reduction in disease area by day 84 of treatment was 83%, 76%, 73% and 66%, respectively. Mean serum creatinine concentration and blood pressure did not show any clinically significant changes over time. Our results show that intermittent short-course therapy with Neoral, when used in conjunction with topical therapy, is well tolerated and provides effective control of plaque psoriasis for 1 year. Tapering off cyclosporin on treatment cessation induces a slight delay in psoriasis relapse. "
"BACKGROUND: Studies comparing purported antiaging compounds are rare. OBJECTIVE: To compare in a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind study 10% glycolic acid (GA), 2% 2-hydroxy-5-octanoyl benzoic acid (beta-lipohydroxy acid, LSA) and 0.05% all-trans-retinoic acid (RA). METHODS: Women volunteers treated one forearm twice daily with one of the active products and the other one with the vehicle. Comparative evaluations of efficacy were made using histochemistry and quantitative immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Improvement in the various epidermal compartments was the most prominent finding at the RA-treated site. The LSA-treated site also exhibited similar positive changes, although to a lesser degree. GA showed no significant effect. CONCLUSION: In the presently tested concentrations and formulations, RA had a beneficial impact upon the aging epidermis. LSA mimicked RA but with somewhat lesser efficacy. By contrast, GA appeared almost inactive. "
"PURPOSE: Chemotherapeutic regimens that utilize fluorouracil, cytarabine, and doxorubicin have been shown to cause a dermatologic syndrome known as hand-foot syndrome, or palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES). Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin has proven effective in the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, ovarian cancer refractory to platinum and paclitaxel therapies, and metastatic breast cancer. In a study of the treatment of refractory epithelial cell ovarian cancers with lipozomal doxorubicin utilizing intravenous doses of 50 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks, grade 3 PPES was observed in 29% of patients (10/35) and required dose reductions and/or dose delay after a median of three therapy cycles. METHODS: Current methods to prevent pegylated liposomal doxorubicin-induced PPES include dose reduction, lengthening of the drug administration interval and ultimately, drug withdrawal. Topical 99% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) also has shown strong activity in treating tissue extravasation reactions during intravenous administration of doxorubicin. RESULTS: Two patients undergoing chemotherapy with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, 50 mg/m(2) every 4 weeks, developed grade 3 PPE after three cycles. Their PPES resolved over a period of 1 to 3 weeks while receiving topical 99% DMSO four times daily for 14 days. CONCLUSIONS: While these results are promising, patients must be treated in a prospective study of this topical DMSO formulation to definitively document its therapeutic efficacy. "
"Abstract: Multicenter clinical trials conducted in the United States and Europe to compare the efficacy and safety of cyclosporine with tacrolimus (FK506) have demonstrated comparable long-term patient survival and graft survival in liver and renal transplant recipients. Importantly, treatment with tacrolimus was associated with reductions in the incidence and severity of acute rejection episodes. However, tacrolimus-based therapy was also associated with increased toxicities in comparison to conventional cyclosporine-based therapy. It is becoming increasingly accepted that earlier trials may have employed high or supratherapeutic doses of tacrolimus and may have been unbalanced with respect to study design. In addition, these pivotal comparative trials were performed with the original formulation of cyclosporine, and not the cyclosporine microemulsion preparation. This critical review of the literature focuses on the United States and European tacrolimus multicenter clinical trials and examines the efficacy and safety of the two primary immunosuppressants, cyclosporine and tacrolimus, obtained in these and other studies. The preliminary findings of ongoing studies comparing the efficacy and safety of the improved formulation, cyclosporine microemulsion, with tacrolimus are also discussed. The overall efficacy of the two agents appears to be similar. The safety profile shows differing toxicities of the two medications. The availability of these two immunosuppressants allows the clinician improved options when choosing an immunosuppressive regimen in solid organ transplantation. "
"BACKGROUND: None of the existing options for long-term testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) for hypogonadal men are ideal. Depot replacement at frequent intervals and implants are effective but invasive and inconvenient for the patient. Oral therapy results in poor hormone levels. Both are associated with undesirable metabolic changes. A transdermal formulation therefore represents a potential therapeutic advance for testosterone replacement. OBJECTIVE: To carry out a clinical audit of the acceptability and efficacy as a treatment for hypogonadism of the first transdermal testosterone therapy available in the UK (Andropatch, SmithKline Beecham) compared with existing androgen replacement options. PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Serum testosterone and questionnaire data on treatment efficacy, side-effects, therapy preference, sexual dysfunction and partner's attitudes to therapy were obtained from 50 hypogonadal men prescribed long-term testosterone replacement. RESULTS: Eighty per cent of the men returned analysable questionnaires. Eighty-four per cent experienced adverse effects with transdermal therapy, most commonly dermatological problems; 22% of the sample elected to continue with transdermal therapy, 72% returned to depot and 5% returned to oral therapy. The reservoir patches were judged to be too large, uncomfortable, visually obtrusive and noisy. Testosterone levels were comparable to those obtained with depot replacement with the added advantage of a more physiological pharmacokinetic profile. Men taking oral preparations were consistently under-replaced. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse events were substantially higher than reported from clinical trials but in keeping with the spectrum of yellow card reports received by the Committee on Safety of Medicines. The pharmacokinetic advantages are thus largely outweighed by low patient acceptability. In its present form transdermal therapy remains an expensive option for those who cannot tolerate depot testosterone replacement. "

"BACKGROUND: Adapalene and tretinoin are topical compounds active for treating acne. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacity and safety of adapalene 0.1% gel and tretinoin 0.05% gel in moderately severe facial acne using clinical and objective biometrological assessments. Such information is currently lacking in the literature. METHODS: The split-face method was used in 25 acne volunteers for a 6-week treatment. In addition to clinical counts of lesions, the amount of comedones was assessed using computer-assisted morphometry of cyanoacrylate follicular biopsies. The erythema index and squamometry values were used to quantitate skin irritation. RESULTS: The tretinoin formulation brought better comedolysis and clinical improvement than the adapalene formulation. Erythema was transiently more pronounced on the tretinoin-treated side. Squamometry yielded no significant difference between both products. CONCLUSION: Tretinoin 0.05% gel exhibits a greater anti-acne efficacy than adapalene 0.1% gel, although with temperate tolerability. "
"PURPOSE: The short-term toxicological effects of two cyclosporine A eyedrop formulations are compared. METHODS: Formula A was based on Sandimmune (Novartis, Switzerland) infusion concentrate with a final ethanol concentration of 1% (w/w), and formula B on Sandimmune oral solution. Both formulations were diluted in sterile peanut oil (10 mg/ml). The left eyes of 12 rabbits were treated with the cyclosporine eyedrops over a two-week period. The right eyes served as controls. Slit-lamp and scanning electron microscopic examinations were performed, and the total protein concentration in aqueous humor was measured in treated and control eyes. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Both Sandimmune oral solution and infusion concentrate-derived eyedrops were found to be non-toxic to rabbit eyes and there were no significant differences between the two formulations. More definite conclusions as to the safety of these cyclosporine formulations cannot be made without long-term trials. "
"Abstract: A total of 427 cancer patients receiving cyclophosphamide chemotherapy participated in this multicenter, double-masked, double-dummy, parallel-group, randomized study comparing the antiemetic efficacy and safety of an 8-mg conventional ondansetron tablet (OT, n = 212) taken twice daily with an 8-mg orally disintegrating ondansetron tablet (ODT, n = 215) taken twice daily for 3 days. In the primary efficacy analysis, complete or major control of emesis (0 to 2 emetic episodes) between days 1 and 3 was seen in 80% of OT and 78% of ODT patients. The 90% confidence interval for the differences between treatments was -8.6% to 4.4% (defined interval of equivalence, +/-15%), showing that the formulations were equivalent. In the secondary efficacy analysis, no significant differences were observed in the rates of complete control of emesis (no episodes of emesis) over 3 days (63% and 64% of the respective groups) and on day 1 (84% and 81%, respectively) and in the complete control of nausea over 3 days (37% and 43%, respectively) and on day 1 (59% and 61% of patients, respectively). The taste of ODT was acceptable to the majority of patients (89%) who received it. OT and ODT were both well tolerated. Thus 8 mg ODT twice daily represents a palatable, well-tolerated, and effective antiemetic treatment for the control of cyclophosphamide-induced emesis and nausea and provides equivalent treatment to OT 8 mg twice daily.

"BACKGROUND: Despite two decades of use, there are limited data on the best way to administer and monitor cyclosporine (CsA) for liver transplantation. The present study was undertaken (1) to determine whether treatment with a new formulation of CsA, Neoral, would improve the results of liver transplantation; and (2) to study the relationships between pharmacokinetic parameters and clinical outcomes after transplantation. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, comparison of Sandimmune (SIM) with Neoral (NEO) was conducted at five Canadian centers in 188 consecutive adults undergoing primary orthotopic liver transplantation. Patients were induced with intravenous CsA then switched to NEO or SIM. Dose adjustments were made daily, or as needed, to reach a target trough CsA level of 350 ng/ml in both groups. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed on days 5, 10, 15, and 16 weeks after transplantation. RESULTS: The NEO group was slightly younger, with a median age of 50 years (range: 23-70) versus 55 years (range: 24-71) for SIM (P = 0.007); otherwise the two groups were well balanced. The NEO group stopped intravenous CsA earlier (5.8+/-2.6 days vs. 8.7+/-4.7 days, P<0.0001). This group required a lower median daily oral dose (7.5 mg/kg vs. 9.0 mg/kg, P<0.01) to maintain comparable trough CsA levels. Five SIM patients, but no NEO patients, discontinued the study due to the inability to reach target trough levels of CsA within the prescribed time (P<0.05). At 4 months, there were no differences between the two groups with respect to patient survival (93% NEO vs. 91% SIM), graft survival (90% NEO vs. 86% SIM), and rejection-free survival (54.1% NEO, 51.8% SIM). The incidence of serious adverse events was also similar and did not correlate with CsA pharmacokinetic profiles. The NEO group had a higher area under the drug concentration curve for the first 6 hr after the dosing interval (AUC0-6) and peak CsA levels (Cmax). There was a strong correlation between freedom from graft rejection during the first month after transplantation and (a) AUC0-6 and (b) Cmax at days 5 and 10 after transplantation, but only in the NEO group did this reach statistical significance. In contrast, there was a poor correlation between trough CsA and graft rejection. In patients on NEO, the concentration of CsA 2 hr after dosing (C2) closely reflected AUC0-6 (r2 = 0.93), whereas there was a poorer correlation in patients on SIM (r2 = 0.73) CONCLUSIONS: Cmax and/or AUC0-6 may provide better markers than trough levels for monitoring CsA-based immune suppression after orthotopic liver transplantation. Prospective studies are underway to determine whether dosing to C2, which provides a good estimation of Cmax, can be used to take full advantage of NEO's improved absorption profile. "
"Abstract: Due to the large variations in the absorption and bioavailability of conventional cyclosporine A (CyA), 1:1 (mg:mg) conversion to its microemulsion formulation (Neoral) has been advocated in transplant recipients. However, the renal hazards and biochemical effects of such conversions and not known in cardiac transplant recipients. In this study, 68 cardiac transplant recipients who were receiving conventional CyA, for a period of 61.3 +/- 36.0 (mean +/- standard error (SE)) months, were switched to the microemulsion formulation (Neoral). The biochemical and renal function tests were evaluated at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months pre- and post-conversion of CyA. The results obtained post-conversion were compared with those of the baseline (pre-conversion). Serum creatinine and uric acid levels significantly increased post-conversion to the microemulsion formulation. One patient required discontinuation of the microemulsion in an attempt to reverse severe renal failure. In spite of a significant decrease in the microemulsion dose at 6, 9 and 12 months, there was a significant increase in the whole blood CyA trough levels at 9 and 12 months of conversion. There was no significant change in blood pressure, serum total cholesterol or potassium post-conversion. Our results suggest that after 1:1 (mg:mg) conversion of CyA to its microemulsion formulation, there will be a significant rise in serum creatinine, uric acid and whole blood trough CyA levels necessitating significant dose reduction. This effect is probably due to the markedly improved absorption and bioavailability of the latter. "
"Abstract: The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of Claritin-D 24 Hour (once daily) with that of Claritin-D 12 Hour (twice daily) and placebo in the treatment of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, 469 patients with moderate-to-severe SAR symptoms were treated for 2 weeks with one of the following: Claritin-D 24 Hour (a combination tablet formulation of loratadine 10 mg in the coating and pseudoephedrine sulfate 240 mg in an extended-release core), Claritin-D 12 Hour (a combination tablet formulation of loratadine 5 mg in the tablet coating and 120 mg pseudoephedrine sulfate, 60 mg in the coating and 60 mg in the core), or placebo. Claritin-D 24 Hour and Claritin-D 12 Hour were consistently superior to placebo (P < 0.01) in reducing total, nasal, and nonnasal symptom scores. Patients in the Claritin-D 24 Hour and Claritin-D 12 Hour groups also had significantly greater (P </= 0.05) relief of rhinorrhea and nasal stuffiness as compared with placebo. Insomnia was reported significantly more often (P < 0.01) in Claritin-D 12 Hour (15%) patients compared with Claritin-D 24 Hour (4%) and placebo (2%) patients. Dry mouth was reported significantly more often (P < 0.05) in Claritin-D 24 Hour (13%) and Claritin-D 12 Hour (13%) groups compared with placebo (4%). Claritin-D 24 Hour has efficacy comparable to Claritin-D 12 Hour in relieving allergic rhinitis symptoms while producing significantly less insomnia. "
"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may be converted, on a milligram-to-milligram basis, from conventional cyclosporin A (CyA, Sandimmun) to the microemulsion formulation (Neoral) with maintenance of longterm safety, and to compare cyclosporin A (CyA) pharmacokinetics between formulations. METHODS: In this double blind, multicenter, parallel group study, 51 patients receiving stable conventional CyA maintenance treatment were randomized to continue conventional CyA (n = 27) or to convert to CyA microemulsion (n = 24) and were monitored for 52 weeks. Trough blood CyA levels were measured before and at intervals after conversion. CyA steady-state area under the curve was assessed one week before and 2 and 6 weeks after randomization in 15 patients in each treatment arm. CyA trough levels and pharmacokinetic results remained unknown to investigators throughout the study. CyA doses were titrated as necessary on the basis of clinical evaluation and disease activity assessments. RESULTS: Initial mean daily doses were 3.5 mg/kg/day (conventional CyA) and 3.3 mg/kg/day (CyA microemulsion) and did not change significantly during the study. The mean bioavailability of CyA from the microemulsion formulation was 23% higher than from conventional CyA. Replicate assessments indicated a more reproducible pharmacokinetic profile with CyA microemulsion. The overall incidence and nature of adverse events and changes in vital signs and laboratory variables were similar in both groups. No clinically relevant differences in efficacy were found between treatments. No loss of efficacy and no tolerability problems occurred after conversion from conventional to microemulsion CyA. CONCLUSION: Existing CyA dosing guidelines, formulated for conventional CyA, are suitable for longterm CyA microemulsion therapy of patients with RA. These results indicate the pharmacokinetic advantages of the microemulsion formulation. "
"Abstract: Cyclosporine (Sandimmune; Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd) is an effective immunosuppressive drug, but its lipid formulation and variable absorption may expose children to the risk of rejection during episodes of gastroenteritis after liver transplantation. Neoral (Novartis) is a microemulsified form of cyclosporine that may be better absorbed. In this study, the pharmacokinetic profiles of Neoral and Sandimmune were compared in stable children after liver transplantation to evaluate whether Neoral is more predictably absorbed. Eight children, 6 boys and 2 girls, with a mean age of 4.5 years (range, 1.2-12) were studied between 4 and 12 months after liver transplantation. Pharmacokinetic profiles were performed on each child by using the same dose (mg/kg) of Neoral or Sandimmune. Tmax, Cmax, Ctrough, and the area under the curve (AUC) were calculated and side effects were documented in children taking either drug for more than 3 months. Mean peak cyclosporine levels were higher and were achieved significantly sooner with Neoral (Cmax 790.5 +/- 216.5 ng/mL, P =.06; Tmax 1.8 +/- 1.0 hr, P =.01) than with Sandimmune (Cmax 589.4 +/- 313 ng/mL, Tmax 2.5 +/- 1.7 hr), implying more rapid and better absorption. There was no significant difference in overall drug exposure (AUC) and 12-hour trough levels between the two formulations (P >.05). Children with Roux-en-Y loop biliary anastomosis taking Neoral, however, showed greater increases in AUC (mean increase = 37%) than those with duct-to-duct anastomosis (mean increase = 16%). There was no correlation between 12-hour trough level and AUC for either Neoral (r2 = 0.48) or Sandimmune (r2 = -0.08); however, for both drugs, AUC correlated very well with the 2-hour post-dose level (r2 = 0.68 and 0.7, respectively). Hirsutism was reported in 4 of 6 children on Neoral and may be associated with higher peak levels. Neoral is more consistently absorbed than Sandimmune in children after liver transplantation and may be more effective prophylaxis against rejection. Because of the increased peak levels and drug exposure, which may influence side effects, particularly in children with Sandimmune malabsorption, we recommend a 1:0.75 dose conversion ratio in patients being converted from Sandimmune to Neoral. "
"BACKGROUND: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an inhibitor of purine nucleotide de novo synthesis leading to impaired proliferation of activated lymphocytes. Studies in animals show a synergistic effect of MMF and cyclosporine (CsA) in preventing acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. We performed a pilot study evaluating the feasibility of the combined application of MMF and CsA as GVHD prophylaxis after allogeneic blood stem cell transplantation. Toxicity and the bioavailability of MMF in this setting were investigated. METHODS: Fourteen patients who had received grafts from HLA-compatible siblings received 2 g of oral MMF from day 1 to 14 combined with intravenous CsA at 4 mg/kg starting at day-1. Plasma levels of mycophenolic acid (MPA) and its glucoronide were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Fifteen patients treated with a combination of CsA and methotrexate at the same institution were referred to as the control group. RESULTS: Trilineage engraftment was achieved in all study and control patients. Acute GVHD > or = grade II was observed in 46.5% and 60% of the study and control patients, respectively. No major differences in the rate of acute toxicities were detectable. The mean trough blood level of MPA in 10 patients was 0.28 microg/ml, and 5.7 microg/ml for MPA glucoronide. Reduced peak levels of MPA indicate a reduced absorption rate of MMF in the early posttransplant phase. CONCLUSIONS: The combined administration of MMF and CsA was shown to be feasible in patients after allogeneic blood stem cell transplantation. Because of the decreased bioavailability of MMF, dose-finding studies for an intravenous formulation are warranted. "
"Abstract: The greater and more consistent absorption of cyclosporine from the microemulsion formulation (Neoral; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Frimley, UK) when compared with that from the original form (Sandimmune; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Frimley, UK) results in greater systemic exposure. Lung transplant recipients could particularly benefit from this enhanced exposure, but not at the expense of excessive cyclosporine toxicity. We compared the pharmacodynamics of Neoral and Sandimmune over the first postoperative year in 50 lung transplant recipients. Twenty-eight patients were randomly selected to receive Neoral and 22 to receive Sandimmune. Nine patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) were randomly selected independently (5, Neoral; 4, Sandimmune). Patients were maintained on similar trough blood cyclosporine concentrations (C0) throughout the 12-month follow-up. A limited blood sampling strategy was adopted to compare the pharmacokinetics of the two formulations at the end of weeks 1 to 4, and of weeks 13, 26, 39, 52. The influence of any difference between the pharmacokinetics of Neoral and Sandimmune on either efficacy or toxicity of the drug was investigated during the follow-up period. Patients in the Neoral and the Sandimmune groups were matched demographically. There were no differences in dose-normalized blood cyclosporine concentrations measured predose (C0) or 6 hours postdose between the two groups. However, the measurement at 2 hours postdose (C2) and the total AUC0-6 were significantly greater in the Neoral group in both CF and non-CF patients at all visits (p < 0.001). Non-CF patients required 9% lower doses of Neoral to achieve comparable C0 measurements to those patients receiving Sandimmune. However, patients with CF required 2 to 3 times the dose of both Neoral and Sandimmune to achieve the same C0 as non-CF patients. The linear rejection rate in the Sandimmune group was 1.87 episodes per patient year, which was similar to the rejection rate of 1.97 episodes per patient year in the Neoral group. Serial lung function, blood biochemistry and hematology, mortality and the incidence of severe renal dysfunction, hypertension, infection, seizures, and new-onset diabetes were all similar in the two groups. Despite equivalent C0, those in the Neoral group were consistently exposed to greater blood cyclosporine concentrations during the dosing interval than those in the Sandimmune group. This did not increase the incidence of serious cyclosporine-associated side effects or influence the rate of acute rejection either. When data from the Neoral and Sandimmune groups were combined, measurements of C0 but not C2 or C6 were associated with the risk of acute lung allograft rejection. "
"BACKGROUND: Cyclosporin A (CsA) has been shown to be highly effective in the therapy of atopic dermatitis (AD). However, little information exists on the treatment of AD patients with Sandimmun Neoral(R) (Neoral), a microemulsion of CsA with improved pharmacokinetic properties in comparison to Sandimmun(R). OBJECTIVE: We have compared the efficacy and tolerability of Sandimmun and Neoral. METHODS: In a randomised, monocentric, double-blind, cross-over pilot study (n = 14), each formulation was administered for 8 weeks, followed by switching to the other treatment group for another 8 weeks. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of therapy, the improvement under Neoral therapy was significantly higher than with Sandimmun (disease activity p = 0.047; extent of disease p = 0.016). In contrast, after 8 weeks of therapy, both formulations yielded similar improvement in the patients' condition. CONCLUSION: While both formulations are effective and well tolerated in the treatment of severe AD, Neoral may have a faster onset of action and higher initial efficacy, which makes it an adequate replacement for Sandimmun.

"Abstract: Adapalene 0.1% gel (Differin gel) is a recently introduced topical treatment for mild to moderate acne which has been demonstrated to be much better tolerated and at least as effective as tretinoin 0.025% gel. We compared the tolerance of adapalene 0.1% gel with six different formulations and concentrations of tretinoin. A total of 55 healthy human subjects were enrolled in two controlled, randomized, observer blinded, intraindividual comparison studies. In the first study, adapalene 0.1% gel was evaluated for its 21-day cumulative irritation potential compared with tretinoin 0.025%, 0.05% and 0.1% cream, tretinoin 0.01% and 0.025% gel, and petrolatum (control). In the second study, adapalene 0.1% gel was evaluated for its 21-day cumulative irritation potential compared with tretinoin 0.025%, 0.05% and 0.1% cream, tretinoin 0.1% gel microsphere, and petrolatum (control). In both studies, cumulative irritation scores helped to define three groups of common irritancy potential, with significant differences between each group. In study A, the three groups were in descending order of irritancy: tretinoin 0.1% cream and tretinoin 0.05% cream; tretinoin 0.025% gel, tretinoin 0.01% gel and tretinoin 0.025% cream; adapalene 0.1% gel and petrolatum (control). In study B, the three groups were in descending order of irritancy: tretinoin 0.1% cream; tretinoin 0.05% cream, tretinoin 0.025% cream and tretinoin 0.1% gel microsphere; adapalene 0.1% gel and petrolatum (control). The experimental results show that adapalene 0.1% gel is significantly better tolerated than any of six formulations of tretinoin, including two gels, three creams and a microsphere formulation, ranging in potency from 0.01% to 0.1%. "
"Abstract: A randomized, investigator masked, intra individual comparative study was conducted in 30 healthy volunteers to compare the cutaneous effects of adapalene 0.1% gel and adapalene 0.1% cream with their respective vehicles, using tretinoin 0.05% cream (n = 21) or tretinoin 0.1% cream (n = 9) and a tretinoin cream vehicle (n = 30) as controls. The products were applied to hip/buttock skin for 4 days under occlusive conditions. Cytosolic retinoic acid binding protein-II (CRABP-II) mRNA levels were measured using the RT-PCR technique in punch biopsies taken from 10 subjects. Epidermal thickness was assessed using image analysis of haematoxylin and eosin stained sections from another 11 subjects. Erythema was assessed in all subjects both by a visual scoring system and by chromameter. Adapalene 0.1% gel and adapalene 0.1% cream produced similar significant increases in CRABP-II mRNA levels compared to their vehicles (P < 0.01). The two tretinoin formulations also resulted in similar significant increases in CRABP-II compared to the cream vehicle (P < 0.001). However, only the two tretinoin formulations resulted in an increase in epidermal thickness and only the tretinoin 0.1% cream resulted in significant erythema. Adapalene 0.1% gel and adapalene 0.1% cream induce RAR-mediated gene expression to a similar degree in this model, without the irritant effects of tretinoin. "
"Abstract: Interest in protection against solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) among the general public in Australia has been increasing steadily as a result of the 'SunSmart' campaigns run by the various state cancer councils. This increasing awareness is due in part to the requirements for occupational protection of outdoor workers and to provision of UVR protection for the recreational market. Behaviour outdoors can significantly affect exposure to solar UVR and use of items of personal protection can provide a substantial reduction in the UVR dose received. The protective properties of sunscreens, sunglasses, hats and clothing against UVR have been the subject of considerable research for some time, and over the last few years interest has extended to the provision of shade structures and the UVR protection provided by various commonly used materials. These materials include shadecloth, plastics, glass, windscreens and applicable tints. Australia has rigorous standards covering protection and UVR, in particular for sunscreens [Standards Australia/Standards New Zealand, Sunscreen products-evaluation and classification, Report No. AS 2604, Sydney/Wellington, 1993.], sunglasses [Standards Australia, Sunglasses and fashion spectacles-nonprescription types, Report No. AS 1067.1, Sydney, 1990.], protective eyewear [Standards Australia/Standards New Zealand, Eye protectors for industrial applications, Report No. AS/NZS 1337, Sydney/Wellington, 1992.] and shadecloth [Standards Australia, Synthetic shadecloth, Report No. AS 4174, Sydney, 1994.]. Compliance with the sunglass standard became mandatory in 1988 and UVR protection provided by sunglasses has increased substantially since then. In July 1996 a standard on 'sun protective textiles' [Standards Australia/Standards New Zealand, Sun protective clothing-evaluation and classification, Report No. AS/NZS 4399, Sydney, 1996.] incorporating ultraviolet protection factors (UPFs) and a rating scheme with protection categories, was introduced; this was the first of its kind in the world. Australian Radiation Laboratory (ARL) UPF swing tags with UVR protection advice from the Australian Cancer Society on the reverse side are used to denote the amount of protection against solar UVR provided by clothing. To date in excess of 5 million ARL swing tags have been issued. Work on the various standards is continuing. The maximum allowed 'sun protection factor' (SPF) limit for sunscreens may be increased to SPF 30 + in the near future, and additions to the sun protective textiles standard are also planned. This paper discusses measurement methods, results, the rationale used in formulating the Australian Standards and the current state of UVR protection in Australia. "
"Abstract: Velac, a new gel formulation containing both tretinoin (0.025%) and clindamycin phosphate (1.2%), is effective in acne vulgaris using a once daily application. The single formulation enhances compliance in young patients and improves the therapeutic results. Treatment with Velac was found to be more effective than tretinoin alone in inflamed lesions and at least comparable in open and closed comedones. In two of the three studies the overall acne severity grade was significantly more reduced when compared with tretinoin. Velac is also more effective than clindamycin alone in the treatment of the non-inflamed lesions. In the two multicentre studies the reduction of the overall acne severity grade was also more favourable for the new gel formulation. A more rapid response occurred with Velac than with either component used (clindamycin or tretinoin) alone. "
"BACKGROUND: The new microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine (Neoral) has been developed in an effort to improve the reliability of drug absorption. The objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Neoral compared to the original formulation (Sandimmun) in liver transplant recipients. METHODS: In a double-blind, parallel group study conducted in 28 centers across Europe and the United States, patients receiving primary orthotopic liver allografts were randomized within 24 hr of transplantation, 198 to Neoral and 192 to Sandimmun. Patients with and without T-tube biliary drainage were included. Postoperatively, all patients also received intravenous (i.v.) cyclosporine, together with prednisolone and azathioprine. Antibody induction was excluded. Efficacy measures were rejections, graft failure, patient survival, and the efficacy of the study medication in achieving the desired cyclosporine blood levels. Safety was assessed by reported adverse events, blood pressure, serum creatinine, and other routine laboratory measurements. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that the Neoral group performed better than the Sandimmun group, with the estimates for patients free of treated rejection and histologically confirmed rejection either showing or approaching statistical significance at the 5% level. By 52 weeks, 5.8% (95% confidence limits: -4.4-15.9%) fewer patients required treatment of acute rejection in the Neoral group. The proportion of patients experiencing at least one treated rejection episode by 2 weeks was 29.8% for Neoral and 43.2% for Sandimmun. For histologically confirmed rejection, these proportions were 32.8% and 44.3%, respectively. The proportion of patients experiencing at least one steroid-resistant rejection was 2.0% for Neoral and 6.3% for Sandimmun at week 2, and 3.0% and 9.9%, respectively, at week 3. All these differences were significant at P<0.05. By 52 weeks, graft failure was 6.3% on Neoral and 11.4% on Sandimmun, with respective patient survival figures of 85.4% and 85.8%. The median duration of the initial episode of i.v. cyclosporine was 4.0 days for Neoral, compared to 6.5 days for Sandimmun (P<0.001). Within the first 2 weeks, a larger percentage of patients in the Neoral group reached the lower target level of cyclosporine (P< or =0.01). The weight-adjusted daily doses of study medication were lower in the Neoral group (median dose: 4.86 vs. 5.42 mg/kg/day, P=0.001), but the blood levels of cyclosporine showed no difference. For those with a T-tube, more of the patients on Neoral remained free of treated rejection throughout the study period (P=0.042, Wilcoxon). By week 2, 44.9% of these patients in the Sandimmun group required treatment for rejection compared to 30.2% in the Neoral group (P=0.007). There was no significant difference between the groups for serum creatinine, blood pressure, other biochemical and hematological variables, or reported adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In liver transplantation in the normal clinical setting, the pharmacokinetic advantages of Neoral translate into clinical superiority over Sandimmun without a negative impact on safety. Recent data indicate that it is not optimal to use i.v. cyclosporine initially in this type of study, but the benefit was seen despite this. In keeping with the previous pharmacokinetic studies, patients managed by T-tube biliary drainage, and hence with no or limited bile available in the gastrointestinal tract, did particularly well with Neoral.

"AIM: To investigate the efficacy, tolerability and safety of a new oral formulation of Sandimmun-Sandimmun Neoral in severe refractory atopic dermatitis in an open, multicenter study. METHODS: The study was conducted in three parts. After 2 weeks of screening, Sandimmun Neoral was commenced at a dose of 3 mg/kg per day and continued until remission or for a maximum of 8 weeks, after which the dose was reduced by half and continued for another 2 weeks and then discontinued. After the treatment period, patients were followed up first for 8 weeks and then until relapse or for a maximum of 24 weeks. SUBJECTS: Twenty-three patients with severe refractory atopic dermatitis (15 females, eight males) mean age 27.2 +/- 14.6 years (range 13-70 years) entered and 22 patients completed the study (one drop-out due to withdrawal of consent). RESULTS: After the end of the full-dose (mean duration 6.5 weeks) and half dose treatment periods, the SCORAD index decreased by 82 and 90%, respectively. Improvement started as early as at 2 and 4 weeks of treatment (mean reduction in SCORAD: 37.5 and 71.7%). At the end of the treatment phase, reductions in EDS, intensity of disease, DSS, pruritus, and sleep loss were 85, 88, 79, 85 and 96%, respectively. The overall efficacy was assessed as very good or good in 96 and 100% of the patients at the end of treatment and after 8 weeks follow-up, respectively. During the follow-up of 24 weeks after treatment, 73% of the patients had a relapse, whereas 27% were still in remission at the end of 24 weeks. In the 22 patients who completed the study, no adverse events were noted which would have necessitated dose reduction or drug withdrawal. Tolerability was assessed as very good or good in 91 and 96% of the patients, at the end of treatment and after 8 weeks follow-up, respectively. Adverse events observed were: nausea (18%), hirsutism (9%), headache (4.5%), epigastric pain (4.5%), paresthesia (4.5%), furuncle (4.5%), and herpes labialis (4.5%). No significant changes in vital signs, hematological and biochemical parameters and serum creatinine were observed during the study except eosinophilia which was reduced by 40% towards the end of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that short-term (8 weeks), low dose (3 mg/kg per day) Sandimmun Neoral treatment is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatment for atopic dermatitis refractory to conventional treatment modalities and can lead to long-term remission of the disease in some patients. However, a double-blind, placebo controlled, long-term follow-up study would be necessary to confirm these results. "
"BACKGROUND: A formulation containing agents affecting the non-inflammatory as well as the inflammatory lesions of acne vulgaris at the same time would be efficient, probably showing a high efficacy and possibly a considerable shortening of the duration of treatment. One single formulation would simplify drug administration thereby enhancing patient compliance and possibly leading to improved therapeutic results. In two studies this seems to have been corroborated for the fixed clindamycin phosphate-tretinoin gel formulation. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to assess whether the recently developed fixed formulation of 1.2% clindamycin phosphate and 0.025% tretinoin in a gel base (Velac), further referred to as Clindamycin phosphate Tretinoin Gel is at least as effective as a proprietary 0.025% tretinoin gel formulation (Aberela, Janssen Cilag Ab, Sollentuna, Sweden; further defined as tretinoin) showing an additional anti-inflammatory effect in the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris. METHODS: In a double-blind, randomised study 72 patients were treated with CTG and 73 with tretinoin gel in a once daily regimen for 12 weeks. Responses, irritation as well as possible systemic and other adverse effects were recorded after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment and the improvement, compared to baseline, assessed in all included patients. An additional assessment of the safety parameters was carried out at week 2. Parameters of efficacy were the various acne lesion counts, the overall acne severity grade and the calculated totals of acne lesion counts. RESULTS: CTG was statistically significantly more effective than tretinoin at the P = 0.05 level in the papular and the total mean inflammatory lesion counts as well as in the estimated or calculated mean overall acne severity scores. CTG and tretinoin gel were equally effective in the remaining parameters: open and closed comedones, the calculated total mean comedone, the pustule as well as the nodule lesion counts. The onset of action was faster for CTG than for tretinoin gel and evident in all assessed parameters except in open comedone lesion counts. In the calculated total mean acne lesion counts, half of all acne lesions had disappeared by week 6 of treatment with CTG, whereas this was recorded at week 9 for tretinoin gel. No clinically relevant changes in the parameters of safety as a consequence of treatment were observed, although the burning component of irritation was shown to be significantly less for CTG than for tretinoin gel. The observed adverse effects were considered minor. Treatment had to be discontinued in five patients on CTG and three on tretinoin. CONCLUSION: The addition of clindamycin to tretinoin, as in CTG, enhances the comedolytic efficacy of tretinoin in moderate to severe acne of the face, maintaining at the same time its anti-inflammatory efficacy thus accelerating resolution of all types of acne lesions without affecting the safety of response to both components.

"Abstract: The percutaneous absorption of clindamycin was studied in healthy male volunteers, comparing two investigative clindamycin (% w/v)/tretinoin (0.025% w/v) gels, containing clindamycin phosphate ester and clindamycin HCl, respectively, relative to a clindamycin phosphate lotion (1% clindamycin; Dalacin T). Formulations were applied daily for 5 days on the face, according to a balanced complete block design. Redness of the skin was scored visually, and blood and urine were collected. Clindamycin plasma levels did not exceed the limit of quantification (5 ng mL(-1)) with the clindamycin phosphate formulations, but one volunteer who received the clindamycin HCl/tretinoin gel showed plasma levels of up to 13 ng mL(-1). Clindamycin urinary excretion for 12 h after application of the clindamycin phosphate/tretinoin gel was comparable to the values of the reference lotion, whereas the clindamycin HCl/tretinoin gel gave significantly higher values. Erythema appeared to be associated with increased urinary excretion. The formulations were tolerated well. In a separate clinical pilot study in acne patients, the transdermal uptake of tretinoin and clindamycin from the clindamycin phosphate/tretinoin gel was monitored. Plasma samples were collected after 4 and 12 weeks of daily treatment. None of the study plasma samples contained measurable tretinoin levels. Clindamycin levels were not quantifiable in the majority (87%) of samples, the highest plasma level was 11 ng mL(-1). The chemical form of clindamycin proved to modulate skin irritation and percutaneous uptake of clindamycin from a gel formulation in healthy subjects. There was no indications for a notable transdermal uptake of tretinoin during daily application of the gel in patients, nor for an enhancing effect of tretinoin on clindamycin uptake. "

"Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is an alternative method of therapy that can be administered in oral, topical, or injectable forms. It emphasizes the importance of using many herbs that are combined in different formulations for each individual patient. Among some segments of the patient population, it has become increasingly popular as a mode for treating dermatologic diseases. As a result, it is now worthwhile for dermatologists throughout the West to gain some familiarity with this method. Yet, dermatologists are largely unfamiliar with TCM and may possess some misconceptions. We attempt to give a general overview of TCM through the discussion of different clinical studies involving various TCMs. Some proposed mechanisms of action of TCM are also presented. A discussion of adverse effects, including hepatotoxic effects and the need for close monitoring is discussed. A warning regarding the possible contamination of TCMs is also included. Since it is not possible to discuss the application of TCM for every skin disorder, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis are used as the prototype in illustrating the use of TCM. In the future, perhaps a better understanding of TCM will be gained through more systematic analysis and controlled studies with a placebo arm. It is our hope that this article will provide an overview of the efficacy, mechanism of action, as well as adverse effects of TCM. "
"Abstract: Studies have been conducted on the corneal damage by half mustard (2-chloroethyl-ethyl sulfide, CEES) and its possible prevention by a mixture of taurine, alpha-ketoglutarate, pyruvate and pantothenate. CEES has been found to damage the membrane permeability function of the corneal epithelium as evidenced by increased flux of the rubidium ion from the epithelial to the endothelial side. The cornea also loses its transparency. These damaging effects are preventable by the above mixture labeled as VM. It is conceived that use of such a mixed formulation may provide a pharmacological means of prophylactic and post-exposure treatment against the tissue damage caused by exposure to the mustards. "
"Abstract: Anthralin has been a consistently effective drug for the treatment of psoriasis for more than 80 years, but has not enjoyed common use in the United States because of the unwanted side effects of irritation and staining. New treatment methods such as short-contact therapy and innovative vehicle formulations minimizing these problems have allowed anthralin once again to be used effectively in psoriatic treatment programs. We review these newer adaptations and suggest that the enduring modality deserves an important place in the topical armamentarium. "
"Abstract: In order to improve the administration of drugs for all pathology of the oral cavity, we have developed an intraoral controlled release delivering system, permitting to reach high enough local concentrations for desirable therapeutic effect with minimal side effects. We have formulated tablets of 200 mg intended to be fixed on a tooth. These tablets resist food and drink attacks. The tablets we elaborated have a granular matrix composed of hydroxyapatite, ethyl cellulose and Eudragit. Zinc sulfate is used as the first model of an active drug, it has a therapeutic effect on buccal mucous. Profiles of continuous in-vitro drug release in distilled water at 37 degrees C show that zinc sulfate release by the matrix structure for the different tablet formulations is regulated by the proportions of the different components.

"Abstract: The majority of patients with psoriasis exhibit a mild to moderate form of the disease. While topically applied agents represent the ideal therapeutic approach for these patients, our treatment options have been hampered by their inconsistent or limited efficacy, expense, and cosmetic properties. Furthermore, some of the topically applied preparations have the potential for systemic absorption and associated adverse events. Tazarotene is the first synthetically developed retinoid indicated for the topical treatment of patients with psoriasis. Pharmacologically, tazarotene affects the three primary abnormalities associated with psoriasis: it normalizes epidermal differentiation, it exhibits a potent antiproliferative effect, and it decreases epidermal inflammation. Following topical application, tazarotene is rapidly metabolized in the skin to tazarotenic acid, its primary and active metabolite. While tazarotenic acid achieves measurable levels in the systemic circulation, no drug-related hematologic, ophthalmologic, or metabolic adverse events have been observed. Only a minimal amount of tazarotene is absorbed into the circulation. While animal studies have found tazarotene to be nonmutagenic and nonteratogenic, women of child-bearing potential should be counseled regarding the potential risks of retinoid use during pregnancy. In summary, animal and clinical patient trials have found tazarotene to be effective, safe, and well-tolerated. The availability of such an agent in a topical formulation is a welcome treatment alternative for the management of patients with psoriasis. "
"Abstract: How to convert from traditional cyclosporine (CsA) to the microemulsion formulation in stable renal transplant patients is still a matter of debate. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of changeover from traditional Sandimmune to Neoral formulation at two dose-ratio conversions on CsA pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability particularly in terms of renal function. Thirty outpatients regularly followed at our Clinical Research Center were randomized to 1:1 or 1:0.75 dose-ratio conversion and assigned to the two groups according to a comparable renal function and time post-transplant. Patients underwent CsA pharmacokinetic evaluation and renal function measurements (GFR and RPF) before, at day 15, and at month 6 after conversion to Neoral formulation. More consistent CsA concentration-time profiles with Neoral than traditional formulation were obtained at the two time points of evaluation after conversion. At 1:1 dose-ratio conversion an increased absorption rate, reflected by a shorter time to maximum blood CsA concentration (Tmax), and a greater bioavailability, as shown by an increase in the peak CsA concentration (Cmax) and the 12-h exposure to drug defined by the area under the time-concentration curve (AUC0-->12 h) was found 15 d and 6 months after conversion to Neoral formulation. A similar AUC as compared with traditional Sandimmune was observed in those patients randomized to receive a 25% lower dose of Neoral formulation. All of patients defined as 'low' absorbers became 'high' absorbers as early as 15 d after conversion to Neoral formulation at 1:1 or 0.75 dose-ratio regimen. Overall mean GFR was unchanged in both conversion regimens during the 6 months of follow-up. However, there was a tendency to lower GFR even in some patients randomized to 1:0.75 conversion but mostly in those with 1:1 conversion. A limited sampling strategy utilizing three blood samples (0, 1, 3 h post-dosing of Neoral formulation) provided an excellent correlation with actual drug exposure (r = 0.977). Enhanced CsA absorption with the microemulsion formulation results in increased drug exposure that may reduce GFR in some patients who undergo 1:1 dose-ratio conversion. The Neoral formulation that permits a more effective, consistent, and predictable absorption of CsA may represent a great advantage in order to prevent acute and possibly chronic rejections. Efforts have to be made to find optimal therapeutic range and dosing schedule for this new formulation, which may be facilitated by using the limited sampling approach to predict AUC after only three-point sampling.

"Abstract: An audit of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was undertaken in 935 female patients who used morphine patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) for pain relief after major gynaecological operations in a district general hospital. We investigated retrospectively five different antiemetic policies and a reference group without policy from January 1993 to July 1995. The department's computerized audit system was used to analyse the observations. At the beginning of the audit, the incidence of nausea and vomiting was as high as 71.5%. But as a consequence of this audit, a departmental policy was adopted 3 years later, which had an incidence of PONV of only 51.7%. During this time the compliance with antiemetic protocols increased from 41% to 76%. There was significantly less PONV if an antiemetic protocol was followed (P = 0.002). This emphasizes the importance of corporate involvement in the development, formulation and evaluation of departmental protocols if compliance is to be high. We conclude that audit as a corporate effort improves the acceptance of departmental protocols. This reduces PONV significantly irrespective of the type of antiemetic drug used. "
"Abstract: Since the early 1970s, three generations of combination chemotherapy for intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) have been developed. One of the third-generation regimens is MACOP-B (methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin). The VACOP-B regimen is a modification of MACOP-B in which methotrexate is omitted and etoposide is added. This study assesses treatment outcome using the MACOP-B and VACOP-B combination chemotherapy in a population of young patients with intermediate-grade NHL treated in a single tertiary hematological center. The files of 45 patients aged 18-55 who were diagnosed as having intermediate-grade NHL (working formulation types F-H) and treated between January 1986 and March 1994 were reviewed. Treatment response, overall survival, disease-free survival and treatment toxicity were determined. The predictive value of the age-adjusted international prognostic index was also assessed. Median follow-up was 80 months in the MACOP-B group and 29 months in the VACOP-B group. The complete response rate was 71% (95% confidence interval CI: 58-84), 4-year overall survival was 74 +/- 7% and 4-year disease-free survival was 79 +/- 8%. No toxicity-related deaths were observed. The main adverse effects were WHO grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (51%), anemia (24%) and mucositis (20%). Only the CR rate was correlated with the Age-Adjusted International Prognostic Index. Mean relative dose intensity was high (95.7%, 95%) CI: 91.7-99.7) and had no correlation with treatment outcome. The MACOP-B and VACOP-B combination chemotherapy regimens were found to be effective and minimally toxic for young patients up to 55 years old with intermediate-grade NHL. "
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: An estimated 4 million new cases of chlamydial infection occur each year. This experiment assessed the effects of a vaginally applied gel formulation of 0.25% chlorhexidine gluconate on chlamydial infection and on the vaginal ecosystem. STUDY DESIGN: Twelve monkeys were treated with a single application of 0.25% chlorhexidine gluconate. These animals were assessed for changes in vaginal flora before and at 30 minutes, 1 day, and 2 days postapplication by microbiologic analysis. Cervical and vaginal tissues were assessed by colposcopy at each time point. Five monkeys received a single application of 0.25% chlorhexidine gluconate gel followed (30 minutes) by a cervical inoculation with Chlamydia trachomatis. Four monkeys were inoculated with Chlamydia only. Cervicovaginal tissues were assessed via modified colposcopy, vaginal swabs were collected for assessment of vaginal flora, and cervical swabs were collected for detection of Chlamydia (culture/ligase chain reaction) at baseline and days 1, 2, and 7 postinoculation. RESULTS: Changes in vaginal flora were minimal in all monkeys. Application of 0.25% chlorhexidine gluconate did not affect adversely vaginal colonization by lactobacilli. All chlamydial infection control monkeys were infected, whereas none of the five monkeys pretreated with chlorhexidine gluconate were positive for C. trachomatis by culture or ligase chain reaction. Colposcopic observations remained largely unchanged in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: A 0.25% chlorhexidine gluconate gel was protective against chlamydial infection in all animals tested, had no adverse effect on the vaginal flora, and had minimal effect on cervicovaginal tissues after a single application.

"Abstract: Treatment of psoriasis with dithranol as monotherapy or dithranol in combination with UVB phototherapy is an effective and safe approach for the management of psoriasis. Recently a new formulation of dithranol embedded in crystalline monoglycerides (Micanol) has become available. It was shown that this formulation combines adequate efficacy with low irritation and staining properties. The aim of the present study was to compare and contrast three treatment schedules with respect to clinical efficacy and tolerability: Micanol monotherapy, Micanol in combination with UVB phototherapy and placebo combined with UVB phototherapy. The study design was a partly open, partly double-blind, randomized, left-right comparison. In total 36 patients were included and 24 body halves were available for each of the three treatments. The combination of Micanol with UVB resulted in clearance of lesions in 54% of the patients (body halves). Combination therapies with Micanol and either of the two other therapies were highly effective. However, with the number of patients investigated, a statistically significant difference between the three therapeutic approaches with respect to efficacy could not be shown. The three treatments resulted in a grosso modo comparable clinical improvement. Severe irritation was observed in 8% and staining of the skin in 29% of the patients treated with the combination therapy Micanol/UVB, which is far less compared to the irritation and staining by the conventional short contact approaches. The efficacy and tolerability of Micanol make this active substance an important tool in the management of psoriasis. "
"BACKGROUND: Users of cosmetics and skin care products often report adverse reactions ranging from itching and dryness to intense inflammatory responses such as erythema or wheal and rash. Self-assessment is not always an accurate parameter for categorizing skin as sensitive or nonsensitive, although it can be valuable. For this reason, it is important to define sensitive skin by more objective factors. OBJECTIVE: Studies were undertaken to determine if objective biophysical measurements could detect differences in barrier function between those individuals who identified themselves as having sensitive skin and those self-identified as having normal skin. In addition, the effects of treatment on barrier functions of individuals with sensitive skin were determined. METHODS: Three main factors that contribute to cutaneous reactivities were observed for the estimation of skin sensitivity: barrier functions, reactivity to irritants, and neuronal responses manifested as sensory reactions. Barrier functions of the skin was tested by gentle removal of the stratum corneum with simple cellophane tape stripping followed by measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) as a marker of barrier loss. The onset and intensity of skin reaction against an irritant, balsam of Peru, was tested on the same individuals to observe the reactivity of their skin. Using the lactic acid sting test, additional information regarding skin sensitivities was obtained. RESULTS: Sensitive skin individuals exhibiting easy barrier damage possess delicate skin that is also highly reactive to irritants. When these individuals used a regimen of products that contained minimal preservatives and no surfactants for 8 weeks, the skin barrier and reactivity changed such that it was similar to nonsensitive skin. CONCLUSIONS: Skin sensitivity is observed because of a combination of factors, including a disrupted barrier and a tendency to hyperreact to topical agents. Treatment with special topical skin care formulations can reduce overall skin sensitivity. "
"BACKGROUND: There currently is no agreement regarding the appropriate treatment of elderly patients with advanced breast carcinoma (ABC). Doxifluridine (5-dFUR), a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil, has been found to be effective in this entity, but its use is limited by neurotoxicity and cardiotoxicity that are not observed when the oral formulation is used. The objective of this Phase II trial was to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of oral 5-dFUR, biomodulated with levoleucovorin (1-leucovorin), in elderly patients (age > 70 years) with ABC. METHODS: 5-dFUR was administered orally at 600 mg/m2 twice daily for 4 consecutive days every 12 days, and oral 1-leucovorin was administered as 25 mg 2 hours before each 5-dFUR administration. Response was assessed every five cycles according to the World Health Organization criteria. In the presence of response or stable disease, the patients were treated for a maximum of 15 cycles. RESULTS: Seventy-three eligible patients were enrolled, 27 of whom had been pretreated with chemotherapy and/or hormonotherapy; all were assessable for response and toxicity after a median follow-up of 15 months. The objective response rate was 26% (95% confidence interval, 17.4-45.4). Regression predominantly occurred in the presence of soft tissue involvement (skin, lymph nodes, and breast). The median time to response was 2 months (range, 1-2 months) and the median response duration was 7 months (range, 2-17+ months). The median survival was 24 months (range, 2-42+ months). The treatment was very well tolerated, and the side effects were manageable and always reversible. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study show that 5-dFUR plus 1-leucovorin, both given orally, are associated with excellent patient compliance. Although the results are suboptimal in terms of an objective response, this characteristic could allow 5-dFUR to be used in elderly patients considered unsuitable for ""aggressive"" chemotherapy. "
"BACKGROUND: The new oral microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine (Neoral) possesses superior pharmacokinetics to the conventional formulation, Sandimmun (SIM), providing more complete and predictable absorption, and less pharmacokinetic variability. METHODS: The safety and tolerability of Neoral, together with the incidence of acute rejection episodes and graft survival, were compared to the conventional cyclosporine formulation, SIM, in a prospective, randomized, double-blind multicenter trial. A total of 167 patients who received a first or second cadaveric renal transplant in 21 participating centers in six countries were randomized equally to two treatment groups and followed for three months after transplantation. Outcomes were analyzed across treatment, center and regional groups. In addition, a nested pharmacokinetic study was performed in four of these centers throughout the period of follow-up. RESULTS: No difference was detected between the safety or tolerability of the two formulations. Kidney function and other laboratory parameters remained comparable in Neoral- and SIM-treated patients throughout the study. However, the number of patients experiencing acute rejection was significantly reduced for the Neoral group (44.2% vs. 60.5%; P = 0.044), and significantly fewer patients experienced multiple episodes of rejection (12.8% vs. 22.2%, P = 0.028). The proportion of patients free of rejection at three months was significantly higher in patients treated with Neoral than in those receiving SIM (Kaplan-Meier estimated probability of remaining rejection-free at 3 months = 55% for the Neoral group, compared with 39% for the SIM group, P = 0.046, log rank test). Similar results were obtained when acute rejection, graft loss and death were used as a combined endpoint (Kaplan-Meier estimated probability for Neoral group = 54%, compared with 38% for the SIM group, P = 0.047, log rank test). Comparison of results by center or regional groups did not show any significant treatment interaction. A nested pharmacokinetic evaluation (four centers; 28 subjects) showed that the bioavailability of cyclosporine from Neoral was significantly higher than from SIM at all assessment times. Specifically, at weeks 2, 4 to 6, and 12, dose-normalized AUC was 49%, 63% and 32% higher for Neoral. Dose-normalized peak cyclosporine blood concentrations and AUC stabilized by weeks 4 to 6 in patients receiving Neoral, whereas these values increased slowly in SIM-treated patients without reaching the levels achieved in the Neoral group. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the superior pharmacokinetic characteristics of the microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine lead to more efficient immunosuppression during the first critical months after transplantation, without a deleterious impact on clinical safety. "
"Abstract: Neoral is a new formulation of cyclosporine based on microemulsion technology, designed to provide increased and more reliable absorption of the medication. The aim of this study was to assess whether conversion from Sandimmune to Neoral provides safe and effective oral immunosuppression in stable liver transplant recipients. We studied 59 stable liver transplant recipients (being treated with prednisone, azathioprine, and Sandimmune). All patients were enrolled in an open-label study in which they were converted from Sandimmune to Neoral therapy at a dose ratio of 1:1. Thirty-nine patients underwent duct-to-duct bile duct anastomoses, and 20 underwent Roux-en-Y bile duct anastomoses. After conversion, the Neoral dosage was adjusted on the basis of trough levels measured at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12. To assess safety and tolerability, we prospectively obtained serial information, including laboratory data and information on side effects. Standard statistical methodology was used. A total of 59 patients (23 men, 36 women; mean age, 55 years; mean follow-up after liver transplantation, 5.7 years) completed 3 months of follow-up after conversion from Sandimmune to Neoral. There were 32 dosage changes; 22 (69%) required reduction of the Neoral dose. Mean cyclosporine trough levels remained above 100 ng/mL during the follow-up period. There were no significant differences between cyclosporine levels in patients with duct-to-duct or Roux-en-Y bile duct anastomoses. There were no episodes of rejection during the 3-month follow-up period. The side effect profile was similar in both groups, except for a significant reduction in the number of patients with headaches after Neoral conversion. Liver transplant recipients can safely be converted from Sandimmune to Neoral. Neoral was well tolerated in this population. "

"BACKGROUND: Sandimmun Neoral is a microemulsion formulation of Sandimmun cyclosporin (Cya) with predictable pharmacokinetics, superior absorption and less dependent upon bile production. Recently Neoral replaced the old Cya in the clinical ground. METHODS: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness, safety and advantages of this conversion in 90 adult renal transplant patients with stable renal function transplanted at least 24 months earlier. There were 48 males and 42 females with a mean age of 39 years (range: 18-56). Mean interval from transplant to conversion was 3.6 years (range: 2.7-5.4). Conversion rate was 1:1. Mean Neoral dose at conversion was 3.8 mg/kg/day (range: 2.1-5.7). RESULTS: One month after conversion mean Neoral dose was 3.4 mg/kg/day (range: 2.2-3.9) and at six months was 3.2 mg/kg/day (range: 2.1-4). Serum creatinine and CyA trough levels remained stable. We did not observe rejection episodes or infections. The incidence of side effects due to CyA was slightly increased and there were not differences in terms of arterial pressure values and number of antihypertensive drugs given. CONCLUSIONS: The conclusion is drown that conversion to Neoral is safe and results in rapid attainment of therapeutic trough levels. Six months after conversion the mean Neoral dose was decreased of 0.6 mg/kg/die per patient. "
"Abstract: In connection with a national cost-effective evaluation study of short contact dithranol therapy for psoriasis, the question arose whether dithranol cream irritation is influenced by constituents of the vehicle. To establish the role of the different components of the vehicle in the mechanism of dithranol irritation, the dithranol 3% cream used in the evaluation study and its vehicle with nine different combinations of its components were tested in a blind study. The creams were applied for 15, 30 and 45 min on the backs of 12 healthy volunteers. Irritation was scored as erythema by visual and colorimeter scoring. The dithranol creams with salicylic acid among their stabilizers showed 42% more irritation than the dithranol creams with only sorbic acid or no stabilizers at all. Stability tests showed no significant degradation of dithranol in the two less irritating creams when kept at 4 degrees C for 11 months. Salicylic acid in the cream aggravates dithranol-induced erythema. "
"Abstract: Hydroquinone (HQ) is used in over-the-counter formulations of skin-lightening creams sold in the United States and European Union. HQ was introduced into these formulations to provide a safe and effective alternative to mercury and other less effective ingredients. Recent studies involving subchronic oral exposure of male F344 rats to HQ have shown nephrotoxicity and renal tubule cell proliferation (English et al., 1994), while chronic exposures of male F344 rats were reported to cause renal cell adenomas (NTP, 1989). Previous subchronic dermal toxicity studies (CTFA, 1986; NTP, 1989) with HQ failed to detect nephrotoxicity; however, these studies were not specifically designed to assess renal structure and function. More sensitive endpoints were used in the present subchronic study to address concerns over potential toxicity from repeated dermal exposure to HQ. Male and female F344 rats were given topical applications with 0, 2.0, 3.5, or 5.0% HQ in an oil-in-water emulsion cream for 13 wk (5 days/wk). Body weights, feed consumption and water consumption were monitored, and animals were observed for clinical signs of toxicity and dermal irritation. Blood taken at termination was analysed for haematological and clinical chemistry effects. Erythema, which abated when exposure stopped, was the only dermatological effect seen at the HQ-cream application sites. Cell proliferation in the kidneys was evaluated after 3, 6 and 13 wk of treatment using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labelling, but no changes indicative of sustained cell proliferation were seen. The renal histopathological lesions noted after oral exposure to HQ were not present after dermal exposure. Thus, topical exposure to HQ does not result in the renal toxicity observed in previous studies with F344 rats given HQ orally. "
"BACKGROUND: A microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine, Neoral, has been developed to overcome the problems associated with the poor and variable absorption of the traditional oil-based oral formulation, Sandimmune. The present study was conducted to compare the safety and tolerability of Neoral versus Sandimmune in maintenance renal transplant recipients over 1 year, and to assess the number of dose adjustments necessary to maintain trough cyclosporine concentrations within the desired therapeutic range. METHODS. Patients on Sandimmune were randomized to be converted to Neoral (n=373) or remain on Sandimmune (n=93) for 12 months. RESULTS: The proportion of patients needing dose increases to maintain cyclosporine trough levels within the desired range was significantly higher in the Sandimmune group during the first 3 months of the study, whereas the number of patients needing dose reductions was similar in both groups throughout the study period. There were no differences between the groups in terms of changes in blood pressure, serum creatinine levels, or other laboratory parameters. No significant differences in the incidence of adverse events known to be related to cyclosporine were observed between the treatment groups. More adverse events were causally related to Neoral than to Sandimmune by the investigators. However, overall, there were no clinically relevant differences between the treatment groups in the main safety and tolerability variables. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study in maintenance renal transplant patients suggest that the improved pharmacokinetic characteristics of the microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine, Neoral, may facilitate the clinical management of cyclosporine immunosuppression, compared with the traditional formulation, Sandimmune. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the average improved bioavailability of Neoral has a negative impact on the main safety and tolerability variables, as no significant differences in graft function, the incidence of rejections, and most adverse events were seen. "
"BACKGROUND: Although Hamamelis virginiana has long been used in the traditional treatment of skin diseases, there are few controlled clinical studies defining the extent of its anti-inflammatory action. OBJECTIVE: The anti-inflammatory efficacy of pH5 Eucerin aftersun lotion with 10% hamamelis distillate, the vehicle and a prior aftersun formulation were tested in 30 healthy volunteers using a modified UVB erythema test as model of inflammation. METHODS: Four UVB doses ranging from 1 to 2 MED were evaluated in each subject. Test fields on the back were treated occlusively for 48 h following irradiation. Chromametry and visual scoring were used to determine the degree of erythema in the treated fields and an untreated, irradiated control field 7, 24 and 48 h after irradiation. RESULTS: Erythema suppression ranged from approximately 20% of 7 h to 27% at 48 h in the hamamelis fields. A suppression of 11-15% was recorded in the fields treated with the other lotions. Significant differences were noted between hamamelis and these lotions. CONCLUSION: These data provide evidence for an anti-inflammatory action of the aftersun lotion with 10% hamamelis and support the usefulness of the UVB erythema test with multiple UV doses for the testing of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.

"Abstract: In this study we aimed at evaluating the modifications in the pharmacokinetic profile of cyclosporin A (CyA) after conversion from standard formulation (CyA-ST) to a new formulation (CyA-NF, Sandimmun Neoral) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It was an open, crossover study that involved 15 RA patients who were on stabilized treatment with CyA-ST. The patient continued receiving CyA-ST (mean dose of 3.0 +/- 0.7 mg/kg per day) for 3 weeks and then converted 1:1 to CyA-NF for a further 3 weeks. CyA pharmacokinetics were established on day 1 (CyA-ST evaluation) and +21 (CyA-NF evaluation). The results showed that the bioavailability of CyA-NF was greater than that of CyA-ST (AUC tau, bss: 3335 +/- 1300 vs 2667 +/- 1155 ng.h/ml, P = 0.0073; AUC tau, bss ratio 1.26 +/- 0.40 vs 1.0 as reference, P < 0.05), with higher and earlier peak blood concentrations (Cmax: 677 +/- 256 vs 475 +/- 213 ng/ml, P = 0.0329; tmax: 1.5 +/- 0.7 vs 2.6 +/- 1.6 h, P = 0.0720). The pharmacokinetic profile of CyA-NF showed greater between-patient reproducibility (lower CV% for all of the considered parameters). In conclusion, when using CyA-NF instead of CyA-ST, greater and more constant exposure to CyA should be expected. "
"Abstract: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of an extended-release formulation of a classical antihistamine, brompheniramine, and a second-generation compound, loratadine, in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Subjects with symptoms of allergic rhinitis received brompheniramine 12 mg twice daily (n = 112), loratadine 10 mg once daily (n = 112), or placebo twice daily (n = 114) for 7 days. Study medications were blinded using a double-dummy technique. Subjects completed an overall evaluation of symptom relief on a daily basis and returned on treatment days 3 and 7, at which times the investigator assessed symptom severity. The investigator and subject each completed a global efficacy evaluation, and subjects were interviewed regarding adverse experiences. The primary efficacy variable was the physicians' global efficacy evaluation on day 3. Symptoms also were analyzed as summed severity scores for all symptoms and for the nasal symptom cluster of rhinorrhea, sneezing, and nasal blockage. At all post-baseline evaluations (days 3, 7, and averaged over the two days), brompheniramine was significantly better than loratadine and placebo for both sets of summed symptom scores and all three global assessments. Loratadine was significantly better than placebo for physician ratings of total symptom severity averaged over the two days and for the physician and subject ratings of the nasal cluster on day 3. Central nervous system-related symptoms were the most frequently reported adverse experiences; somnolence was reported most frequently by patients taking brompheniramine, and its occurrence was less frequent as treatment continued. A nonprescription, extended-release formulation of brompheniramine 12 mg twice daily provided significantly better relief of symptomatic allergic rhinitis than loratadine 10 mg once daily. "
"BACKGROUND: Neoral is a microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine that has a better pharmacokinetic profile than the standard formulation (Sandimmune). To prove the safety of converting stable liver transplant patients from Sandimmune to Neoral, we conducted a prospective trial involving 54 patients. METHOD: The average time from transplantation to conversion was 48.5+/-21.6 months. Thirty of 54 patients (55%) required a dose reduction during the study for various reasons. Five of 30 patients had the first dose reduction because of increased levels of cyclosporine. Seven patients required more than one dose reduction. RESULTS: Sixteen patients suffered serious adverse events. Six patients had a biopsy-proven rejection. Four of 6 patients had trough cyclosporine levels within 20% of baseline value immediately before developing rejection. CONCLUSION: Converting patients from the standard formulation to the microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine seems to expose stable patients to unnecessary risks. "
"Abstract: Cyclosporin A (CsA) was introduced in recent years for the treatment of lupus nephritis in patients with steroid resistance or in those with severe corticosteroid toxicity. Our previous study on paediatric patients showed that Neoral (a new microemulsion formulation) had better bioavailability than CsA capsules. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of Neoral in children with lupus nephritis compared with conventional therapy, we performed an open randomized study on 40 children, ranging from 9 to 14 yr old, with class III-V lupus nephritis and heavy proteinuria. They were randomly assigned to either Neoral (5 mg/kg/day), administered q.12.h, or prednisolone (2 mg/kg/day) plus cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day) for 1 yr. Both groups showed a significant decrease in proteinuria (Neoral: 4.62 +/- 1.93 to 0.35 +/- 0.29 g/day, P < 0.05; prednisolone plus cyclophosphamide: 4.52 +/- 1.86 to 0.62 +/- 0.21 g/day, P < 0.01). The CH50 haemolytic assay titre decreased after 1 yr of Neoral treatment (26.5 +/- 0.9 to 21.4 +/- 2.2 U/ml, P < 0.05). Serum C3 and anti-double-stranded (ds) DNA antibody levels also fell with Neoral (C3: 86.2 +/- 6.8 to 76.3 +/- 4.5 mg/dl; anti-ds DNA antibodies: 14.1 +/- 3.2 to 8.2 +/- 1.4 IU/ml, P < 0.05). The Neoral group had a significant increase in growth rate over the prednisolone plus cyclophosphamide group (8.2 +/- 1.1 cm/yr vs 2.7 +/- 0.6 cm/yr, P < 0.01) with improvement of growth status. During the study period, patients tolerated Neoral well with no significant changes in renal function, liver function or lipid profile. Our study implies that Neoral appears to be effective in suppressing proteinuria. Neoral should be regarded as being adjunctive therapy, perhaps with a steroid-sparing effect, in paediatric lupus nephritis. However, its long-term use awaits further studies. "
"OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a new cyclosporin A (CyA) microemulsion formulation, Sandimmun Neoral (Neoral), in patients with severe psoriasis that was stable on CyA administered as Sandimmun (SIM). METHODS: In this 24-week, open, randomized, prospective, multicentre trial, 28 patients continued on the same dosage of SIM, while 30 converted to Neoral at 2.5 mg/kg/day or a dosage equivalent to their pre-conversion SIM dosage. During the study, dosages could be adjusted to maintain efficacy, because of adverse events or after disease stabilization. The maximum permitted dosage for either formulation was 5.0 mg/kg/day. Primary efficacy criteria were change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) from baseline and time to relapse. RESULTS: The dosage was increased to maintain efficacy in 22 patients (Neoral 13; SIM 9) and 20 dose reductions for safety were required (Neoral 14, SIM 6). In both groups, PASI scores remained stable throughout and relapses were primarily a result of dosage reduction after disease stabilization. No significant difference was found between groups in the proportion of patients remaining relapse-free. Adverse events were recorded in 20 patients receiving Neoral and 14 receiving SIM. Most drug-related events were of mild or moderate severity and reflected the known CyA side-effect profile. Dose titration guidelines ensured that mean blood pressure and serum creatinine concentrations remained stable in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: If the guidelines for CyA use are followed and the Neoral dosage does not exceed 5 mg/kg/day, conversion of stable patients with severe psoriasis from SIM to Neoral should present no clinically relevant safety or tolerability problems and efficacy of treatment is maintained.

"BACKGROUND: The addition of polyolprepolymer-2 in tretinoin formulations may reduce tretinoin-induced cutaneous irritation. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the efficacy and safety of a new 0.025% tretinoin gel containing polyolprepolymer-2, its vehicle, and a commercially-available 0.025% tretinoin gel in patients with mild to moderate acne vulgaris. METHODS: In this 12-week multicenter, double-blind, parallel group study, efficacy was evaluated by objective lesion counts and the investigators' global evaluations. Subjective assessment of cutaneous irritation by the investigators and patients evaluated safety. RESULTS: The efficacy of the two active treatments in this 215 patient study was comparable, and both treatments were statistically significantly more effective than vehicle. When compared with the commercially-available tretinoin gel, the formulation containing polyolprepolymer-2 demonstrated statistically significantly less peeling at days 28, 56, and 84, statistically significantly less dryness by day 84, and statistically significantly less itching at day 14. Irritation scores for the formulation containing polyolprepolymer-2 were numerically lower but not statistically different from those of the commercially-available gel for erythema and burning. The number of cutaneous and noncutaneous adverse events were similar for both active medications. CONCLUSION: The two 0.025% gels studied demonstrated comparable efficacy. However, the gel formulation containing polyolprepolymer-2 caused significantly less peeling and drying than the commercially-available formulation by day 84 of the study. "
"BACKGROUND: A novel tretinoin preparation uses polyolprepolymer-2, a compound designed to reduce skin irritation by helping retain drugs on and in the surface layers of the skin. OBJECTIVE: We used patch testing to measure the effect of polyolprepolymer-2 on tretinoin-associated irritation. METHODS: Two patch test studies were conducted. The first assessed the effect of polyolprepolymer-2 by comparing commercially-available tretinoin formulations with respective polyolprepolymer-containing formulations of 0.025% tretinoin gel and 0.025%, 0.05%, and 0.1% tretinoin creams. The second assessed the effect of the polyolprepolymer-2 concentration on the potential decrease in irritation by comparing: (1) a commercially-available tretinoin cream with prototype tretinoin creams containing 20% polyolprepolymer-2 at three different concentrations of tretinoin (0.025%, 0.05%, and 0.1%); and (2) the effect of three different polyolprepolymer-2 concentrations (10%, 15%, and 20%) in prototype tretinoin creams on cumulative irritation. Patch agents were assigned to subjects according to a randomization schedule, and during a period of 5 days each subject received three 24-hour exposures to the test materials. Twenty-four hours elapsed between old patch removal and new patch application. RESULTS: In the first study, the tretinoin gel and cream containing polyolprepolymer-2 caused significantly less irritation than all equivalent formulations of the commercially-available tretinoin gel and creams except the 0.025% cream formulation. Irritation scores were not significantly different in terms of irritation in the 0.025% creams although scores did indicate a trend towards lower irritation with 0.025% tretinoin cream containing polyolprepolymer-2. In the second study, the tretinoin gel containing polyolprepolymer-2 and the three tretinoin prototype creams also containing polyolprepolymer-2 caused significantly less irritation than comparable concentrations of the commercially-available tretinoin. In addition, the 0.025% tretinoin gel formulation containing polyolprepolymer-2 was no more irritating than the commercially-available 0.025% tretinoin cream. CONCLUSION: Tretinoin formulations containing polyolprepolymer-2 are, in general, less irritating than the currently marketed tretinoin formulations. "
"Abstract: Novel tretinoin cream and gel formulations have been developed that incorporate polyolprepolymer-2, which is a material designed to help retain drug molecules in and on the skin when applied in topical vehicles. The results of preclinical and clinical investigations have confirmed the beneficial impact of such a vehicle on tretinoin tolerability. In vitro studies with selected polyolprepolymer-containing formulations have reduced initial and cumulative tretinoin percutaneous penetration, and guinea pig studies showed that the gel formulation containing polyolprepolymer-2 caused less erythema and edema than did the corresponding commercially-available tretinoin gel formulation. Human studies with tretinoin containing polyolprepolymer-2 have consistently demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile when compared with commercially-available tretinoin. Use of the polyolprepolymer-2-containing tretinoin formulation in human studies has resulted in reductions in peeling--a problem commonly associated with use of standard tretinoin formulations. These reductions in irritation have not been at the expense of efficacy; acne clinical trial results indicate comparable effectiveness between tretinoin containing polyolprepolymer2 and commercially-available tretinoin.

"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the relative bioavailability of two 16-mg extemporaneously prepared suppository formulations with that of an 8-mg commercially available oral tablet. DESIGN: Prospective, crossover bioavailability study. SETTING: Inpatient clinical research center. SUBJECTS: Sixteen young, nonsmoking, healthy volunteers. INTERVENTIONS: Blood samples were obtained 24 and 48 hours after administration of an 8-mg oral ondansetron tablet and 16-mg suppository, respectively. Two 16-mg suppository formulations were compounded using commercially available Fattibase and Polybase. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Ondansetron was well absorbed by both routes of administration. The following pharmacokinetic parameters (mean+/-SEM) were obtained for the 8-mg tablet, 16-mg Fattibase suppository, and 16-mg Polybase suppository, respectively: area under the curve (AUC) in men 154.2+/-21.77, 253.4+/-72.3, 304.8+/-62.2 ng x hr/ml; AUC in women 353.6+/-32.7, 561.6+/-103.6, and 768.7+/-117.9 ng x hr/ml; maximum concentration (Cmax) in men 45.5+/-7.0, 40.6+/-10.4, and 51.2+/-6.7 ng/ml; Cmax in women 51.4+/-.8, 47.1+/-3.9, and 82.9+/-6.6 ng/ml. Times to Cmax (Tmax; mean+/-SEM) for men were 1.5+/-0.3, 4.4+/-0.5, and 2.9+/-0.3 hours; Tmax for women were 1.8+/-0.3, 4.1+/-0.4, and 4.4+/-0.6 hours for the three formulations, respectively. Women had a consistently higher AUC for all three formulations than men (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: With the exception of the 16-mg Polybase formulation in women, the two suppositories closely approximated the pharmacokinetics of the 8-mg oral tablet. These results suggest that gender may be a significant factor in ondansetron's disposition. "
"BACKGROUND: Patients presenting with acetaminophen toxicity and vomiting are often treated with antiemetics so that orally administered N-acetylcysteine can be retained. The policy at the West Virginia Poison Center is to reserve ondansetron, an antiemetic with a higher cost than other antiemetics, as a second line agent for patients presenting within 8 hours of an acetaminophen ingestion. METHODS: A retrospective study of cases between January 1993 and December 1995, in which the primary or secondary drug ingested was an adult-strength, acetaminophen-only formulation and the ingestion resulted in vomiting. Seventy-eight patients with laboratory-verified acetaminophen toxicity and vomiting were evaluated for the type of antiemetics used and the antiemetic's effectiveness. RESULTS: Of the 78 acetaminophen toxic patients with vomiting, 17/51 patients (33.3%) who received a nonondansetron antiemetic failed therapy and required IV ondansetron. Of the 24 patients who received ondansetron, 4 patients (16.7%) failed therapy. All four patients who failed ondansetron therapy had previously failed other antiemetic therapy. DISCUSSION: Although ondansetron had a lower failure rate than nonondansetron antiemetics, almost two-thirds of acetaminophen toxic patients with vomiting did not require ondansetron to control their vomiting. Health care costs would have been higher had these patients received ondansetron as their initial therapy. Antiemetics were found to be highly effective as only 3/78 patients (4%) required IV N-acetylcysteine secondary to antiemetic failure. CONCLUSIONS: Ondansetron should be utilized as a second-line agent in the management of acetaminophen toxic patients with vomiting. Because of its lower failure rate, ondansetron should be administered as a first-line agent in patients with a delay in N-acetylcysteine administration approaching 8 or more hours. "
"BACKGROUND: Postoperative erythema of several months duration is a universal and problematic side effect of cutaneous carbon dioxide (CO2) laser resurfacing. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted in order to determine the effectiveness of two formulations of topical ascorbic acid in reducing the degree and duration of post-CO2 laser resurfacing erythema. RESULTS: The application of topical L-ascorbic acid in an aqueous formulation resulted in a significant decrease in post-CO2 laser resurfacing erythema by the eighth postoperative week when compared with laser-irradiated skin that had not received topical vitamin C. The application of topical ascorbic acid in a cream formulation did not result in a significant reduction in post-CO2 laser resurfacing erythema. CONCLUSION: Topical L-ascorbic acid, when used in an appropriate vehicle and when initiated at an appropriate postoperative period, may decrease the degree and duration of erythema after cutaneous CO2 laser resurfacing. It is presumed that the anti-inflammatory effect of vitamin C is responsible for the clinical changes observed in this study. "
"BACKGROUND: Hypersensitivity reactions to cyclosporine are rare. The mechanism of the reaction and guidelines for subsequent use of cyclosporine are not well defined. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanisms involved in hypersensitivity reactions to cyclosporine and determine the feasibility of future cyclosporine use. METHODS: We report a patient who had an anaphylactic reaction during the intravenous infusion of cyclosporine. Skin-prick tests were performed for the antibiotics he received earlier in the day and the cyclosporine. A MEDLINE search identified all the reported cases of hypersensitivity reactions to cyclosporine. Each was analyzed to determine a mechanism of the hypersensitivity reaction and subsequent management outcomes. RESULTS: Intradermal tests to intravenous cyclosporine formulation (1 mg/mL) were positive in the patient and negative in two controls. There was no reaction to the antibiotics. The literature search revealed 22 cases of hypersensitivity reaction to cyclosporine. The clinical setting and diagnostic evaluation suggest multiple mechanisms for the hypersensitivity response. All seven patients who were given an oral formulation of cyclosporine tolerated it well after a reaction to the intravenous infusion. Two patients who initially reacted to an oral solution formulation subsequently tolerated the corn oil-based soft gelatin capsule. CONCLUSIONS: Hypersensitivity reactions to cyclosporine are due to Cremophor EL. There is direct and indirect evidence for various immunologic and nonimmunologic pathways precipitating the reaction. This case suggests a role for IgE in the hypersensitivity reaction. Fortunately, a hypersensitivity reaction to one formulation of cyclosporine does not preclude use of a different formulation. The corn oil-based soft gelatin capsule appears to be the safest formulation. "
"Abstract: Facial skin resurfacing using the carbon dioxide laser has become an increasingly popular procedure. Improvements in carbon dioxide laser technology have made the procedure simpler and more reliable. However, difficulties and problems in the postoperative period can lead to patient morbidity and physician anxiety. The authors have performed laser resurfacing in almost 2,000 patients in the last 4 years. Problems encountered and methods formulated to minimize postoperative complications are discussed. "
"Abstract: Mometasone, a synthetic 16 alpha-methyl analogue of beclomethasone, is classified as a 'potent' glucocorticoid for dermatological use. It is available as 0.1% cream, ointment and lotion formulations for the treatment of patients with inflammatory glucocorticoid-responsive dermatoses. In patients with atopic dermatitis, the effect of mometasone 0.1% applied once daily over 2 to 3 weeks were similar to those of other glucocorticoids of similar potency, such as betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% twice daily and methylprednisolone aceponate 0.1% once daily. Mometasone 0.1% was significantly superior to twice-daily application of less potent glucocorticoids such as clobetasone 0.05%, hydrocortisone 1.0%, hydrocortisone butyrate and hydrocortisone valerate 0.2%. In patients with seborrhoeic dermatitis, mometasone 0.1% was more effective than ketoconazole 2.0% and hydrocortisone 1.0% in trials lasting 4 or 6 weeks. In the management of scalp psoriasis and psoriasis vulgaris, mometasone 0.1% applied once daily for 2 to 8 weeks was generally more effective than other glucocorticoids of similar or weaker potency such as betamethasone valerate 0.1%, fluocinolone acetonide 0.025%, fluticasone propionate 0.005%, triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% and hydrocortisone 1.0% and as effective as diflucortolone valerate 0.1%. Alternate day application of mometasone 0.1% for 2 weeks was as effective as once-daily application in maintaining symptom control in a small number of patients with psoriasis vulgaris. Although mometasone demonstrates greater anti-inflammatory activity and a longer duration of action than betamethasone, it has low potential to cause adverse systemic effects such as suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Moreover, its atrophogenic potential is low and no greater than that of other glucocorticoids in its class, such as betamethasone valerate. Transient, mild to moderate, local adverse effects such as burning, stinging, folliculitis, dryness, acneiform eruptions and signs of skin atrophy have been reported with mometasone. Mometasone has shown a low risk of primary sensitisation and cross-reactions in preliminary patch test studies. Mometasone is a well tolerated topical glucocorticoid effective in the management of patients with atopic dermatitis, seborrhoeic dermatitis, scalp psoriasis and psoriasis vulgaris. In addition to its low potential for causing primary sensitisation and cross-reactions with other topical glucocorticoids, mometasone offers the convenience of once-daily administration. "
"OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of a new gel formulation of podofilox in the treatment of anogenital warts. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, multicenter, vehicle-controlled investigation. SETTING: Private dermatology practices, university clinics (dermatology, gynecology, and infectious diseases), and contract research organizations. PATIENTS: Three hundred twenty-six patients with anogenital warts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Number of patients with clearing of all treated warts (treatment success). RESULTS: The 0.5% podofilox gel was significantly better than vehicle gel for successfully eliminating and reducing the number and size of anogenital warts. In the intent-to-treat population, 62 (37.1%) of 167 patients treated with 0.5% podofilox gel had complete clearing of the treated areas (treatment successes) compared with 2 (2.3%) of 86 patients who had clearing of warts with the vehicle gel (P < .001) after 4 weeks. Nineteen additional patients treated with 0.5% podofilox gel and 2 patients treated with vehicle gel had clearing of warts with continued treatment up to 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, 35.9% of the baseline anogenital warts treated with 0.5% podofilox gel remained; this was significantly fewer than in the vehicle-treated group (88.4% of the baseline number) (P = .001). The 0.5% podofilox gel was generally well tolerated, with predominantly mild or moderate local adverse reactions occurring in the majority of patients. Only 7 patients (3.2%), all receiving 0.5% podofilox gel, discontinued study treatment because of drug-related local reactions. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that 0.5% podofilox gel is safe and significantly more effective than vehicle gel in the treatment of anogenital warts. "
"Abstract: The potential use of terpenes/terpenoids as penetration enhancers in the transdermal delivery of propranolol hydrochloride (PL) was investigated. PL was chosen for the reasons of its extensive first-pass metabolism and short elimination half-life. The terpenes studied included L-menthol, (+)-limonene, (+/-)-linalool, and carvacrol at 1%, 5%, and 10% w/v concentrations. The diffusion of PL across excised hairless mouse skin was determined using side-by-side diffusion cells. Flux, permeability coefficient (Pm), and lag time (tL) were calculated. PL showed comparable lag times with menthol at all three concentration levels. At a 1% level of carvacrol, PL exhibited a 2.4- and 2.2-fold increase in lag time compared with 5 and 10% levels of enhancer, respectively. In the presence of limonene, PL had shown maximum lag time (between 3.0 and 3.3 h) at all three levels. In the case of linalool, the lag times for PL with 5 and 10% levels of enhancer were 7.0- and 5.2-fold less compared with 1% level. A significant (p < 0.05) concentration effect was observed only with linalool. Hydrogel-based patches were formulated with or without menthol as enhancer. Release profiles from the hydrogel formulations obeyed zero-order kinetics. The permeability of propranolol was significantly higher (p < 0.05) from the test patch than the control (no enhancer) patch across the mouse skin. The mechanism of permeation enhancement of menthol could involve its distribution preferentially into the intercellular spaces of stratum corneum and the possible reversible disruption of the intercellular lipid domain. The results suggest the potential use of menthol as effective penetration enhancer in the delivery of significant amounts of PL through skin. "
"BACKGROUND: Historically, the acute rejection rates in simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) recipients have been extremely high (50-80%), with many second and third rejection episodes despite the use of quadruple immunosuppression (antibody induction and cyclosporine [CsA]-azathioprine [AZA]-based maintenance immunosuppression). Although this acute rejection has rarely led to graft loss, it has been a great cause of morbidity and of significantly increased cost. In an attempt to decrease the acute rejection rate and related morbidity in SPK transplant recipients, we compared two ""state-of-the-art"" immunosuppression regimens in a prospective, randomized, single-center study. METHODS: Patients who received SPK transplants were randomized to receive either tacrolimus (TAC) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, n=18) or CsA (Neoral formulation) and MMF (n=18). All patients received OKT3 induction and prednisone, which was tapered to 5 mg/day by 6 months after transplantation. All rejection episodes were biopsy proven. In addition, metabolic control (HgbA1C, hypertension, serum cholesterol), drug toxicity, and infection also were measured. Data were compared with that of a historical group (n=18) who received conventional CsA (Sandimmune formulation) and AZA-based immunosuppression. RESULTS: The incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection was 11% in both the TAC-MMF and CsA-MMF groups with only two patients in each group experiencing a rejection episode. This rejection rate was significantly decreased from that of the CsA-AZA historical group (77%, P<0.01). There were no significant differences in infection rates, including cytomegalovirus, or in metabolic control (HgbA1C, hypertension, and cholesterol levels). All patients remained on their initial immunosuppression regimen for the first 3 months after transplantation. Between 3 and 6 months after transplantation, three patients were switched from TAC to CsA for recurrent migraine headaches, posttransplant diabetes, and chronic cytomegalovirus infection. Two patients in the CsA-MMF group died of nonimmunologic causes (aspiration pneumonia and arrhythmia) between 3 and 6 months after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: The data from this study show that MMF treatment significantly decreases the incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection in SPK transplant recipients compared with AZA-treated historical controls. In addition, we conclude that TAC and CsA (Neoral), when combined with MMF, yield similar, low acute rejection rates with similar graft function and metabolic control. "
"Abstract: The problem of formulating plans under uncertainty and coping with dynamic decision problems is a major task of both artificial intelligence and control theory applications in medicine. In this paper we will describe a software package, called DT-Planner, designed to represent and solve dynamic decision problems that can be modelled as Markov decision processes, by exploiting a novel graphical formalism, called influence view. An influence view is a directed acyclic graph that depicts the probabilistic relationships between the problem state variables in a generic time transition; additional variables, called event variables, may be added, in order to describe the conditional independencies between state variables. By using the specified conditional independence structure, an influence view may allow a parsimonious specification of a Markov decision process. DT-Planner lets the user specify and manage models through a user-friendly graphical interface, and implements efficient for policy determination algorithms. DT-Planner is written in C with Open Interface libraries and can be obtained, for non commercial use, via anonymous ftp without charge. "
"Abstract: The pharmacokinetic profiles of single and multiple doses of loratadine, descarboethoxyloratadine (DCL) (the major active metabolite of loratadine), and pseudoephedrine were determined in a randomized, open-label, two-way crossover study in 24 healthy men. Subjects received a single dose (day 1) and multiple doses (days 3 to 10) of a once-daily (QD) formulation of loratadine 10 mg in an immediate-release coating and pseudoephedrine sulfate 240 mg in an extended-release core (CLAR-ITIN-D 24 HOUR tablets), and a twice-daily (BID) formulation of loratadine 5 mg in an immediate-release coating and pseudoephedrine sulfate 120 mg, with 60 mg in an immediate-release coating and 60 mg in the barrier-protected core (CLARITIN-D 12 HOUR tablets) in study sessions, each separated by a 10-day washout period. Both regimens were safe and well tolerated. On day 1, plasma loratadine, DCL, and pseudoephedrine concentrations were higher following the QD formulation than following the BID formulation, as expected. On day 10, loratadine and DCL maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) values were, on average, 87% and 35% higher, respectively, for the QD formulation than for the BID formulation; however, the values of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24) for loratadine and DCL were equivalent (90% confidence interval [CI]: 83% to 110% for loratadine; 90% to 107% for DCL). On day 10, pseudoephedrine Cmax and AUC0-24 values were equivalent (90% CI for Cmax: 94% to 109%; for AUC: 91% to 106%) for the two formulations, and lower pseudoephedrine concentrations were observed from 16 to 24 hours with the QD formulation. Both loratadine/pseudoephedrine formulations produced equivalent loratadine and DCL AUC0-24 values and equivalent pseudoephedrine Cmax and AUC0-24 values following multiple dosing. The lower pseudoephedrine concentrations in the evening with the QD formulation may minimize the potential for insomnia in patients when compared with the BID formulation. "
"Abstract: We studied accidental exposure to pediatric cough/cold medications in children under 6-y-of-age to determine whether the presence of an antihistamine (chlorpheniramine) in the product increased the likelihood for adverse outcomes. General accidental exposure cases reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) during 1988-1992 were analyzed for specific over-the-counter cough/cold pediatric products containing identical concentrations of active ingredients except for the presence or absence of chlorpheniramine. These case reports were evaluated for differences in medical outcome, symptom assessment, management site and therapy, as coded by poison control centers participating in the AAPCC Toxic Exposure Surveillance System. A total of 10,289 cases of accidental exposures were evaluated for the specific products included in this analysis. While these cases represented a small percentage of total exposures to these products (approximately 3% of total cases in children under 6-y-of-age reported to the AAPCC for all cough/cold medications during 1988-1992), they provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of the antihistamine component of the formulation. This study demonstrated that the presence of chlorpheniramine did not affect the medical outcome or the extent to which symptoms were reported. Additionally, similar percentages of exposures for these 2 products were managed at the site of the incident, and required either no therapy or only required fluids and observation. There were no notable differences in the percentage of cases which involved more aggressive treatment procedures (activated charcoal, cathartic, lavage). This analysis demonstrates that over-the-counter cough/cold medications containing chlorpheniramine present low potential for hazard in cases of accidental ingestions in young children and do not show an increased likelihood for adverse outcomes of accidental exposures compared to cough/cold medications not containing this antihistamine.

"BACKGROUND: Mometasone furoate (Nasonex), in a new once-daily aqueous nasal spray formulation, has been shown to be as effective and well-tolerated as twice-daily beclomethasone dipropionate aqueous nasal spray in treating symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis and perennial rhinitis. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness and tolerability of mometasone furoate to placebo and of fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray, all treatments administered once-daily, in patients with perennial rhinitis. METHODS: This was a 3-month, randomized, double-blind, double dummy, parallel group study in 550 patients, aged 12 to 77 years, at 25 centers in Canada, Latin America, and Europe. Patients allergic to at least one perennial allergen, with confirmed allergy history, skin test positivity, and moderate to severe symptomatology, were eligible to receive one of the following treatments, once daily in the morning: mometasone furoate 200 micrograms, fluticasone propionate 200 micrograms, or placebo. The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in total AM plus PM diary nasal symptom score over the first 15 days of treatment. RESULTS: Four hundred fifty-nine patients were valid for efficacy. For the primary efficacy variable, mometasone furoate was significantly (P < .01) more effective than placebo and was not statistically different from fluticasone propionate (percent reductions from baseline were 37, 39, and 22 for mometasone furoate, fluticasone propionate, and placebo, respectively). Generally, similar trends were seen for physician-evaluated total nasal symptoms, and patient-rated and physician-rated overall condition and response to therapy. Overall, mometasone furoate was at least as effective as fluticasone propionate at equivalent doses. There was no evidence of tachyphylaxis. All treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Mometasone furoate and fluticasone propionate adequately controlled symptoms of perennial rhinitis and were well tolerated. "
"Abstract: This case report correlates impaired cyclosporine absorption from the traditional oral formulation in a 9-year-old liver transplant recipient with subsequent acute allograft rejection. Although impaired absorption in this patient was documented by cyclosporine pharmacokinetic profiling (steady-state area under the cyclosporine concentration-time curve or AUC), no indication was evident from the pre-dose cyclosporine trough level, which was within the typical target range of blood concentrations. However, when the subject received the microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine the AUC value reflected an adequate absorption pattern. We recommend that if malabsorption is suspected in the de novo pediatric liver transplant patient, then single-sample pre-dose trough cyclosporine levels should not be relied on as an indicator of sufficient immunosuppression and that a limited sampling strategy be used to confirm or rule out impaired absorption. "
"BACKGROUND: In a randomized, controlled study we investigated the clinical efficacy of the microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine (Neoral) in comparison with Sandimmune (SIM) in the treatment of patients who underwent primary orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). METHODS: In total, 33 patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion before undergoing primary OLT to receive either Neoral or SIM. All 33 patients initially received intravenous cyclosporine, but as soon as it was tolerated, the oral study drug was initiated (median time, 3.6 days) and 17 patients received Neoral and 16 SIM (for both drugs, 10 mg/kg/day). Both groups were comparable with regard to age, sex, etiology of chronic liver disease, and hepatic biochemical profile. Episodes of rejection were diagnosed histologically and characterized as mild, moderate, or severe using criteria from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. RESULTS: Patients were followed for 1 year. Four patients in each group were discontinued prematurely. The reason for discontinuation of cyclosporine was drug-related complications in two of the NEO patients and in three of the SIM group; the other three were non-drug-related. Rejection episodes occurred in 9 of 17 patients (52.90%) in the Neoral group and in 9 of 16 patients (56.3%) in the SIM group. The total number of rejection episodes in each group was 14. However, in evaluating the severity of rejection histologically, nine episodes of rejection were characterized as moderate/ severe in the SIM group compared with only three in the Neoral group (P=0.027). Five of the nine moderate/severe rejection episodes in the SIM group occurred within the first 2 weeks after transplant. In contrast, moderate/severe rejection did not occur in the Neoral group in this early period. Two patients in the SIM group and no patients in the Neoral group required treatment with OKT3 for steroid-resistant rejection. There were no differences in mean doses or trough levels when comparing the two study groups. The incidence of adverse effects was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Neoral is a safe and efficacious drug in the treatment of primary OLT patients. Given comparable doses of cyclosporine in each group over 1 year, there was no significant difference in the total number of rejection episodes between study groups. However, patients treated with Neoral had a lower incidence of moderate/severe histologic rejection and were free of steroid-resistant rejection when compared with SIM-treated patients. "
"BACKGROUND: Cyclosporine is a potent immunosuppressive agent that is, however, associated with systemic hypertension and renal dysfunction. The purpose of this investigation was to study the pharmacokinetic and long-term renal and hypertensive effects of Sandimmune (Sandoz) versus the new Neoral (Novartis) formulation of cyclosporine in heart transplant recipients. METHODS: Twenty heart transplant recipients with stable conditions and aged 54 +/- 9 years were studied in an open-labeled single-arm conversion protocol. Twelve-hour pharmacokinetic studies were performed on Sandimmune and after 4 weeks of treatment with Neoral at similar dosage. The 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, creatinine clearance, and complete biochemistry profile were studied simultaneously to the pharmacokinetic studies. Six-month follow-up with serial measurements of cyclosporine levels, and biochemistry profile was completed. RESULTS: Conversion to Neoral resulted in a 24% increase in area-under-the-curve in spite of no significant changes in cyclosporine trough levels (165 +/- 48 [Sandimmune] vs 169 +/- 32 nmol/L; p = 0.26). Respectively, 16%, 68%, and 16% were poor, average, and good absorbers on Sandimmune versus 26% and 74% being average or good absorbers on Neoral. Averaged systolic and diastolic blood pressure were not affected by Neoral, but blood pressure readings increased in 20% of patients previously known as having hypertension. The 24-hour blood pressure data yielded no significant changes with Neoral, but the nocturnal drop in systolic blood pressure was attenuated by Neoral. Twenty-four-hour creatinine clearance was not affected by Neoral, but serum magnesium levels decreased significantly at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Neoral resulted in 24% increase in cyclosporine exposure without significant changes in trough levels, and improved absorption status. This greater drug exposure is well tolerated and resulted in a slight increase in blood pressure in a subset of patients and some decrease in magnesium levels, but it had no effect on renal function.

BACKGROUND: The ability of topical tretinoin to improve certain signs of skin photodamage has been shown previously. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to assess the effectiveness of tretinoin emollient cream in maintaining or further improving photodamaged skin during extended use. METHODS: Photodamaged subjects who completed 24 weeks of once-daily use of tretinoin emollient cream 0.05% (n = 149) or 0.01% (n = 149) continued to use the same strength formulation in a 24-week double-blind extension. RESULTS: Maintenance of improvement or continued reduction in signs of photodamage was noted in both investigators' and subjects' evaluations of the 0.05% and 0.01% preparations; these results were confirmed by skin replica analyses. Cutaneous side effects were less common during the extension study than during the first 24 weeks of therapy. CONCLUSION: Both strengths of tretinoin emollient cream (0.05% and 0.01%) appeared safe and effective in the treatment of photodamaged skin during a 48-week treatment period. 
"BACKGROUND: Cutaneous exposure to UVB radiation impairs the induction of contact hypersensitivity (CHS). Variable results have been found among studies examining the use of sunscreens to prevent UV-induced immunosuppression. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine whether solar-simulated exposure of human skin resulted in an impairment of CHS responses and whether the preapplication of an intermediate sun protection factor (SPF) sunscreen could prevent this locally UV-induced immunosuppression. METHODS: Irritant and CHS responses to dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) were randomly assessed in 160 human volunteers with or without UV exposure and with or without prior application of an SPF 15 sunscreen with high UVA protection. DNCB sensitization was performed 3 days after acute UV irradiation corresponding to 3 minimal erythema doses. RESULTS: After solar-simulated UV exposure, the percentage of positive responses to DNCB sensitization dropped from 95% to 50% (p = 0.003). Prior application of the sunscreen formulation did not modify the percentage of positive responses (90%) and maintained the immunization rate at 85% among volunteers exposed to UV. CONCLUSION: A localized sunburn can impair the afferent arm of CHS reactions in humans. The use of intermediate SPF sunscreens with high UVA protection adequately protects from the suppression of CHS responses that occurs after acute solar-simulated UV exposure. "
"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cyclosporin A (CyA) is a useful option in the treatment of adult onset Still's disease (ASD). METHODS: Low dose CyA was given to 6 patients with chronic or relapsing ASD who had not been prescribed any other second line agents during the previous 6 mo. RESULTS: The disease completely remitted in 4 patients and improved markedly in the remaining 2. The corticosteroid requirement was substantially reduced in all cases. Tolerability was rated good or very good by all patients but one, who reported good tolerance to CyA only in a new formulation. CONCLUSION: CyA may be included among the second line agents used in the treatment of refractory ASD. "
"Abstract: The photodynamic properties and biodistribution pattern of zinc dodecafluoro-4-sulphophthalocyanine (ZnPcF12S1), zinc hexadecafluorophthalocyanine (ZnPcF16) and zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) were evaluated in the murine EMT-6 tumour model. All 3 dyes were formulated as a Cremophor oil-water emulsion after initial solubilization in methanol, acetone and pyridine, respectively. Comparison of their phototoxicity after in vitro incubation with EMT-6 cells and exposure to various fluences of red light showed that ZnPcF12S1 is about 50 times more active than ZnPcF16, reflecting better cell-penetrating properties. Solubilisation of ZnPc in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone prior to formulation resulted in loss of photoactivity upon dilution in serum due to precipitation of the dye in the aqueous environment. In contrast, initial solubilisation in pyridine likely forms a ZnPc-pyridinium salt, and this preparation was 6 times more phototoxic than ZnPcF12S1. In vivo comparison of monosulphonated ZnPcF12S1 with perfluorinated ZnPcF16 showed improved pharmacokinetics in mice, including lower liver and spleen retentions and higher tumour-to-non-target tissue ratios. However, photodynamic therapy (PDT) of the EMT-6 tumour in BALB/c mice with red light, 24 or 48 hr post-injection of 1 micromol x kg(-1) of ZnPcF12S1 induced mortality. Lowering the drug and/or light dose or extending the time interval between drug administration and irradiation to 72 hr avoided adverse effects but also resulted in poor tumour response. The best tumour control (25% of animals) was obtained at 0.1 micromol x kg(-1) and a fluence of 400 J x cm(-2) at 24 hr post-injection. In contrast, ZnPcF16 required a 20-fold higher drug dose to induce a similar tumour response. The systemic shock following PDT with the amphiphilic ZnPcF12S1 likely results from extensive cellular effects. "
"Abstract: The purpose of this investigation was to study the possibility of renewing the immunosuppressive activity of cyclosporin by formulating the compound in liposomes modified with bioadhesive polymers. The liposomes prepared were evaluated both pharmacokinetically and pharmacodynamically. Tissue distribution and plasma pharmacokinetics of cyclosporin and model dye, sudan black, which is as hydrophobic as cyclosporin, were studied in rats after intravenous infusion (10 mg kg-1). The immunosuppressive efficacy of liposomal cyclosporin preparations was studied in the allogenic rat-heart-transplantation model, where cyclosporin therapy (10 mg kg-1) continued for one week. The entrapment of sudan black in liposomes modified with bioadhesive polymers resulted in higher sudan black delivery to the spleen and the liver than with standard sudan-black-loaded liposomes. Among the modified liposomes, those modified with carbopol 941 showed the most remarkable enhancing effect on the delivery of sudan black to these organs and total plasma clearance of sudan black decreased to 38.6 +/- 7.8 mL h-1 kg-1 (standard liposomes, 58.9 +/- 6.4 mL h-1 kg-1). Delivery of cyclosporin to the spleen and the liver was increased approximately twofold by modifying the liposomes with carbopol 941. In the preliminary study on the allogenic rat-heart-transplantation model, the mean survival days of the graft were 18.8 +/- 2.9 days for the group receiving cyclosporin liposomes modified with carbopol 941, 14.2 +/- 4.4 days for the group receiving standard cyclosporin liposomes and 7.6 +/- 0.5 days for the group receiving cyclosporin solution. The encapsulation of cyclosporin in liposomes modified with bioadhesive polymer enhanced the residence time of cyclosporin in the systemic circulation, resulting in approximately twofold greater delivery of cyclosporin to the spleen and liver. However, in the allogenic rat-heart-transplantation model no significant difference was detected between the immunosuppressive efficacy of cyclosporin encapsulated in bioadhesive polymer-modified liposomes and that encapsulated in standard liposomes. "
"Abstract: Two clinical trials were conducted to evaluate the safety and antipsoriatic efficacy of a new 0.05 percent emollient formulation of clobetasol propionate (CP). In a crossover study of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis effects in 12 patients with psoriasis or eczema, 1.5 gm of CP emollient, applied to lesions twice daily for seven consecutive days, resulted in fewer patients with serum cortisol concentrations < 10 micrograms/100 mL than CP cream 0.05 percent (1vs 4); such concentrations were seen in two other patients during both treatment phases. A double-blind, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial in patients with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis showed that four weeks' treatment with CP emollient 0.43 to 0.5 gm twice daily (n = 35) was significantly more effective than emollient vehicle (n = 39) in reducing total signs/symptoms and scaling by Day 4, erythema and skin thickening by Day 8, and pruritus by Day 15. CP emollient was rated superior to vehicle by Day 4 in physician's gross assessment ratings and by Day 15 in patient's self-assessment ratings. In all assessments, CP emollient continued to be superior to vehicle during the remainder of the treatment period and two-week posttreatment period. No significant differences were observed in tolerability or serum cortisol effects during the course of the study. "
"Abstract: The purpose of this study was to evaluate, in an ex-vivo study, the absorption of cyclosporine A on bovine cornea after 24 h contact with various drug delivery systems containing 1% cyclosporine A and in comparison with an olive oil formulation as the reference vehicle for cyclosporine A. The different formulations studied were poly(acrylic acid) polymeric gels in aqueous/non-aqueous solvents, polyisobutylcyanoacrylate nanocapsules, and a combination of both formulations. The histological effects of these formulation on corneal cells after 24 h of contact were also studied. The lowest absorption rate of cyclosporine A was found using olive oil with a percent absorption of 2.52 +/- 1.52% (259 +/- 171 micrograms/g cornea). The three formulations developed for this study, nanocapsules, poly(acrylic acid) polymeric gel and nanocapsules gel showed significantly better absorption of CsA than olive oil, with a mean percent absorption of 5.81 +/- 2.04% (621 +/- 218 micrograms/g cornea), 6.09 +/- 2.93% (651 +/- 313 micrograms cornea) and 7.92 +/- 2.55% (847 +/- 273 micrograms/g cornea) respectively. As we studied the penetration of cyclosporine A into the different layers of the cornea, we observed that for all formulations, CsA remained at the corneal surface and did not penetrate the whole cornea. The histological study showed that olive oil, nanocapsules and poly(acrylic acid) gel in aqueous/non-aqueous solvents show some modifications on the cornea, contrary to the nonocapsules gel which did not indicate any toxic effect. The nanocapsule gel, with the highest percent absorption along with its margin of safety on the cornea, seems to present a new promising drug delivery system for ocular administration. "
"Abstract: A discussion of the pathologic findings found with aging and photodamage is used to formulate a rational preoperative regimen, treatment technique, and maintenance regimen. Details of laser treatment technique, anesthesia, and postoperative care are given. Possible contraindications are discussed, as are the pros and cons of early versus late treatment. "
"Abstract: The introduction of cyclosporin, refinement in surgical techniques and improvement in allograft preservation have all led to an improvement in graft and ultimately patient survival. Cyclosporin is a lipophilic cyclic polypeptide produced by Trichoderma, a fungus isolated from Norwegian soil. Cyclosporin is a potent, selective and powerful immunosuppressive agent possessing a narrow therapeutic window. Substitution among different formulations of cyclosporin for economic reasons, without close monitoring of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, can induce undesirable toxic effects. A number of recent reports, largely anecdotal, of adverse drug reactions and acute cellular rejection after conversion from the standard formulation to the microemulsion formulation of cyclosporin have created uncertainty over the therapeutic equivalency of these agents. This leading article reviews the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and adverse drug reactions of cyclosporin as well as the potential risks associated with switching between cyclosporin formulations in stable renal transplant recipients. Caution should be employed when switching between cyclosporin formulations. Since data are limited, long-term prospective studies are necessary to delineate the role of high peak concentrations obtained from the microemulsion formulation in relation to cyclosporin-induced chronic nephropathy. The significance of the reduction in pharmacokinetic variability with use of the microemulsion formulation in terms of graft and patient survival remains unclear. "
"Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) as a cancer treatment is notable for its quite low side effects in comparison with those of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, the accumulation of porphyrin derivatives used in PDT into tumor tissues is rather low. Since long-circulating liposomes are known to accumulate passively into tumor tissues, we liposomalized a porphyrin derivative, benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid ring A (BPD-MA), and used these liposomes to investigate the usefulness of PDT for tumor-bearing mice. BPD-MA was liposomalized into glucuronate-modified liposomes, which are known to be long-circulating. These liposomes were injected i.v. into Balb/c mice bearing Meth A sarcoma, and tumor regression and survival time were monitored after irradiation with laser light. Tumor regression and complete curing of tumor (80% cure rate by the treatment with 6 mg/kg BPD-MA) were observed when long circulating liposomalized BPD-MA was injected and laser-irradiated. In contrast, only a 20% cure rate was obtained when the animals were treated with BPD-MA solution or BPD-MA entrapped in conventional liposomes. These results suggest that a long-circulating liposomal formulation of photo-sensitive agents is useful for PDT. "
"BACKGROUND: Patients with sensitive skin can present a challenge for dermatologists and cosmetic chemists alike. Knowledge of this common skin condition and appropriate dermatologic treatment, in combination with a rational approach to skin-care product selection, are important to patient well-being. OBJECTIVE: This report summarizes the subjective and objective findings in patients with sensitive skin while presenting a theory to explain disease physiology. Finally, a recommended treatment approach and formulation guidelines are presented. CONCLUSION: Sensitive skin possesses one or more of the following anatomic cutaneous changes: heightened neurosensory input, enhanced immune responsiveness, and/or diminished barrier function. Cosmetic and skin-care product formulation considerations for sensitive skin include products with a paucity of ingredients, absence of common sensitizers, minimum number of irritants, and absence of cutaneous sensory or vasodilatory stimulants. "
"Abstract: Although many treatments are available for genital warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), none are uniformly successful in the treatment of this disease. Most current treatment options work by destroying affected tissue, either by a cytotoxic or a physically ablative mode of action. Interferons have antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory activities, but these have not translated into a high level of cure rates against warts. With all current treatments, recurrent warts are common. Therapies currently being investigated include a 5-fluorouracil/epinephrine collagen gel that achieves high concentrations of 5-fluorouracil at the site of injection. Other new treatment modalities focus on activating the host's immune system or improving the delivery of therapeutic compounds to the affected site. Imiquimod, a novel immune-response modifier, induces interferon and a number of other endogenous cytokines. A cream formulation containing 5% imiquimod resulted in good total clearance rates and generally tolerable side effects in controlled clinical trials of patients with external genital warts. Perhaps the most effective means for managing HPV disease would be a vaccine that prevents the occurrence of genital warts. Although it is unlikely that such a vaccine will be introduced in the near future, preliminary studies indicate that it may be possible to develop suitable prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. "
"Abstract: Epidemiologic evidence on the relationship between mineral oil exposure and cancer is reviewed. The review is restricted to occupations involving substantial dermal and inhalational exposure and for which an epidemiologic literature exists: metal machining, print press operating, and cotton and jute spinning. Mineral oils are complex mixtures of aliphatic hydrocarbons, naphthenics, and aromatics, the relative distribution of which depends on the source of the oil and the method of refinement. End-use products contain a variety of additives, and contamination by other agents generally occurs during use. Suspect agents include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) (particularly benz[a]pyrene), nitrosamines, chlorinated paraffins, long-chain aliphatics, sulfur, N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine, and formaldehyde. The heterogeneity of this exposure makes epidemiologic study difficult and meta-analysis inappropriate. Nonetheless, several associations emerge from the literature with varying degrees of support. There is clear evidence that early formulations of mineral oils used in cotton and jute spinning and in metal machining were carcinogenic to the skin. Associations of mineral oil exposure with laryngeal and rectal cancer have received some support in the literature, particularly with respect to straight oils. Evidence is suggestive that grinding operations (which can entail either mineral oil-based or ethanolamine-based fluids) are associated with excess risk of cancer of the esophagus, stomach, and pancreas. A number of bladder cancer case-control studies have noted an association with work as a machinist. There is limited evidence of an association with cancer of the colon, prostate, and sinonasal region. Several studies of printers have yielded positive findings for lung cancer, whereas studies in metal machinists have been generally negative. The PAH and nitrosamine content of current formulations is lower than in the past and the implications of these changes in composition to the carcinogenicity of the formulations are not yet known. "
"Abstract: In this study we compared the plasma distribution and arterial accumulation of a photosensitizer, benzoporphyrin derivative (BPD), in two models of atherosclerosis: the spontaneous lesions of the Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbit and induced lesions of the balloon-injured, cholesterol-fed New Zealand white (NZW) rabbit. Selective uptake and retention of a photosensitizer by the abnormal portion of a vessel is a necessity in order for photodynamic therapy to become a successful modality for inhibition of intimal hyperplasia, selective removal of atherosclerotic tissue or imaging of diseased arteries. Liposome-based formulations were compared to freshly isolated native low density lipoprotein (LDL) and acetylated-LDL (Ac-LDL) as delivery vehicles for BPD. Plasma distribution of the photosensitizer was analyzed by KBr density gradient ultracentrifugation. Although the delivery vehicle influenced plasma distribution immediately postinjection, BPD subsequently partitioned according to the plasma concentration of the lipoproteins. Photosensitizer level in plaque and normal artery specimens was determined by ethyl acetate extraction and spectrofluorometric measurement. The measurement of BPD in normal and atherosclerotic arterial tissue demonstrated a selective accumulation in atherosclerotic tissue. Preassociation with LDL and Ac-LDL enhanced accumulation of BPD in atherosclerotic tissue when compared with normal artery (mean ratios of 2.8 and 4.1 were achieved, respectively). These results indicate that the preferential uptake of BPD by atherosclerotic plaque can be enhanced by preassociation with plasma lipoproteins, suggesting that light activation could lead to a highly selective destruction of diseased vascular tissue. "
"Abstract: Fluticasone propionate is a fluoromethyl androstane 17beta-carbiothioate that is classified for dermatological use as a moderate potency corticosteroid. It is available in 0.05% cream and 0.005% ointment formulations for the treatment of patients with inflammatory dermatoses responsive to corticosteroids. Although it demonstrates greater activity than other corticosteroids of similar potency in vasoconstrictor assays in humans, fluticasone propionate demonstrates low potential to cause significant systemic effects such as suppression of the hypothalamopituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This is because it has a high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and high lipophilicity, and the small amount of drug that is absorbed is rapidly metabolised to the inactive carboxylic acid derivative in the liver (i.e. it has low systemic bioavailability). In clinical trials, the efficacy of fluticasone propionate cream at 4 weeks did not differ significantly from that of hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1% cream in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and betamethasone valerate 0.1% cream in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. Likewise, after 4 weeks, the ointment form of fluticasone propionate had similar efficacy to betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% in patients with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis, although the latter agent may have a faster onset of activity in patients with atopic dermatitis. Fluticasone propionate ointment was generally more effective than hydrocortisone butyrate ointment in patients with psoriasis. A sustained response was usually observed after about 1 week's application of fluticasone propionate, and although once and twice daily administration had similar efficacy, a twice daily regimen may have a slightly faster onset of effect. In trials which included both adults and children, the only adverse events reported were local cutaneous reactions (most frequently, pruritus). Thus, fluticasone propionate, with its low potential for systemic toxicity and possible advantage of once daily administration, is a useful addition to the topical corticosteroids available for the treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. "
"BACKGROUND: The new microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine (CsA-ME) is more bioavailable than cyclosporine (CsA) in de novo renal transplant patients. Therefore, it was of interest to compare the safety profile of each formulation in such patients. METHODS: In a multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group study, 101 renal transplant recipients were randomized after transplantation to receive either CsA (n=50) or CsA-ME (n=51) capsules twice daily for 2 years. Of these patients, 54 (CsA, n=26; CsA-ME, n=28) completed 1 year of the study and entered the second-year, double-blind extension. Initial dose at the time of transplantation was 5 mg/kg b.i.d.; doses were titrated to target trough levels. METHODS: The mean (+/- SD) doses at the end of 2 years were 4.6 +/- 1.8 and 3.8 +/- 1.1 mg/kg per day for CsA- and CsA-ME-treated patients, respectively. The mean (+/- SD) CsA trough levels at end point were 187 +/- 63 and 210 +/- 95 ng/ml for CsA- and CsA-ME-treated patients, respectively. At least one adverse event was reported by 25/26 (96%) of CsA- and 27/28 (96%) of CsA-ME-treated patients. No patient discontinued the study because of adverse events. No deaths occurred during the study. Renal function, as measured by serum creatinine levels, and blood pressure were comparable over time in both treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in safety and tolerability between CsA- and CsA-ME-treated kidney recipients for 2 years after transplantation. "
"Abstract: In this review we examine the complex interactions between lipoprotein metabolism, immunosuppressive drug therapy, and inflammation and the potential benefits of lipid-lowering drug therapy after heart transplantation. The newer formulations of cyclosporine, Neoral (Novartis Pharmaceuticals; Basle, Switzerland), and other newer agents such as tacrolimus may have advantages in regard to lipid metabolism as compared with traditional triple-drug immunosuppression. Lipoprotein levels may influence both the toxicity and efficacy of cyclosporine. Dyslipidemia may adversely influence inflammation and rejection in the allograft. Two recent clinical trials have shown that lipid-lowering therapy with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor alone or in combination with low-density lipoprotein apheresis may confer significant benefits toward preventing transplant coronary artery disease. "
"BACKGROUND: Embryofetal developmental toxicity associated with oral administration of vitamin A analogs has led to concern about risks from topical application. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate the potential developmental toxicity of tretinoin emollient cream when applied to the skin of pregnant New Zealand white rabbits during organogenesis (gestational days 7 through 19). METHODS: Twenty rabbits each were randomly assigned to a control group (group I) or to receive vehicle (group II) or tretinoin emollient cream topically at dosages of 10 (0.05 mg/kg*, group III) or 100 (0.5 mg/kg*, group IV) times that used clinically in humans. Does and fetuses were examined for tretinoin-induced toxic effects, and maternal plasma tretinoin and metabolite levels were measured. RESULTS: The rate of abortion was increased significantly in does in group IV (p < or = 0.01) compared with the control group. Dosage-dependent increases in incidence and severity of skin reactions occurred in groups administered the vehicle and the two dosages of tretinoin. Does in groups III and IV had clinical and necropsy observations that were considered direct or indirect effects of tretinoin administration, persistent weight loss, and reduced feed consumption. Maternal endogenous plasma tretinoin levels were below the lower limit of quantitation of 5 ng/ml and were not significantly altered with treatment. Group IV had significantly reduced mean fetal body weight (p < or = 0.01) and a greater frequency of resorptions compared with group I. Although external, visceral, or skeletal alterations occurred at significantly greater levels in group III, they were unrelated to tretinoin administration because the fetal incidences were not dosage dependent, and the litter incidence did not significantly differ from the control group values. CONCLUSION: Maternally toxic dosages of tretinoin were associated with an increased incidence of abortions and resorptions and reduced fetal body weight, two end points of developmental toxicity. Consistent with the absence of detectable tretinoin plasma levels, however, no changes in fetal morphology were attributable to tretinoin administration. *The milligrams per kilogram dosage refers to the amount of active ingredient (tretinoin). The 0.05 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg groups were treated with 0.005% and 0.05% wt/wt tretinoin emollient cream formulation. The 0.05% tretinoin emollient cream is the Renova clinical formulation. The 10 and 100 times clinical multiples refer to Renova clinical multiples and are based on a 50 kg adult patient's applying 500 mg of 0.05% tretinoin emollient cream formulation daily to yield a clinical dosage of 0.005 mg/kg.

"Abstract: Cyclosporin A (CyA) is the primary immunosuppressive agent for the prophylaxis of rejection episodes in renal, cardiac, liver, and other transplants. Recently, its use in autoimmune diseases has been investigated as well. Although several studies have produced promising results, nephrotoxicity and hypertension can result from CyA treatment, and their development must be understood in order to facilitate patient management. This article describes the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) responses in two populations of patients during three months of CyA therapy. Study A involved psoriasis patients and Study B involved postoperative renal transplant patients. The relationship between blood pressure and systemic CyA exposure and other covariates was evaluated using linear mixed effects modeling. Temporal patterns of blood pressure changes with varying duration of CyA exposure were investigated. In Study A, the psoriasis patients showed transient exposure-related increases in DBP on CyA. These elevations, while statistically significant, were clinically insignificant. In Study B, the renal transplant patients showed no CyA-related rises in DBP. In neither study was there evidence for a difference in effect on DBP between Sandimmune and Neoral, the two formulations of CyA presently approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration, after differences in CyA exposure were taken into account. "
"Abstract: Pediatric liver transplant recipients constitute a population characterized by a particularly unpredictable and poor bioavailability of cyclosporin (CyA). Even though several adult studies show that the new oral formulation of CyA, Neoral (NEO), produces better bioavailability and blood level predictability, few data describe its pharmacokinetics in children. We performed a complete analysis of the pharmacokinetics of NEO in ten small children after primary liver transplantation. Three pharmacokinetic profiles were set up with data obtained from tests taken during i.v. administration of CyA, after the first oral NEO dose, and after the last NEO dose before discharge from the hospital. The mean half-lives obtained were 8.1, 7.7, and 6.9 h, respectively, and the bioavailabilities were 22% and 21% for the first and last NEO doses. A large interpatient variability was observed. This was due, in part, to episodes of diarrhea that interfered with the pharmacokinetic evaluation and, in part, to the variability of post-transplant hepatic function. There was a good correlation between CyA trough levels and their related AUCs for both NEO profiles (r = 0.93 and r = 0.74, respectively). We conclude that, even though the pediatric OLT population remains more unpredictable than that of adults, NEO has a relatively rapid half-life and a remarkably improved bioavailability. "
"OBJECTIVE: To consider the effect of changing from a conventional release formulation of diltiazem to the controlled diffusion diltiazem formulation on the cyclosporin-sparing effect in kidney transplant recipients. METHODS: Seven stable renal transplant recipients were studied on two separate occasions following at least 2 weeks stabilisation on either formulation. The order of administration of the two formulations was not randomised as all patients were already prescribed lower dosages of diltiazem before entering this phase of a larger study. The doses of diltiazem used were 90 mg (conventional release diltiazem) taken twice daily and 180 mg controlled diffusion diltiazem taken in the morning. RESULTS: Whilst there were no overall significant differences between the two formulations, the study demonstrated considerable interpatient variability when changing to the controlled diffusion formulation, particularly following the morning cyclosporin dose, with three patients showing a reduced cyclosporin AUC (30-60%) and one an increased cyclosporin AUC of 36%. CONCLUSION: A change in formulation of the cyclosporin-sparing agent may result in unpredictable alterations in cyclosporin concentrations and resultant clinical sequelae. "
"Abstract: A microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine (CsA) has improved absorption compared with the original form. The purpose of this case control study was to assess the safety and efficacy of the microemulsion without intravenous CsA for induction immunosuppression in adult liver transplantation. Twenty-one consecutive patients receiving induction immunosuppression with the microemulsion 15 mg/kg/day were compared with 20 patients receiving intravenous CsA and the original oral form. Both groups received the same dose of methylprednisilone. Twenty of 21 patients receiving the microemulsion required no intravenous CsA to achieve target CsA levels. All patients receiving the original form received initial intravenous CsA. There was no difference in trough CsA levels between the two groups at 24 and 48 hours. The microemulsion group had 24 hr and 48 hr trough CsA levels of 227+/-15 and 520+/-300 ng/ml by monoclonal RIA while the intravenous CsA group had 24 and 48 hr trough levels of 293+/-18 and 405+/-91 ng/ml. CsA levels analyzed by HPLC were 20% lower than by RIA. The frequency of adverse events resulting in reduction of drug dosage was similar for the microemulsion and the original form: neurotoxicity (23 vs. 40%, P=.30); nephrotoxicity (25 vs. 45%, P=.32), and no patients required dialysis. There was no difference in septic complications. One patient required discontinuation of the microemulsion in an attempt to reverse severe neurotoxicity. A total of 75% of microemulsion patients were rejection free at 3 months while only 35% of CsA patients remained rejection free (P=0.02). These data suggest that the use of the microemulsion without intravenous CsA in liver transplantation is safe and efficacious, and may result in decreased episodes of acute rejection. "
"BACKGROUND: The co-prescription of drugs which elevate cyclosporin blood concentration has been advocated to reduce the costs associated with use of this expensive immunosuppressive drug. This is the first time that drugs have been widely prescribed for an economic purpose and while it is thought to be widespread, there are little published data on the extent of this practice in Australia and New Zealand. AIMS: To determine the extent to which cyclosporin sparing agents are used by Australian and New Zealand organ transplant centres, to determine which agents are used and why these agents are used by some but not all centres. METHODS: Organ transplant centres were surveyed via a questionnaire. RESULTS: Considerable variation in use of cyclosporin sparing agents exists both within and across organ transplant types by Australian and New Zealand transplant centres. Diltiazem use is more widespread than ketoconazole. CONCLUSIONS: Little of the variability in use of cyclosporin sparing agents can be explained by scientific considerations. While the central government benefits from the significant cost savings achieved by the use of cyclosporin sparing agents, individual transplant units may not. Transplant units may however be the major target in the event of litigation arising as a result of adverse effects. The availability of generic brands and improved formulations of cyclosporin may affect the viability of using cyclosporin sparing agents. "
"Abstract: Intrinsic (chronological) skin ageing is characterized by atrophy of the skin with loss of elasticity and slowed metabolic activity. The superposition of environmental damage, particularly exposure to ultraviolet radiation (photodamage), on the intrinsic ageing process results, at least initially, in a hypertrophic repair response, with a thickened epidermis and increased melanogenesis. Even more striking changes occur in the dermis: massive elastosis (deposition of abnormal elastic fibres), collagen degeneration, and twisted, dilated microvasculature. Regular use of a sunscreen alone appears to allow some repair as well as protection from further photodamage. Topical tretinoin has been shown to partially reverse the clinical and histological changes induced by the combination of sunlight exposure and chronological ageing. A formulation of tretinoin in an emollient cream (Retinova, Renova), developed specifically for the treatment of photodamaged skin, has been extensively investigated in multicentre, double-blind trials and has been shown to produce significant improvement within 4-6 months of daily use, compared with vehicle alone, as part of a regimen including sun protection and moisturizer use. Histological changes in the epidermis and dermis noted after 12 months suggest tretinoin repairs photodamage by reconstitution of the rete pegs, repair of keratinocyte ultrastructural damage, more even distribution of melanocytes and melanin pigment, deposition of new papillary dermal collagen, and improvements in vasculature. Alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) have also been widely used for therapy of photodamaged skin, and these compounds have been reported to normalize hyperkeratinization and increase viable epidermal thickness and dermal glycosaminoglycans content. The single randomized controlled study now available appears to substantiate AHA efficacy and safety. In summary, recent work has substantially elucidated the ageing processes that affect the skin and has demonstrated that many of the unwanted changes can be improved by topical therapy. "
"Abstract: Treatment with cyclosporine is beneficial for many dermatologic diseases such as psoriasis, lichen planus, Behçet disease, atopic dermatitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. The selective action of cyclosporine on helper T cells and its rapid therapeutic action and weak myelotoxicity are the key advantages in the treatment of many dermatologic diseases. Nevertheless, drug toxicity, especially nephrotoxicity, high rates of relapse after treatment cessation, and high cost have limited its use to those diseases refractory to other therapies. Herein we discuss the use of cyclosporine for dermatologic diseases relative to efficacy, dosage, safety profile, and monitoring. In addition, we review the formulations and metabolism of cyclosporine; discuss its mechanism of action, clinical indications in dermatology, and side effects; and provide usage guidelines for this drug. Cyclosporine can be safely administered when potential toxicities, dosing, and monitoring guidelines are known. "
"Abstract: Ketoprofen creams were evaluated for the treatment of periodontal disease in a placebo-controlled, double-blind study in the rhesus monkeys, Macaca mulatta. Two formulations containing ketoprofen (1%), with or without vitamin E, were evaluated against appropriate controls (8 monkeys per group). Two weeks prior to treatment, the animals received prophylaxis on only the left side of the mouth (spontaneous model). Selected teeth on the right side of the mouth were ligated (ligature model). The creams were administered to the gingiva once daily at a standard dose of 1.8 ml per monkey for 6 months. Clinical assessments were made 2 wk before initiation, at baseline and 1, 2, 3 and 6 months post-treatment. The clinical parameters included plaque formation, gingival redness, edema, bleeding on probing and Ramfjord Attachment Level measurements (RAL). Radiographs were taken at 2 wk before initiation, baseline and at 3 and 6 months post-treatment. Digital, subtraction radiography was used to measure vertical linear bone loss along the interproximal root surfaces of the left and right mandibular first molars. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) was collected for biochemical assays on PGE2, TxB2, LTB4, IL-1 beta and TNF alpha. There were no significant differences among groups with respect to gingival indices. Radiographic data demonstrated significant positive effects on bone activity in both groups treated with ketoprofen formulations with improvement over time in the ligature model (0.01 < or = p < or = 0.04). The placebo group exhibited bone loss of 1.96 +/- 0.48 and 1.40 +/- 0.56 mm per site at 3 and 6 months, respectively. The group treated with ketoprofen cream showed an apparent bone gain of 0.28 +/- 0.41 and 0.78 +/- 0.47 mm per site at 3 and 6 months, respectively. The group treated with ketoprofen cream containing vitamin E showed a mean bone loss of 0.41-0.48 mm per site at 3 months with improvement to an apparent bone gain of 0.31 +/- 0.44 mm per site at 6 months. The biochemical data demonstrated early and significant suppression of GCF-LTB4 by both ketoprofen formulations at 1 month, which preceded the significant suppression of GCF-PGE2 at 2 and 3 months in the ligature model (p < 0.003) and at 2 to 6 months in the spontaneous model (p < 0.02). We conclude that ketoprofen at 1% level in suitable topical vehicles can effectively inhibit GCF-LTB4 and GCF-PGE2 and positively alter alveolar bone activity in the ligature-induced model of periodontitis in the monkey.

"Abstract: A study of conversion from the standard cyclosporine treatment to a microemulsion formulation was performed in 29 stable pediatric liver transplant patients. The study was divided into conversion and in follow-up phases. While on therapy with the standard formulation at a mean daily dose+/-SD of 231+/-101.8 mg patients had a mean cyclosporine trough level of 188.7+/-51.4 ng/ml. Following a 1:1 conversion from the standard to the microemulsion formulation an increase in the cyclosporine trough level was observed in 75% of the patients. The mean cyclosporine trough level at this point was 221.5+/-69.7 ng/ml. On follow-up, the dose had to be reduced an average of 21.7% in 49% of the patients, whereas the rest remained stable. The incidence of adverse events was not significant and no differences were observed between the two formulations. The pharmacokinetic study of the microemulsion in 11 patients showed a monophasic curve, with an early absorption at 30 min and maximum concentration+/-SD of 880.8+/-72.8 ng/ml and time to maximum concentration of 1.5+/-0.12 hr. Basal time showed the least correlation with the area under the curve and T4 the most statistically significant. The microemulsion showed better bioavailability and pharmacokinetic characteristics than the standard formulation. "
"Abstract: CsA-ME is a new oral microemulsion formulation of CsA. Studies in stable liver grafted patients with cholestasis and subsequent poor absorption of the conventional cyclosporine formulation showed a substantial increase in CsA absorption after conversion to CsA-ME. To investigate its use in patients during the early course after liver transplantation we recruited 50 liver transplant recipients in two centers. During the first study phase A CsA-ME was administered to 20 patients in incremental doses after a short initial course of intravenous cyclosporine. During the second study phase B (30 patients) CsA-ME was administered from the time of transplantation. One year actual patient and graft survival of patients included in phase A and B of the trial was between 90% and 93.3%; 50% and 60% of the patients enrolled in phase A and phase B of the trial were free from rejection at month 3, respectively. Chronic rejection was diagnosed in one patient. No increase in the incidence of CsA related side effects was observed. The optimum CsA-ME starting dose was found to be 10 mg/kgbw/day for patients without external biliary diversion and 15 mg/kgbw/day for patients with a T tube in situ. Using these starting doses, 26 consecutive patients with external bile diversion via T tube were treated with CsA-ME from the day of transplantation. Intravenous CsA was necessary only in three patients. When CsA-ME absorption in patients with stable liver function was compared with that in patients with early liver dysfunction, no difference in the pharmacokinetic profiles was observed between the groups. Our results indicate that CsA-ME therapy is effective and well tolerated in liver graft recipients, even in patients with external biliary diversion during the early posttransplant phase. Thus, CsA-ME is a useful alternative to intravenous CsA treatment in these patients. "
"Abstract: A comparison was made of the efficacy, tolerability, safety and steady state pharmacokinetics of Sandimmun and Neoral in 11 stable atopic dermatitis patients already on Sandimmun. The study was of an open, crossover design. At entry into the trial, patients were switched to Neoral for 28 days. Treatment was switched back to Sandimmun for Days 28 to 42. The morning dose was given fasting, the evening dose after a standard meal. All measures of eczema severity improved during the Neoral treatment period. Neoral was markedly better tolerated with fewer side-effects. Switching from Sandimmun to Neoral at the same dose resulted in less variable pharmacokinetic profiles in both fasted and fed states. There was an increase in bioavailability with better, less variable and faster absorption, with a slightly reduced tmax, a higher mean Cmax (+43%) and a higher mean AUC (+30%) in fasted, but not fed patients. Higher trough levels (Cmin) occurred throughout for Neoral. These differences between the two formulations were not associated with any changes in safety parameters. Overall, Neoral was equivalent or superior to Sandimmun in tolerability and efficacy when given on a 1:1 dose basis. "
"Abstract: Cyclosporin has been shown to be highly effective in psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and numerous other dermatoses. Despite the effectiveness of cyclosporin, the response varies somewhat between individuals. Some may not respond, and often this is linked with unpredictable absorption of the traditional formulation. Cases of atopic dermatitis and psoriasis previously resistant to cyclosporin have responded well to a new microemulsified formulation, Neoral, and formal trials are now underway to investigate its use in these indications. Preliminary data from a clinical trial using the new formulation in chronic plaque psoriasis suggest that this has similar efficacy and tolerability to the traditional formulation in this condition, and that repeated short courses of therapy may be well tolerated. "
"Abstract: The role of combination therapy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is increasing with the development of new treatment modalities. Past combinations of slow-acting anti-rheumatic drugs resulted in either excessive side-effects or lack of efficacy over single-agent therapy. However, refined methodology and a better understanding of the mechanism of action of newer agents have led to improved combinations, which appear more promising. In particular, in a 6 month, randomized, double-blind trial, the combination of cyclosporin (CyA) with methotrexate was found to be more efficacious than methotrexate alone, providing enhanced clinical benefit, without evidence of increased adverse events. The mean final dose of 2.97 mg/kg per day CyA in combination was lower than that required for CyA monotherapy. Further, a new formulation of CyA, with improved bioavailability, should provide enhanced efficacy and an acceptable safety profile, not only as monotherapy but also in combination with agents such as methotrexate. These developments offer new hope to patients with progressive RA, which is unresponsive to conventional therapy. "
"BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal side effects are associated with the oral ingestion of 8-methoxsalen (8-MOP), including the liquid and crystalline formulations. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether the gastrointestinal symptoms associated with 8-MOP could be decreased by altering the route of administration. METHODS: In an open pilot study, 8-MOP rectal suppositories were given to six patients with psoriasis vulgaris who had significant nausea or abdominal pain with the oral liquid form of the drug. RESULTS: On a scale of 0 to 5, this group of patients reported a mean score of 4.4 for nausea, 0.3 for vomiting, 2.1 for abdominal pain, and 1.3 for headaches with oral 8-MOP. With the suppository form, the mean scores were 0 for nausea, 0 for vomiting, 0 for abdominal pain, and 0 for headaches. These latter values represent scores for the entire treatment period. Clinical severity scores of psoriasis improved from a mean of 6.5 (maximum possible score = 9) at the start of the trial to a mean of 1 at its conclusion. Plasma 8-MOP levels of more than 100 ng/ml were observed in all patients who received the suppositories; in only one patient were the 8-MOP plasma levels significantly higher with the oral form than with the rectal form. CONCLUSION: Rectal suppositories of 8-MOP were associated with significantly fewer gastrointestinal side effects than the oral form of the drug; this was accomplished without compromising clinical efficacy.

"Abstract: Twelve asymptomatic subjects (4 female, 8 male), being allergic to grass pollen proved by positive anamnesis, positive Prick-test and positive nasal provocation test, were challenged under controlled conditions with purified airborne grass pollen of Dactylis glomerata in the Vienna Challenge Chamber (VCC), located at the Universitätsklinik für Hals-Nasen-Ohrenheilkunde, Allgemeines Krankenhaus (AKH), der Stadt Wien, Vienna (Austria) by means of a double-blind, randomised, cross-over design, with 2 weeks wash-out periods between. Efficacy and safety of 2 concentrations of dimethindene (dimethindene maleate; DMM, CAS 3614-69-5, Fenistil resp. Foristal) 0.025% DMM, 0.1% DMM) were tested vs placebo as negative control and vs 0.1% azelastine as positive control, as topical nasal sprays. The tested nasal sprays were applied as single doses in the morning (2 puffs = 0.28 ml of the respective solution) to each nostril 15 min before the start of the 4 h lasting provocation procedure in the VCC, thus representing a total daily dose of 0.14 mg resp. 0.56 mg DMM and 0.56 mg azelastine, respectively. Compared to placebo, the objective variables nasal flow (150 Pa., measured by active anterior rhinomanometry) and nasal secretion (g), showed similar onset of antiobstructive and antisecretory effects in the nose after 0.1% DMM and 0.1% azelastine, respectively. The same applied for the subjective nasal symptom complex and for nasal symptom scores, evaluated by Visual Analog Scale (VAS): Time curves showed statistically significant and clinically relevant superiority of 0.1% DMM and 0.1% azelastine vs placebo, during the 4 h lasting provocation period. 0.025% DMM was not significantly different from placebo. No systemic adverse events were reported after the 4 tested preparations. Only a total of 3 subjects reported very slight local irritations (1 subject after placebo, 1 subject after 0.025% DMM and 1 subject after 0.1% azelastine). However, after 0.1% DMM no local adverse events were reported. It is concluded from this study that 0.1% DMM as nasal spray, is an efficient and safe galenical formulation for nasal spray application for patients suffering from seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR).

"Abstract: An in vivo method was developed to measure the effectiveness of skin protective creams against 2 dye indicator solutions: methylene blue in water and oil red O in ethanol, representative of model hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds. 3 representative barrier creams commercialized as effective against lipophilic, hydrophilic, or lipophilic and hydrophilic substances were assayed by measurements of the dye in cyanoacrylate strips of protected skin samples after various application times. The flexural surfaces of the forearms of 6 normal volunteers (3 female and 3 male, mean age 26.8 +/- 4.1 years) were treated. The method was as follows: solutions of 5% methylene blue in water and 5% oil red O in ethanol were prepared, and applied to untreated skin and protective-cream-pretreated skin with the aid of aluminum occlusive chambers, for 0 h and 4 h, respectively. At the end of the application time, the creams were removed. Consecutive skin surface biopsies (SSB) from 1 to 4 strips were taken. The amount of stain in each strip was determined by colorimetry, and the cumulative amount of stain from 1 to 4 strips in each measurement was calculated. The cumulative amount represents the amount of permeation of each solution at each time point, and the efficacy of skin barrier cream. The results showed one formulation at both 0 h and 4 h reduced the amount of permeation of methylene blue (p < 0.01) and oil red O (p < 0.01) compared with the control group. Another formulation was protective against the permeation of oil red O (p < 0.01), but not against methylene blue at 0 h and 4 h; it was not significantly different at 0 h versus 4 h. The 3rd formulation produced increased cumulative amounts to oil red O at both 0 h and 4 h (p < 0.05); it also increased permeation amounts to methylene blue (p < 0.05) after 4 h. This model appears a facile, rapid and objective early screen to evaluate the efficacy of skin barrier creams in vivo, as well as their individual ingredients. "

"Abstract: We studied 22 children (mean age: 8.42 years, range: 1.9-15.6 years) with a liver transplant to compare the pharmacokinetics of oral cyclosporine (CsA) microemulsion to the conventional formulation. The CsA treatment (mean dose: 5.9 mg/kg/day, range: 3.0-11.7 mg/kg/day) was converted 1:1 on a milligram-to-milligram basis to the microemulsion formulation. Five days after the conversion, the mean peak blood CsA concentration was higher (microemulsion: 963 ng/ml, range: 518-1864 ng/ml; conventional: 431 ng/ml, range: 98-888 ng/ml; P<0.0001) and it was reached faster (median time of peak concentration: 1.6 hr vs. 2.9 hr, range: 1.0-3.0 hr vs. 1.9-4.0 hr; P=0.0009). The absorption lasted on the average 19% longer after the conventional formulation. The area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) was larger after the microemulsion formulation in all but one patient (P=0.001) by a mean factor of 1.80 (range: 0.72-3.04). The trough CsA level after the microemulsion formulation was more closely related to peak concentration (r2=0.86 vs. 0.45) and AUC (r2=0.84 vs. 0.47); thus, therapeutic drug monitoring may be more useful. After 6 months on the new formulation, the results for the whole group were similar, but in five children the AUC was comparable to the AUC obtained with the conventional formulation. No rejections occurred, and the liver and kidney functions remained unchanged. A 1:1 conversion can be safely performed in children, based on a 6-month follow-up. However, the total drug exposure changes in significant ways, which, on a long-term basis, may improve the immunosuppression in an underimmunosuppressed patient, but may increase the risk for dose-related adverse effects in others.

"Abstract: Considerable interest has been recently generated concerning the use of natural compounds, anti-oxidants in particular, in photoprotection. Two of the best known anti-oxidants are vitamins C and E, both of which have been shown to be somewhat effective in different models of photodamage. Very little has been reported, however, on the effectiveness of a combination of the two (known to be biologically the more relevant situation); nor have there been detailed studies on the ability of these antioxidants to augment commercial sunscreen protection against UV damage. We report that (in swine skin) vitamin C is capable of additive protection against acute UVB damage (sunburn cell formation) when combined with a UVB sunscreen. A combination of both vitamins E and C provided very good protection from a UVB insult, the bulk of the protection attributable to vitamin E. However, vitamin C is significantly better than vitamin E at protecting against a UVA-mediated phototoxic insult in this animal model, while the combination is only slightly more effective than vitamin C alone. When vitamin C or a combination of vitamin C and E is formulated with a commercial UVA sunscreen (oxybenzone), an apparently greater than additive protection is noted against the phototoxic damage. These results confirm the utility of anti-oxidants as photoprotectants but suggest the importance of combining the compounds with known sunscreens to maximize photoprotection. "
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antiemetic efficacy of a modified regimen of oral ondansetron and dexamethasone in patients with lupus nephritis undergoing treatment with cyclophosphamide whose conventional antiemetic regimen had failed. DESIGN: A before-after prospective observational pilot project. SETTING: A federal research hospital. PATIENTS: Fourteen outpatients with lupus nephritis receiving intravenous cyclophosphamide 0.75-1.0 g/m2 had previously experienced chemotherapy-induced emetic events (vomiting or retching) while receiving a standard combination intravenous antiemetic regimen. The regimen consisted of four doses of thiethylperazine 10 mg and diphenhydramine 25 mg every 6 hours, and two doses of lorazepam 0.5 mg every 6 hours starting at 1 hour prior to cyclophosphamide. A subset of 8 patients previously completed a blinded study in which they received the intravenous formulation of ondansetron (4 doses of 4-16 mg q4h) administered orally beginning 30 minutes prior to the cyclophosphamide infusion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of emetic events and cost of drug administration were assessed for the modified ondansetron intervention and compared with those of the standard antiemetic regimen. The incidence of emetic events and visual analog nausea scores for the subset of eight patients were also evaluated. INTERVENTIONS: To account for the delayed onset of emesis associated with cyclophosphamide, patients received both ondansetron 8 mg orally every 4 hours (3 doses) and dexamethasone 10 mg orally (1 dose) beginning 4 hours after the cyclophosphamide infusion. This is different from the manufacturer's recommended dose schedule, in which ondansetron is administered prior to chemotherapy. RESULTS: No emetic events were observed following the administration of oral ondansetron/dexamethasone. The 95% confidence interval for the true rate of emesis was 0% to 19.3%. There was a significant difference in efficacy between ondansetron/dexamethasone and the triple antiemetic regimen (p < 0.0002). None of the patients experienced adverse effects while receiving the ondansetron/dexamethasone regimen. Cost comparisons (including admixture and nursing administration times) for standard combination therapy and oral ondansetron/dexamethasone were $109.09 and $70.24, respectively. No difference in emetic events or nausea ratings was observed between oral ondansetron/dexamethasone tablets and oral administration of ondansetron using the intravenous formula. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that a modified oral ondansetron/dexamethasone regimen is safe and efficacious, and costs less than alternative regimens to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced emesis in patients with lupus nephritis.

"Abstract: Fomblin HC products are a 'family' of high-purity perfluoropolyethers manufactured for barrier cream and other personal care applications which involve direct application to the skin. To confirm the safety of such use, representative Fomblin HC products were tested in experimental animals for acute toxicity, primary and repeated insult irritancy, sensitization and photosensitization, subacute oral toxicity and comedogenicity; mutagenicity was examined in vitro, and irritancy or sensitization was also investigated on human skin (in patch tests with volunteers). A high molecular weight Fomblin HC only was tested in rats for subacute oral toxicity and in man for dermal effects. Single oral doses of 15 g/kg body weight were without evident toxicity to rats, as were single dermal applications or an ip injection at 5 g/kg. No primary irritant action was seen in rabbits or man, and similarly there was no evidence of skin sensitization or photosensitization in guinea pigs, or sensitization in man. No mutagenic action on Salmonella strains of tester bacteria was seen. In repeat dose irritancy or oral toxicity tests in rabbits or rats, no adverse effects of Fomblin HC products were noted; in particular, daily oral administration (1000 mg/kg/day) to rats over 28 days produced no significant reaction. No comedogenic action was found. From the known chemistry of the perfluoropolyethers, the test programme reported here and the limited published data, it is concluded that the intended use of Fomblin HC products in formulations applied to human skin has a high margin of safety.

"Abstract: We investigated the pharmacokinetic profile and the efficacy of ondansetron (day 1) given as 16 mg suppository once a day, as compared with ondansetron 8 mg tablets twice daily, in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. The study was primarily aimed at investigating the pharmacokinetics and was part of a large multinational, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy efficacy trial. Pharmacokinetic data were obtained in a total of 20 patients, 11 of whom had received a suppository containing ondansetron, and nine patients had received the oral formulation. The median area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) obtained with the oral formulation was 226 ng ml-1h-1 (range 91-750), and the median maximum plasma level (Cmax) was 50.5 ng ml-1 (range 24.7-199.6) after a dose of 8 mg. For the ondansetron suppository the median AUC was 140 ng ml-1h-1 range (77-405) and the median Cmax was 17.1 ng ml-1 (range 13-48.3) after a dose of 16 mg. The systemic exposure after correction for the dose difference after the suppository was on average 70% lower than after the tablet. The median time to reach the maximum level (Tmax) was 60 min (range 28-120) with the oral formulation and 209 min (range 90-420) with the suppository. For both the tablet and suppository, there was no apparent relationship between either Cmax or AUC, and efficacy. Although the patient numbers were too small for a formal exposure-response relationship to be derived, the slightly poorer pharmacokinetic performance of the suppository did not appear to be associated with a lessening of control of emesis following chemotherapy. The study demonstrates that the pharmacokinetic analysis of a once-daily 16 mg ondansetron suppository results in appropriate plasma concentrations and AUC, and that this rectal formulation is effective in the protection against nausea and vomiting associated with cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. This formulation will provide a useful alternative to the currently available oral formulation. "
"Abstract: In view of the known problems that diabetic recipients have with drug absorption and of the potential advantages of the microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine (Neoral), 17 previously diabetic recipients of simultaneous pancreas and kidney allografts were studied before and after conversion from Sandimmune (SIM) to Neoral (NEO) formulations of cyclosporine a mean of 4.75 +/- 2.0 years after transplantation. The aims of this study were to determine whether there were changes in the absorption profiles using the 2 formulations and to analyze the safety of conversion from SIM to NEO on a 1:1 ratio. Pharmacokinetic, clinical, and renal function parameters were measured 2 weeks before, and 2 and 4 weeks after conversion. Pharmacokinetics demonstrated that, when taking SIM, only 5 patients had ""good absorption"" (maximal concentration >500 ng/ml and time to maximal concentration < / = 2 hr), but after conversion to NEO, 14 at week +2, and 13 at week +4 were good absorbers (P<0.02 and <0.01, respectively). There was a 50% reduction in the time to maximal blood concentration (from 3.2 +/- 1.9 hr with SIM, to 1.8 +/- 1.3 hr on NEO [P<0.007]) and a 36% increase in trough and a 143% increase (P<0.01) in maximal blood concentrations, although the 9-hr cyclosporine AUC showed an 89% increase (P<0.01). There was an 18% mean reduction in dose per kilogram prescribed 4 weeks after conversion. Renal function, measured by serum creatinine and technecium-99m diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid glomerular filtration rate, was not altered and no adverse events were attributed to NEO. This study confirmed that previously diabetic recipients of simultaneous renal pancreas allografts had variable and poor absorption of cyclosporine using conventional Sandimmune and that this absorption was improved by conversion to Neoral.

"Abstract: Experimental mouthrinses containing 0.4% zinc sulphate and 0.15% triclosan, which differed in base formulations were compared to a commercially available non-active control mouthrinse. Following baseline clinical examinations for plaque, gingival bleeding and calculus, the volunteers were provided with a dental prophylaxis and given oral hygiene instruction, stratified into 3 groups and given 1 of 3 mouthrinses. Further clinical assessments were performed after 4, 16 and 28 weeks. Salivary mutans streptococci were also monitored during the study. At 4 weeks, plaque and calculus scores in all groups were low compared to baseline. During the remainder of the study, these improvements were not maintained and both plaque and calculus levels increased in all groups. Plaque was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than in the control at all time points. Calculus was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than in the control at all time points. Calculus was significantly lower at week 28 for experimental mouthrinse group 2. Gingival bleeding also decreased in the initial 4 weeks but increased thereafter in the control group. In contrast, gingival bleeding was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the two experimental groups than in the control group. No significant changes in mutans streptococci were observed. "
"Abstract: A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter pharmacokinetics study was conducted to compare the clinical safety and tolerability of cyclosporine capsules and oral solution for microemulsion and cyclosporine in 101 primary renal transplant recipients Cyclosporine emulsion has more complete absorption and improved bioavailability compared with cyclosporine, and dosing of both cyclosporine formulations was adjusted to achieve comparable whole-blood trough levels. Mean serum creatinine values were higher in the cyclosporine emulsion group at baseline, 8, and 12 weeks (P<0.05). The incidence of acute rejection was similar in both treatment groups although fewer patients required monoclonal antibody therapy in the cyclosporine group (31% vs. 82%, respectively). Despite the increased bioavailability of cyclosporine emulsion, no significant differences in the incidence of adverse events were observed; the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of cyclosporine emulsion and cyclosporine were comparable.

"Abstract: The oral bioavailability of Sandimmun can be impaired by cholestasis, external biliary diversion, and diarrhea. We report two cases of pediatric liver transplant recipients who experienced chronic rejection and diarrhea secondary to proximal bowel resection. These conditions resulted in poor oral absorption of Sandimmun; the children were converted to the new oral microemulsion formulation Neoral, which significantly improved oral absorption, allowing intravenous cyclosporine weaning and patient discharge. Comparative pharmacokinetic studies were performed in both cases, and the relative Neoral/Sandimmun bioavailabilities were 32.9 and 5.4, respectively. Accordingly, Neoral may constitute to good alternative to ensure the effectiveness of oral cyclosporine administration, particularly in liver-transplanted children with severe cholestasis or shortened small bowel.

"BACKGROUND: Reports of purported sensitization reactions to widely used prescription dermatologicals have raised questions concerning the clinical significance of these reports. The current study was designed to compare irritant and sensitization potentials of such marketed products and to evaluate the risks involved in their usage. METHODS: One hundred and eight healthy adult volunteers were evaluated for primary irritation and hypersensitivity following application under a double-blind paradigm of eight leading prescription dermatologic products and the vehicle cream of one product according to an intensified version of the Shelanski and Shelanski ""Repeated Insult Patch Test."" RESULTS: No clinically significant irritant or sensitization reactions were associated with applications of topical formulations containing clobetasol propionate, doxepin hydrochloride, metronidazole, mupirocin, oxiconazole nitrate, and terbinafine hydrochloride. The doxepin hydrochloride cream vehicle was also found to be nonirritating and nonsensitizing. Both calcipotriene and ketoconazole were moderate irritants and possible sensitization reactions were also associated with ketoconazole. CONCLUSION: Although every topically applied chemical has the potential to cause an adverse response in some individuals, the data obtained in this study for eight commercially available prescription dermatologic products indicate that most are quite safe and have very low risks of clinically significant irritation or sensitization.

"Abstract: Cyclosporin A (CyA) is a good candidate for incorporation in colloidal carriers such as nanoparticles (NP) that would diminish the adverse effects associated with its use under conventional pharmaceutical dosage forms and improve bioavailability after oral administration. In this study a composite rotational experimental design was used to evaluate the joint influence of five formulation variables: temperature of the aqueous phase, needle gauge, volume of the organic phase, and the amounts of polymer and surfactant on the micromeritic characteristics of the CyA-loaded NP obtained by the method of Fessi et al. The percentage of drug encapsulated in the NP was also evaluated for each formulation, and the yield, which was expressed as the ratio between the experimentally measured quantity of drug in the formulation and the theoretical content, was determined because CyA undergoes surface absorption. Potential variables such as stirring speed (500 rpm), final drug concentration (100 micrograms/mL), or injection rates (GRi = 0.379 mL/s) were maintained constant. The ANOVA corresponding to the experimental design showed that the amounts of polymer and surfactant, and the diameter of the needle used in the preparation of NP, significantly affected the percentage of entrapped drug (I2 = 0.8916). The mean particle size was significantly affected by all the formulation variables tested except for the amount of surfactant dissolved in the external aqueous phase (r2 = 0.9518). Neither the yield (mean value of 99.61%) nor the size distribution parameters (polydispersity and coefficient of variation) presented good correlation coefficients for the equations obtained, although some variables showed statistical significance. A second study was carried out to investigate the effects on the drug-loaded NP characteristics of varying the global injection rates (GRi) for the organic phase into the aqueous medium. The results showed a dramatic decrease in both particle size and drug incorporation in the carrier as the rate of mixing increased. From the results of both the experimental design and the second study, a theoretical model for nanoparticle formation is proposed that considers the most significant variables, and an empirical relationship to predict mean particle size is presented. Thus, particle size can be controlled by the injection rates (GRi), the needle gauge, and the polymer concentration. "
"Abstract: Pharmacokinetics of the new galenic formulation of cyclosporin A, Neoral, (Sandoz) was examined in 12 stable young patients after renal transplantation. Six of these patients were tested before and 4 weeks after switching from the standard formulation Sandimmun to Neoral. No significant changes were observed in trough levels, Lmax, Cmax, and AUC0-12 h, but the absorption rate constant (Ka) increased (P = 0.03). Glomerular filtration rate, as assessed by inulin clearance, increased by more than 10% in three patients and decreased in two, and was usually associated with a respective drop and rise in Cmax and AUC0-12 h of cyclosporin A. The large interindividual variability in the response to the conversion to the new formulation points to a need for close monitoring of cyclosporin A trough levels and renal function after switching from Sandimmun to Neoral in this age group in order to avoid nephrotoxicity. "
"Abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relative efficacy of Emla cream (a eutectic formulation of lignocaine and prilocaine) and Bonain's solution (equal amounts of cocaine hydrochloride, menthol and phenol) as local anesthetic agents to the tympanic membrane. Fifty patients undergoing bilateral tympanocentesis were included. The patients were used as their own controls. One tympanic membrane was anesthetized with Emla cream and the other with Bonain's solution. The operating microscope was used. After a 30 min analgesic time, tympanocentesis was performed with aspiration of middle ear secretions. Each patient was then asked to fill in a questionnaire that graded the severity of pain experienced: none, very mild, mild, moderate or severe. Findings showed that Bonain's solution was more effective in tympanocentesis. All patients experienced no pain to very mild pain. With Emla cream 15 of 50 patients experienced mild to moderate pain. No significant side effects occurred with either anesthetic agent. "
"Abstract: Staining of teeth and mucous membranes is a well-known side-effect with chlorhexidine mouthrinses in which dietary chromogens play an important rôle. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a co-polymer anti-adhesive agent would prevent staining by a low concentration chlorhexidine solution. Additionally, the possibility that an essential oil/phenolic rinse product may cause staining was investigated. The rinses studied were the anti-adhesive alone and combined with 0.02% chlorhexidine and the essential oil/phenolic rinse. These were positioned against a positive control rise, 0.2% chlorhexidine, and a negative control rinse, water. The study was a single blind 5-treatment, randomised Latin square cross-over design, incorporating balance for carry-over effects. 15 volunteers participated and on Day 1 of each study period were rendered stain free by scaling and polishing of the teeth. Oral hygiene was suspended and 8 x per day subjects rinsed under supervision, firstly with the allocated formulation and then with 10 ml of warm black tea. On Day 4, tooth and tongue staining was scored by area and intensity (colour). A washout period of at least 3 1/2 days was permitted between treatment periods when oral hygiene was resumed. Before the study and during washouts, volunteers practised tongue brushing. Tooth and tongue staining was significantly increased with 0.2% chlorhexidine compared to the essential oil/phenolic rinse which in turn was significantly increased compared to the other 3 rinses. The antiadhesive/chlorhexidine rinse produced no more staining than the anti-adhesive or water rise. However, the parallel plaque regrowth study suggests this inhibition of staining resulted from the vitiation of the chlorhexidine activity by the antiadhesive. The methodology would appear a simple and quick way of assessing the propensity of mouthrinses to cause extrinsic staining. "
"Abstract: The photodynamic therapy (PDT) activity of the bis(dimethylthexylsiloxy)silicon 2,3-naphthalocyanine (SiNc 8) was evaluated against the EMT-6 tumor implanted intradermally in BALB/c mice. The SiNc 8 was formulated in aqueous emulsions based on Cremophor EL or Solutol HS 15. The formulation was shown to affect plasma clearance and overall pharmacokinetics. Compared to Cremophor, Solutol promoted rapid plasma clearance and high liver retention of the dye, combined with a slight increase of dye tumor concentrations. The PDT action spectrum for tumor response of SiNc 8 in Cremophor (190 mW cm-2, 200 J cm-2, 24 h postinjection [p.i.] of 1 mumol kg-1) showed a maximum at 780 nm, which corresponds to the absorption maximum of the monomeric dye as well as the in vivo maximum change in the ""diffuse optical density"" produced by the dye. The extent of tumor necrosis increased with augmented dye and light doses. Regardless of the formulation, at 1 h p.i. of 0.1 mumol kg-1 SiNc 8, PDT efficiency (190 mW cm-2, 400 J cm-2) was high but accompanied by severe damage to normal tissues, at 24 h p.i. PDT resulted in complete tumor regression in 80% of the animals without adverse effects to adjacent tissues, while at 72 h p.i. PDT induced no tumor response with Cremophor and only a partial response with Solutol. At the latter time point, plasma dye clearance was nearly complete while tumor tissue levels remained high, suggesting that tumor response correlates with plasma rather than tumor dye levels. Skin sensitivity of SKhI mice to solar-simulated radiation was lower with SiNc 8 as compared to Photofrin. Our data suggest the potential of SiNc 8 as a far-red absorbing photosensitizer in clinical PDT. "
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy-safety ratio of a new topical podophyllotoxin cream 0.5% compared with podophyllotoxin solution 0.5% (Condyline) in male patients with genital warts. METHODS: In an observer-blinded controlled study a total of 136 and 133 wart lesions were treated with podophyllotoxin cream 0.5% and podophyllotoxin solution 0.5%, respectively. The preparations were applied twice daily for 3 days, repeated with 4 days intervals for a minimum of two and a maximum of four treatment cycles. RESULTS: At the conclusion of the study (8 weeks after completion of therapy) a significant reduction in mean wart area was observed in both the cream group (87.7, SD 8.4 to 20.6, SD 2.7) and in the solution group (92.3, SD 7.5 to 21.5, SD 2.8) (p < 0.01). At the same time all treated warts had completely cleared in 63% of patients in both study groups. Mild to moderate side effects occurred to the same extent in both podophyllotoxin cream and podophyllotoxin solution recipients. CONCLUSION: We conclude that podophyllotoxin 0.5% administered in a cream formulation does not give additional clinical benefits when compared with podophyllotoxin solution 0.5% in male patients with external genital warts. "
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of a 0.15% and a 0.3% cream formulation of podophyllotoxin in comparison with the 0.5% solution in the treatment of condylomata acuminata and to compare the treatment modalities regarding side effects. DESIGN: The study was designed as an open randomised trial. Ninety male patients with signs of penile HPV infection, with either acuminate or papular lesions, were randomised into three parallel treatment groups. The study medication comprised 0.15% and 0.3% cream and 0.5% solution of podophyllotoxin. The patients treated themselves twice daily for three consecutive days and if total regression of the warts was not achieved after this first treatment cycle, further treatment cycles at 7-day intervals were to be repeated up to a maximum of four treatments. SETTING: The study was carried out in three outpatient clinics: two STD clinics, Department of Dermatology and Venereology, University Hospital (45 patients) and Institut Antoine Fournier, Paris (30 patients), and one military hospital, S1/FO 47/48, Sjukhusenheten, Enköping (15 patients). RESULTS: Statistical evaluation of the treatment effect was based on a ""Response rate"" calculation at each visit. The number of completely responding patients after the first, second, third and fourth cycle were 40 (44%), 61 (68%), 67 (74%) and 70 (78%), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the three treatments after four treatment cycles. However, the 0.15% cream had a significantly slower onset of efficacy as compared with the 0.3% cream and 0.5% solution. Adverse effects were less severe and less frequent with the 0.15% cream than with the other treatment modalities. Severe adverse effects were reported by 12 patients, of whom two were treated with 0.15% cream, five with 0.3% cream and five with 0.5% solution. Thirty-one patients were completely free from adverse effects. CONCLUSION: In this open randomised study with three parallel treatment groups, two cream formulations of 0.15% and 0.3% podophyllotoxin and a 0.5% solution of the same drug all showed an equally good response rate after four treatment cycles. Reported adverse effects were few and mild. The convenience of having different formulations to offer when prescribing treatment for condylomata must be considered. "

"Abstract: Cyclosporin A (CSA) Cyclosporin inhibits IL-2 release and T-cell activation and, secondarily, affects B-cell function. It also inhibits bone resorption, at least in vitro. This drug's bio-availability averages 25-35% but is highly variable. Food and grapefruit juice enhance bio-availability and newer formulations may make its absorption more reliable. It is highly concentrated in fatty tissues and red blood cells but does not cross the blood-brain barrier. CSA is metabolized to numerous metabolites by the liver and its elimination half-life is 6-12 hours in the absence of severe liver disease. Biliary excretion accounts for 94% of CSAs elimination. Because it is highly metabolized, its metabolism can be inhibited by other drugs (e.g. ketoconazole and erythromycin) or its metabolism can be induced (e.g. anticonvulsants). Cyclosporin is more effective than placebo for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and as effective as other antirheumatics. There is potential for the use of CSAs in DMARD combinations. The principal toxicities of cyclosporin are gastro-intestinal and renal, with the latter being of more concern. Leflunomide (LF). Leflunomide may be a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor, although tyrosine kinase inhibitor may also be part of its mechanism of action. Its active metabolite is excreted renally to a large degree, with a prolonged elimination half-life of about 11 days. Since LF is activated by liver metabolism, renal failure may have less effect on kinetics than severe liver disease. Early data on efficacy indicate efficacy at 10-25 mg/day, although more well-controlled data is necessary. Toxicity relates to the skin, liver and GI tract, although some degree of weight loss was also found. Nitrogen mustard (NM). Nitrogen mustard is an alkylating agent whose pharmacokinetics are poorly understood. Small, open studies in RA indicate that NM has a potential for relatively rapid response (1-2 weeks) but, clearly, much work remains to be done. As an alkylating agent, GI and hematological toxicities are of greatest concern. "
"Abstract: The microemulsion-based formulation of cyclosporin (Neoral; referred to as the microemulsion formulation in this review) is a microemulsion preconcentrate which has been developed to overcome problems associated with the poor and unpredictable absorption of the standard oral formulation of this drug. These include marked intra- and interpatient variability in the extent of absorption, a poor correlation between trough blood concentrations of cyclosporin and total systemic exposure, and the need for regular monitoring of blood cyclosporin concentrations. In healthy volunteers and renal or liver transplant recipients, administration of the microemulsion formulation resulted in cyclosporin absorption which was significantly faster, more extensive and more predictable than that seen with the standard oral formulation. Furthermore, measurement of whole-blood trough cyclosporin concentrations provided a better estimate of systemic drug exposure in renal transplant recipients who received the microemulsion formulation than in those who received the standard formulation. Systemic exposure of cyclosporin delivered by the new formulation appears to be relatively unaffected by food intake. Initial data suggest that drug absorption from the microemulsion formulation is enhanced in comparison with that achieved from the standard formulation in liver transplant recipients undergoing biliary diversion or with cholestasis, although absorption from the new formulation does not appear to be completely independent of bile. Preliminary results from other groups that experience cyclosporin malabsorption from the standard formulation (patients with cystic fibrosis or diabetes, and children) are also encouraging. Clinical trials specifically designed to investigate the relative immunosuppressive efficacy of the microemulsion formulation have not been reported; further data are required to fully establish the relationship between the more rapid and extensive absorption of cyclosporin from the microemulsion formulation and the probability of graft rejection or adverse events (including nephrotoxicity and hypertension). However, no statistically significant differences have been noted between the 2 formulations in the incidence of these events in studies to date. The incidence of rejection in new renal or liver transplant recipients treated for a minimum of 3 months was approximately 31 to 50% in those receiving the microemulsion formulation and approximately 24 to 56% in those receiving the standard formulation. Thus, although confirmation of existing efficacy and tolerability data is required, the characteristic pharmacokinetic properties of the microemulsion formulation make it an attractive option for the oral delivery of cyclosporin in transplant recipients, offering more predictable and more extensive drug absorption than the standard formulation. The microemulsion formulation may be of particular benefit in patients who show poor absorption of cyclosporin from the standard oral formulation, such as liver transplant recipients with biliary diversion or cholestasis.

"Abstract: Sulfur mustard bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide (HD) is a bifunctional alkylating agent that causes cutaneous vesication. The isolated perfused porcine skin flap is an in vitro model that has been used to study this toxic response. The purpose of this study was to formulate a toxicokinetic model of HD penetration and cutaneous disposition as an aid in correlating critical steps in the pathogenesis of vesication to HD concentrations in different regions of skin. [14C]HD was dosed topically in ethanol at 10.0 mg/ml in a 7.5-cm2 dosing site and venous efflux samples were collected over 2, 4, or 8 hr. At the termination of the experiment, stratum corneum tape strips, core biopsies for serial sections, and the entire skin flap were collected for radioassay. Peak 14C-radiolabel flux occurred within 5 to 60 min in all skin flaps, much earlier than signs of HD-induced toxicity. A toxicokinetic model was used to quantitate the time profile of HD disposition in different skin compartments. Estimates of vascular and extracellular volume changes due to topical HD toxicity were estimated using radiolabeled albumin and inulin infusions. A second toxicokinetic model, with a time-variant distribution rate, was used to simulate volume changes. In order to accurately predict HD disposition, it was necessary to add another compartment as a reservoir for slowly released metabolites of HD. This model provides a quantitative profile of the time course of HD (or metabolites) disposition within skin which would aid in the interpretation of mechanistic studies of vesication as well as in designing interventive antivesicant drug strategies.

"Abstract: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of once-daily with twice-daily application of a 0.05% cream formulation of fluticasone propionate in the treatment of atopic eczema in adults and children. Two hundred and seventy patients with moderate to severe atopic eczema were enrolled in the study, and randomized to receive either once-daily or twice-daily fluticasone propionate 0.05% cream for 4 weeks. Patients randomized to the once-daily group also received the vehicle cream to ensure that the study remained blinded. The clinical response of a preselected target area of affected skin was assessed by investigators at weekly intervals and compared with the baseline. Analysis of the investigators' overall assessment of the response of the target area for both the 'intent-to-treat' population and the per protocol population showed that 79-85% of patients were judged a clinical success. For both populations, there was no statistically significant difference between the response to once-daily and twice-daily active treatment (intent-to-treat; P = 0.35; 95% confidence interval for difference -14.2 to +5.0 percentage points: per protocol; P = 0.42; 95% confidence interval for difference -14.7 to +6.2 percentage points.) The improvement in the signs and symptoms was judged a success in 95-97% of patients. There was an equal reduction in severity scores for disease activity in both groups, and the speed of symptom relief was similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) "
"Abstract: The plant-derived insecticide, alpha-terthienyl was prepared by synthesis as 3',4'-di[14C]-alpha-terthienyl for pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies. When administered orally to rats at a single dose of 50 mg/kg, excretion of the labelled material was maximal one day after administration and declined to no measurable quantities by day 4. Two metabolites [1,4-di(2'-thienyl)1,4-butadione and 2-2'-bithiophene-5-carboxylic acid] and trace quantities of the parent material were isolated from the urine and chemically identified. These represent the first metabolites of alpha-terthienyl identified. In pilot acute and subacute trials, unlabelled alpha-terthienyl was non-toxic when administered orally to rats as the ""ready to use"" formulation (0.1% active ingredient). The pure compound had an LD50 of 110 mg/kg when administered intraperitoneally to rats. The results suggest that there is considerable separation with respect to mosquito larvae and non-target mammal sensitivity. "
"OBJECTIVE: To answer and comment on a number of controversial issues in relation to osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), including: Is osteoporosis an extra-articular manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis? Does periarticular osteoporosis reflect disease activity in early arthritis? Is there a threshold for corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis? Can anti-resorbing drugs prevent rheumatoid arthritis progression? Are stress fractures rare in rheumatoid arthritis Is methotrexate toxic for bone? METHODS: Confrontation of current literature and our own experience in order to formulate a general opinion. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Because most studies agree that osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men with RA is more evident at the hip and radius than at the spine, and that the most important determinants of bone loss are disability, local disease activity and cumulative corticosteroid dose, osteoporosis is not a common systemic extra-articular manifestation of RA. In early arthritis, periarticular osteoporosis does indeed reflect disease activity because it is closely related to the acute phase reactants, but once periarticular osteoporosis is established it is no longer a marker of disease activity. The threshold does for corticosteroid-induced osteoporotic fractures is the cumulative rather than the actual dose. Statements based on quantitative computed tomography concerning the acute effects (and their reversal) of corticosteroids on bone have to be interpreted with care because of important body composition changes, in particular in bone marrow fat, during corticosteroid treatment. At present there is no evidence that anti-resorbing drugs can change the progress of RA erosions, probably because erosions are the result of non-osteoclast mediated mechanisms. Stress fractures in RA are underdiagnosed and are often confused with synovitis, and therefore it is likely that they are more frequent than commonly thought, in particular at the lower limbs. Methotrexate osteopathy is known in oncological practice. Whether low dose methotrexate is toxic for bone is not clear, but a number of clinical observations suggest that the occurrence of spontaneous fractures and lower extremity pain is more frequent in methotrexate treated patients than expected. Prospective studies are necessary to confirm these impressions. "
"Abstract: The efficacy and pharmacokinetic profiles of two oral formulations of cyclosporine A (Sandimmune and Neoral; Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ) were evaluated in 37 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in a randomized, double-blind, modified, crossover study. Cyclosporine A (150 mg twice daily), administered in either formulation, reduced the severity of plaque lesions: 94% of all patients reported at least moderate improvement and 70% reported complete clearing. Approximately 2 weeks of therapy were required for drug exposure to stabilize on either formulation. Cyclosporine A exposure from Neoral was significantly greater relative to that from Sandimmune across all study weeks. At the eighth week (before crossover), AUC and Cmax values for Neoral and Sandimmune were 5618 +/- 1705 versus 3202 +/- 596 ng.h/mL and 1283 +/- 337 versus 623 +/- 173 ng/mL, respectively. In crossover analysis at steady state, the relative oral bioavailability of cyclosporine from the Neoral formulation was 54% greater than that from Sandimmune. Some pharmacokinetic parameters showed less variability both between and within groups of patients taking Neoral versus Sandimmune. Both formulations were well tolerated, in that most adverse events were of mild severity. "
"Abstract: Use of cyclosporin A (CsA) in transplantation medicine has been shown to cause a number of toxic cellular side effects, which has prompted a search for formulations that afford protection from these undesirable sequelae. Previously we demonstrated that fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) can reverse a variety of toxic cellular effects that arise upon use of various chemical agents. The present studies were undertaken to study the effects of CsA on rat myocardial Ca2+, calmodulin (Cam)-dependent enzymes such as Ca2+ ATPase and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and the role of FDP in attenuating these changes in vitro. Rat ventricular sarcoplasmic Ca2+ ATPase was studied by measuring the inorganic phosphorous liberated on ATP hydrolysis and rat heart 100,000 g fraction NOS activity by monitoring the formation of [3H]-citrulline in the presence of 10-1000 microM CsA and 1000 microM CsA + 1000 microns FDP in vitro. CsA in all concentrations significantly (P < 0.001) inhibited both Ca2+ ATPase and NOS activities of rat myocardium and FDP at 1000 microM concentration completely reversed the 1000 microM CsA-inhibited Ca2+ ATPase and cNOS activities of rat myocardium. These data indicate that CsA may inhibit Ca2+ ATPase and NOS activities in the rat myocardium through interference with its Ca2+/Cam-mediated events and thus may cause myocardial toxicity. FDP may reverse these changes. "
"Abstract: 1. Less than 5% of a dose of the conventional oral formulation of cyclosporin, Sandimmun, is absorbed in liver transplant recipients with external biliary drainage, necessitating intravenous administration of the drug and exposing the patient to increased risk of severe side-effects. 2. We compared the pharmacokinetics of the conventional oral formulation of cyclosporin with that of the new microemulsion formulation, Neoral, in eight liver transplant recipients with external biliary diversion. Patients were maintained on a continuous infusion of cyclosporin until steady-state conditions had been achieved. They were then given a test dose (10 mg kg-1) of either the conventional or microemulsion formulation (randomised order) followed by the same dose of the other formulation. Parent cyclosporin concentrations were measured in whole blood samples collected at timed intervals over the 24 h after the oral doses and pharmacokinetic parameters calculated. 3. The bioavailability of cyclosporin from the microemulsion formulation was, on average, 6.5-fold (95% C.I. 1.9 to 11.1-fold) greater than that of the conventional formulation, indicating the improved absorption characteristics of the new oral microemulsion formulation during external bile drainage. 4. A significant negative correlation was found between the external bile drainage volume and bioavailability of cyclosporin from the microemulsion formulation (r = -0.8; P = 0.016), suggesting that variability in cyclosporin absorption from the microemulsion formulation may still be at least partly attributable to bile- dependence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) "
"Abstract: The present study deals with attempts to deliver cyclosporin A into the deeper skin and some of the fundamental reasons why this proves so difficult. Because of different physicochemical requirements for the solution and activity of cyclosporin A and the enhancer, n-decylmethyl sulfoxide, it was hard to demonstrate increases in permeation of cyclosporin A by the enhancer in either aqueous or ethanol/water formulation. Cyclosporin A was prohibitively insoluble in aqueous media and the activity of the enhancer is diminished to ineffectiveness when it is applied in alcoholic media. However, n-decylmethyl sulfoxide action on the stratum corneum could be obtained by pretreating the skin. The effect of pretreatment with this compound on the permeation of cyclosporin A through hairless mouse skin and human skin was studied with side-by-side diffusion cells. The skin was pretreated with 10 mM n-decylmethyl sulfoxide for various durations. Cyclosporin A in an ethanol/water formulation was then placed in the donor cell, with the amount of ethanol being controlled to maintain the highest possible thermodynamic activity. Accumulations of cyclosporin A in receiver cell media, aqueous or ethanol/water, were then assessed. Permeation from two different concentrations of cyclosporin A was compared. The permeability of hairless mouse skin to cyclosporin A was increased by the pretreatment, but results with human skin were more equivocal. It appears that it will take very long pretreatments to ready human skin for topical cyclosporin A therapy. "
"Abstract: Leaves of Baphia nitida are used in folk medicine for the treatment of inflamed and infected umbilical cords in Nigeria. Phytochemical analysis of the leaves detected tannins, flavonoids and saponin glycosides. Flavonoid rich fraction of the leaf, obtained by a chromatographic process, was formulated into an ointment and tested at 3 dose levels for anti-inflammatory activity against croton oil and heat induced inflammation on ears of mice and depilated backs of rats, respectively. Both provide evidence for the ability of this fraction to inhibit the inflammatory condition on the rodents. The activity was found to be dose related, and the mouse ear model was found to be the more sensitive of the two tests used. Hydrocortisyl cream used as a positive control reference was significantly active in both systems. These results provide a scientific basis for the traditional use of the leaves of Baphia nitida as an anti-inflammatory agent. "
"Abstract: Ointment formulations of reactive topical skin protectants (rTSPs) or topical skin protectants (TSPs) based on perfluorinated polyether material (PFPE, i.e., fomblin RT-15) were prepared and spin labeled. Four N-oxyl-4-4'-dimethyloxazolidine derivatives of stearic acid, 5-NS, 7-NS, 12-NS, and 16-NS, were used as spin probes. The spin-labeled vehicle, fomblin-RT-15, and vehicle containing chloroamide (S-330, an antivesicant) were exposed to various concentrations of half-mustard gas. The order parameter (S) was dependent on the depth of penetration of the paramagnetic group into the vehicle (fomblin) and on the chemical composition of the reactive antivesicant under investigation. The net change of the viscosity of the vehicle and the chemical composition were seen to affect the penetration profile. This will provide a useful in vitro screening technique to develop antivesicant TSPs. "
"Abstract: Facial swelling is a common presenting sign of the dental emergency patient. The most common etiology of the swelling is odontogenic infection, whereupon the dental practitioner begins his intraoral examination in order to assess, diagnose and ultimately treat the source of the swelling. In many cases the examination is academic, as the causative tooth sticks out like the proverbial 'sore thumb.' Other times the source of the swelling is not so clear cut, and the practitioner must formulate a differential diagnosis in order to accurately deal with the pathology. It is vital that all information be accurately assessed prior to diagnosis and treatment. The etiology of facial swelling may be infectious, traumatic or neoplastic. "
"Abstract: Topical benzoyl peroxide has been used in the treatment of acne for over 30 years, with no reports of adverse effects that could be related to skin carcinogenesis. Two case-control epidemiological studies have found a lack of association between the specific use of benzoyl peroxide and skin cancer. In addition to these findings in humans, 23 carcinogenicity studies in rodents with benzoyl peroxide, including 16 employing topical application, have yielded negative results. An increase in skin carcinomas was reported in 1 study in which benzoyl peroxide in acetone was applied to the skin of SENCAR mice for a 1-year period; however, this study did not employ adequate control groups to fully understand the unusual findings, and the results were inconsistent with those of 6 other similar studies. While benzoyl peroxide is not a complete carcinogen in animals and has weak or no mutagenic potential, it has been found to be a tumor promoter in mouse skin using experimental two-stage models of carcinogenesis. Consistently positive results have been obtained in tumor promotion studies in which SENCAR mice were exposed to initiating doses of potent experimental carcinogens followed by promotion with benzoyl peroxide in acetone. Negative results have been obtained in similar studies with commercial formulations. However, the results of promotion studies with benzoyl peroxide do not carry significant weight for human safety assessment as evidenced by (i) the absence of demonstrated carcinogenicity in humans of a number of rodent tumor promoters despite long-term human exposure; (ii) the observation that tumor promotion in mouse skin occurs only under specific experimental conditions and predominantly in highly sensitive strains; (iii) clinical use scenarios markedly different from the conditions resulting in tumor promotion in mouse skin; and (iv) the significant physiological differences between mouse and human skin. Thus, to date, available scientific evidence does not allow the results of these rodent promotion studies to be meaningfully applied to human safety assessment. As such, significant scientific progress must be made before human safety estimations can be derived from rodent promotion data.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "
"Abstract: Guidelines for the use of cyclosporin in patients with rheumatoid arthritis have been formulated as a result of 2 International Consensus meetings. Clinical experience since the last meeting in June 1994 indicates that the clear and simple recommended guidelines remain valid. Experience in early identification of patients with a poor prognosis is growing, and trials currently underway will provide further evidence regarding the use of cyclosporin earlier in the course of severe disease. Confirmation of the potential benefits of the microemulsion-based formulation of cyclosporin (Neoral) relative to the conventional formulation (Sandimmun) will further strengthen the position of the drug in the management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. "
"Abstract: While cyclosporin has an established role in the management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, its use can be accompanied by various adverse events. In daily practice, the potential for cyclosporin to induce nephropathy is of most concern and has, to some extent, limited the use of this drug. However, these effects on renal function are dose dependent. Two international meetings have resulted in the publication of guidelines aimed at limiting the risk of adverse events when cyclosporin is used in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The 1994 International Consensus guidelines with respect to renal safety recommend the principal dosage regimen of 'go low, go slow', which requires starting patients on a daily dose of between 2.5 and 3.5 mg/kg with the maximum daily dose not exceeding 5 mg/kg. The cyclosporin dosage chosen should be titrated against the highest acceptable increase in serum creatinine, i.e. a 30% increase over the baseline value. Renal biopsy data support these guidelines, and when the latter are followed by physicians, it is very unlikely that histological damage will occur. The new oral microemulsion-based formulation of cyclosporin (Neoral) has a more predictable absorption and a 20% greater bioavailability than the conventional formulation (Sandimmun). Therefore, the microemulsion formulation may enable more patients to receive effective treatment at lower doses. This could have interesting safety and pharmacoeconomic implications. "
"Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic immune-mediated disease characterised by an inflammatory synovitis and extra-articular manifestations. There is an expanding body of evidence to indicate that the activation of T lymphocytes is central in the initiation and perpetuation of this disease. Cyclosporin is an immunomodulator and a highly specific inhibitor of T-lymphocyte function, and has demonstrated disease-modifying properties in clinical studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A concern with the use of cyclosporin has been the development of dose-dependent adverse effects, in particular renal dysfunction. Cyclosporin is lipophilic by nature and the conventional oral formulation (Sandimmun) was subject to incomplete and highly variable absorption, resulting in substantial inter- and intrasubject variations in peak concentrations and systemic bioavailability. A microemulsion-based formulation of cyclosporin (Neoral) has recently been developed, and possesses more predictable and improved absorption with a consequent increased peak concentration and systemic bioavailability. The improved predictability of absorption, and hence blood concentrations, facilitates the ability to 'tailor' therapy to an individual patient, which, in theory, could translate into an improved efficacy and safety profile.

"Abstract: A rat animal model was used for comparing the photodynamic efficacy of two formulations of topically administered Photofrin in the uterus: 0.7 mg/kg Photofrin and 0.7 mg/kg Photofrin + 4% Azone, a penetration-enhancing agent. Uterine structure and reproductive performance were evaluated following illumination with 80 J/cm2 of 630 nm light. Fluorescence microscopy was employed to determine drug localization in frozen uterine sections at various times after drug administration. Functionality studies demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of implantations per treated uterine horn compared to controls. The mean number of implantations decreased systematically on increasing the interval between Photofrin administration and light application. At 72 h, 0.88 +/- 0.52 gestational sacs per rat were recorded with Photofrin therapy, compared with 8.1 +/- 1.12 (P = 0.01) on the untreated side, indicating nearly complete loss of reproductive capability. Similar results were achieved after only 3 h treatment with Photofrin + Azone (0.38 +/- 0.26 sacs per rat versus 7.5 +/- 1.07 on the untreated side; P = 0.01). This indicates that the effect of Photofrin can be enhanced either by extending the drug incubation period from 3 to 72 h or by adding the penetration-enhancing drug Azone. Fluorescence pharmacokinetic studies suggest that both forms of topically administered Photofrin are diffusely distributed throughout the endometrium at virtually the same rate. However, Azone may enhance the selectivity of photodynamic therapy by facilitating drug targeting to critical endometrial structures. "
"Abstract: Type of diet influences toxic effects of the chemotherapeutic drug methotrexate (MTX) on the gastrointestinal tract (GI) tract. In this study, commercial enteral products containing various protein types were tested to determine whether they exacerbated or alleviated MTX-induced GI toxicity in a non-tumor-bearing animal model receiving a single injection of MTX (20 mg/kg). Five enteral products containing casein or soy isolate in various forms as the primary source of protein were used. One casein-based product also contained soy fiber. These diets were compared with a soy concentrate-based diet and a casein-based diet prepared by the authors. Each diet was fed to 10 rats for seven days before injection and seven days after injection. In animals fed soy isolate or hydrolyzed or intact casein without added soy fiber, food intake was < 30% of pre-MTX injection levels on Days 3 and 4 after injection. These animals also lost weight and had diarrhea. Rats consuming the casein-based diet with fiber experienced some protection against MTX toxicity. Food intake only dropped to 63% of preinjection levels, weight was maintained, and no diarrhea occurred. Rats fed soy concentrate maintained food intake above 90% of preinjection levels, which was greater than all other groups at Day 3 and those receiving hydrolyzed or intact casein without fiber on Day 4 (p < 0.05). Weight gain in the soy concentrate group was also different from that in groups fed hydrolyzed or intact casein without fiber (p < 0.05). Rats consuming soy concentrate had no diarrhea. A second experiment was conducted to evaluate histological damage to the intestine when these diets were fed to animals injected with MTX. This experiment was conducted in the same manner as the first experiment, except animals were sacrificed on Day 3 after injection and samples were obtained from the jejunum. Crypt necrosis occurred in all groups except those consuming the soy concentrate diet or the enteral product containing soy fiber. Results indicate that soy concentrate is superior in alleviating MTX toxicity compared with commercial enteral products. "
"Abstract: The aims of the study were (1) to compare the anticaries efficacy of a silica abrasive dentifrice containing 0.24% NaF and 0.3% triclosan/2.0% copolymer with a similar dentifrice without the triclosan/copolymer and (2) to study any disturbance of the oral mucosa associated with the test formulation. A double-blind, random, unsupervised, 30-month longitudinal clinical trial was conducted on 3,462 children who were initially 11-13 years of age. Two trained and calibrated dentists each examined approximately half the children. Examinations were undertaken at baseline, 15 months and 30 months. No significant differences were found between the DFS or DFT mean increments for the two dentifrice groups after 15 or 30 months. At 30 months the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of the mean increments satisfied the ADA criteria for equivalence. It is concluded that a 0.24% NaF/silica abrasive dentifrice containing 0.3% triclosan/2.0% copolymer is equivalent in its anticaries efficacy to a similar dentifrice without the addition of triclosan/copolymer. No side effects attributable to the test or control dentifrices were observed at any time during the study. "
"Abstract: Potential differences in the acute effect of cyclosporin on renal function when dosed orally as the current market formulation or following a milligram-to-milligram conversion to a new microemulsion formulation were investigated in 14 stable kidney transplant patients. The study consisted of three sequential periods of 2 weeks duration each. Patients entered (period I) and completed (period III) the investigation with the market formulation and received the microemulsion formulation in period II; individualized cyclosporin doses remained unchanged throughout the study. Over one steady-state dosing interval at the end of each study period, whole blood cyclosporin pharmacokinetic profiles were assessed in parallel with endogenous creatinine clearances over sequential 1- to 2-h intervals. The rate and extent of cyclosporin absorption were significantly greater (P < 0.01) from the microemulsion formulation with average increases of 73% in peak concentration and 44% in area under the curve compared to the market formulation. Sequential creatinine clearances exhibited a transient decrease with the nadir occurring on average between 4 and 6 h post dose followed by a rapid return to baseline. Specifically in period I on the market formulation, clearances decreased from a baseline of 71.7 +/- 20.6 to a minimum of 51.1 +/- 17.9 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (similar values in period III) and from 76.8 +/- 24.8 to 53.5 +/- 17.5 ml/min 1.73 m2 in period II on the microemulsion. Neither the baseline nor minimum clearances were significantly different among the study periods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) "
"Abstract: This international, multicenter clinical trial was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of two different formulations of ketotifen: Zaditen SRO and Zaditen Standard Form. In a randomized double-blind study over a 12-week treatment period, 3 parallel groups of asthmatic subjects received Zaditen SRO (2 mg once daily), Zaditen SRO (4 mg once daily), or Zaditen Standard Form (1 mg twice daily). Asthmatic subjects (362 evaluable cases, aged 6-29 years) kept daily records of clinical symptoms, use of concomitant medication, and peak flow recordings and were examined at 2-week intervals up to the end of the study. Zaditen SRO 4 mg administered once a day at night showed a statistically significant faster onset of action and was more clinically effective than Zaditen Standard Form. The Zaditen SRO 4-mg and 2-mg formulations were at least as well tolerated as the standard form, with somnolence occurring equally after both formulations. In conclusion, Zaditen SRO (4 mg once daily) was found to be equally safe and more effective in the prophylactic treatment of mild and moderate bronchial asthma than Zaditen Standard Form (1 mg twice daily).

"Abstract: The clinical outcome of 23 patients with high grade diffuse large cell immunoblastic lymphoma (Working Formulation, category H) treated by an intensive shortened schedule regimen of chemotherapy is described. Alternating cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, bleomycin and prednisolone, and ifosfamide, etoposide and methotrexate were given over an 18-week (range 16.0-20.8) period. External beam radiotherapy was administered as consolidation therapy to sites of original bulky disease in 17 patients. Treatment was well tolerated, though there were two toxic deaths. A 90% response rate was obtained. Sixteen of 18 patients followed for a minimum of 36 months are alive and in complete remission, representing a disease free survival of 69.5%; two further patients are alive following autologous bone marrow transplant. The 3-year disease free survival was 73% (+/- 9%) and the overall 3-year survival 78% (+/- 9%). "

"OBJECTIVE: The authors determined whether bombesin could improve survival from methotrexate (MTX)-induced enterocolitis. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Bombesin prevents gut mucosal atrophy, which is produced by feeding rats an elemental diet. Administration of MTX produces a lethal enterocolitis in rats fed an elemental diet. METHODS: On treatment day 0, 60 rats were divided randomly into three groups and fed an elemental diet (Vivonex TEN, Sandoz, Minneapolis, MN) as the only source of nutrition. Groups were subdivided further to receive either saline or bombesin (10 micrograms/kg, subcutaneously, three times a day) beginning either on day 0 or day 14. Methotrexate (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) was given to all rats 14 days after the start of an elemental diet. RESULTS: Bombesin prevented the mucosal atrophy in the ileum produced by the elemental diet and significantly decreased mortality in rats given MTX (whether given as a pretreatment or at the time of MTX administration). CONCLUSION: Bombesin significantly improved survival in a lethal model of MTX-induced enterocolitis, possibly by maintaining gut mucosal structure. Administration of bombesin to patients receiving chemotherapy may be clinically useful in preventing the severe enterocolitis induced by various chemotherapeutic agents. "
"Abstract: The steady-state pharmacokinetics and tolerability of a microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine (Sandimmune Neoral) were compared with the commercial formulation (Sandimmune) in 55 clinically stable renal allograft recipients. In study period I (2 weeks' duration), patients entered the study on a stable, individualized twice-daily dosage regimen of the commercial formulation. In period II (2 weeks), they were changed over to the microemulsion formulation at the same dose as at study entry. In period III (2 weeks), dose titration was subsequently allowed if necessary to provide comparable steady-state trough concentrations as at study entry. The commercial formulation was reinstituted during period IV (2 weeks). Safety and tolerability were assessed at weekly clinic visits, and the steady-state pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine in whole blood were characterized at the end of each study period. A milligram-to-milligram dose conversion was adequate when making the initial change between formulations in order to maintain steady-state trough concentrations in the target therapeutic range. Concomitant with this conversion, the steady-state peak concentration and area under the curve increased on average by 59% and 30%, respectively, due to absorption-related differences between the formulations. These increases were not associated with an increase in adverse experiences or changes in blood pressure or clinical laboratory parameters over the first four weeks after the change-over. Trough concentrations were more stable and were more strongly correlated with systemic exposure (area under the curve) during treatment with the microemulsion formulation. Intraindividual coefficients of variation in steady-state peak concentration, time to attain the peak, area under the curve, and percent peak-trough fluctuation ranged from 18% to 74% from the commercial formulation. Variability from the microemulsion formulation was significantly less, ranging from 10% to 22%. "
"Abstract: An improved human model for the quantification of skin barrier creams (BCs) is described. In contrast to the previously published procedure, the back, instead of the forearm, and a total of 4 irritants are used. Due to the larger area, 3 BC formulations can be simultaneously compared to the control field, which receives the irritant only, without BC-pretreatment. On 10 human volunteers, the irritants 10% sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), 1% sodium hydroxide (NaOH), 30% lactic acid (LA) and undiluted toluene (TOL) were applied via large Finn Chambers for 30 min, 5 x during the 1st week and 4 x during the 2nd week. Taktosan Salbe (water-in-oil emulsion) and RAWI Speerschutzcreme (oil-in-water emulsion) were applied 30 min before contact with the irritants. In order to assess reproducibility and interindividual variation, the BC RAWI was tested in duplicate. Irritant cutaneous reactions were quantified by 4 parameters: erythema score, transepidermal water loss, blood flow volume and stratum corneum hydration by measuring capacitance. The results showed marked differences in efficacy. Taktosan significantly suppressed irritation by SLS, NaOH and LA, which was apparent in nearly all parameters. RAWI caused significant inhibition of SLS irritation, and a positive trend against NaOH and LA was observed. Both BCs failed against TOL. The results of duplicate testing with RAWI showed good reproducibility. The dogma that oil-in-water emulsions are primarily effective against lipophilic irritants, and water-in-oil emulsions against hydrophilic irritants, needs to be re-evaluated on the basis of our findings. This model seems to have potential for further studies on BCs and might elucidate the complex interaction of BCs with irritants. "
"Abstract: Irritation of upper respiratory tract (sensory irritation) due to two model solvents, ethylbenzene and propanol, were investigated from their reflex-induced decrease in respiratory rate in mice. Intranasal application of capsaicin decreased the sensory irritation response of both solvents, indicating that at least part of the sensory irritation effect must occur as a result of activation of capsaicin sensitive afferent nerves. The vehicle used for the application of capsaicin in itself decreased the respiratory rate strongly, either caused by effects on the upper respiratory tract or on the lungs. This demonstrates the need for a formulation of a pharmacologically inactive vehicle for nasal application of lipophilic substances. Pretreatment with indomethacin had no influence on sensory irritation of any of the solvents. This suggests that sensory irritation is caused by a direct interaction between receptors on the trigeminal nerves and the vapours rather than being an indirect effect of tissue damage giving rise to metabolites from the cyclooxygenase pathway. "
"Abstract: We investigated the in vivo effect of cyclosporin A (CsA) on mouse thymus and thymocytes. Administration of CsA (10 mg/kg of body weight) was found to induce a marked reduction in the size, weight and consistency of the thymus. These modifications were associated with thymic reticulo-epithelial cells (TREC) and thymocyte damage. Some of the damaged thymocytes displayed characteristic of cells undergoing apoptosis. Ultrastructural study of thymocytes and thymic tissue, as well as DNA electrophoresis of thymocytes, showed chromatin condensation, cellular shrinkage, and nuclear fragmentation in oligonucleosomal fragments. DNA labeling with propidium iodide (PI) of thymocytes from CsA treated mice cultured for 24 hrs showed an increased number of apoptotic nuclei. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for thymocyte subsets confirmed that CsA induces a large decrease in the relative number of mature single positive (SP) CD4+CD8- and CD8+CD4- thymocytes expressing high densities of CD3 and T cell receptor ab (TCR alpha beta) surface molecules, but also a decrease in the absolute number of the other thymocyte subsets. These results suggest that CsA causes macroscopic and ultrastructural modifications of the thymus, associated with an active process of cell death in mouse thymocytes in vivo. In line with these results we formulate a hypothesis concerning the stage of T-cell development at which CsA induces apoptosis. "
"PURPOSE: The aim of our study was to compare in a multicentric randomized trial two regimens widely used in the treatment of advanced-stage intermediate- to high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and to assess whether a third-generation regimen (methotrexate with leucovorin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin [MACOP-B]) was superior to a second-generation regimen (procarbazine, methotrexate with leucovorin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide [ProMACE-MOPP]). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1987 and August 1991, 221 patients with diffuse intermediate- to high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Working Formulation groups F, G, H, and K), stage II bulky (> 10 cm), III, or IV, were randomized by the Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Cooperative Study Group (NHLCSG) to receive ProMACE-MOPP for six cycles or MACOP-B for 12 weeks. Survival, progression-free survival, and disease-free survival were determined, and multivariate analysis of prognostic factors was performed. RESULTS: In the two groups of patients, there was no significant difference in terms of complete remission (CR) rate (49.1% with ProMACE-MOPP and 52.3% with MACOP-B), 3-year overall survival rate (45.2% with PROMACE-MOPP and 52.3% with MACOP-B), and 3-year progression-free survival rate (36.4% with ProMACE-MOPP and 36.1% with MACOP-B). In terms of toxicity, no significantly greater toxicity occurred in either arm. Overall toxicity was acceptable. The most frequent side effects were grade II through IV leukopenia, infection, mucositis, and anemia. Treatment-related deaths were equally distributed. CONCLUSION: No significant differences in terms of efficacy and/or toxicity between ProMACE-MOPP and MACOP-B are evident. These results are consistent with recent randomized trials showing that the new-generation aggressive regimens are no better than previous ones. "
"Abstract: Coal tar, a tumour initiator, and dithranol, a tumour promoter, are used in the treatment of psoriasis. Topical treatment of mice with pharmaceutical formulations of these two agents, at therapeutic doses, induced skin papillomas in a classical two-stage carcinogenesis protocol, while treatment with either agent alone did not. This finding has implications for the use of both agents in combination in the treatment of psoriasis. "
"BACKGROUND: Psoriasis vulgaris may benefit from treatment with fumaric acid and/or its derivatives; however, because different preparations have been used, results have been contradictory and difficult to interpret. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate the therapeutic value of fumaric acid derivatives. METHODS: A randomized double-blind study was carried out in patients with psoriasis, comparing a well-characterized formulation of fumaric acid derivatives with placebo. RESULTS: The results indicated statistically significant superiority of the fumaric acid derivatives over placebo. Adverse events (flush, gastrointestinal disturbances) were initially relatively frequent, but decreased thereafter. CONCLUSION: Fumaric acid derivatives were found to be effective and safe in the treatment of psoriasis. "
"Abstract: Most antihistamines are assumed to possess a more or less pronounced sedative potential in addition to their antihistaminic properties. Therefore, a single-blind three-way crossover study was designed to assess the influence of single-dose dimethindene maleate (new ""once a day formulation"") on vigilance and performance vs. loratadine as reference and vs. placebo. Drug effects on performance were tested in 18 healthy volunteers by the oculodynamic test [ODT, i.e. choice reaction task (CRT), combined with recording of electrooculography (EOG) and cardiovascular parameters] and effects on subjective well-being by visual analogue scales (VAS). Main target parameters for evaluation of CNS-effects are latency and subjective perception of sedation (VAS). Neither statistically significant nor clinically relevant differences in all objective and subjective target variables (ODT and VAS) between active drugs and placebo, after single-dose administration were found. The same holds for accessory EOG, CRT and vital parameters under workload. "
"Abstract: The aim of the study was to develop a laboratory system to challenge mite allergic patients with physiological concentrations of Der p I in order to evaluate the efficacy of antiallergic drugs in mite allergic patients. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was designed with three consecutive sessions. Twelve patients with proven sensitivity to dust mite were treated with a single dose of dimethindene maleate in a FOAD formulation (4 and 8 mg vs. placebo) 12 h before a long-term challenge with mite allergen Der p I in the Vienna challenge chamber. Challenge was performed with a constant concentration of 40 ng Der p I per cubic meter of air for 4 h. Nasal parameters were recorded at 15 min intervals during long-term challenge. In comparison to placebo, dimethindene leads to a statistically significant reduction (p < 0.05) of the nasal response at both concentrations tested. The house-dust mite model in the Vienna challenge chamber thus proved to be a useful tool for drug investigations in mite allergies. "
"BACKGROUND: Treatment of the pain of acute herpes zoster by local anesthetic injections has drawbacks. Topical percutaneous local anesthesia (TPLA) may offer another strategy of providing regional analgesia in affected patients. OBJECTIVE: We evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of 9% (wt/vol) lidocaine (base) in petrolatum/paraffin ointment in patients with acute herpes zoster. METHODS: Ointment was applied to the affected skin of 22 patients. Pain, tenderness, sensitivity to pinprick and cold, and blood lidocaine concentration were measured repeatedly during a 20-hour interval and intermittently thereafter. RESULTS: Mean pain, tenderness, and cutaneous sensation scores were reduced at measurements taken from 4 to 20 hours after ointment application (p < 0.05), but not every patient obtained relief. No patient had local skin irritation or systemic toxic effects related to the local anesthetic. CONCLUSIONS: TPLA is a promising therapy for control of cutaneous pain of acute herpes zoster. Controlled studies should be performed to prove efficacy, determine optimal TPLA formulation, and define dosage limits. "
"Abstract: The systemic availability of a solid dispersion (coevaporate) of clofazimine (CLF) in poly(vinyl methyl ether maleic anhydride) copolymer (PVM/MA) was tested in the pig. Single 100 mg oral doses of the coevaporate and the commercial product, Lamprene (Ciba-Geigy) were administered on separate occasions (separated by a two-week washout period) to four pigs (two males, two females) in a random cross-over study. Multiple plasma samples, obtained from an indwelling jugular-vein cannula, following drug administration, were analysed by an HPLC method for CLF. Pharmacokinetic analyses of the plasma CLF concentration-time data were performed. A paired t-test indicated significant differences (p < 0.05) between the coevaporate and Lamprene in the Cpmax, tmax, and AUC. The calculated relative systemic bioavailability (Frel) of CLF from the coevaporate, relative to that from Lamprene, was three. It is concluded that formulation of CLF, as a solid dispersion, may provide enhanced aqueous dissolution and systemic absorption and may also provide high therapeutic blood levels. These could lead to reduction in the current therapeutic doses and, consequently, minimization of drug-related side effects. "
"Abstract: The inter- and intraindividual variability of cyclosporine pharmacokinetics from a microemulsion formulation were compared with the currently marketed formulation in a sequential bioreplication study. Twenty-four healthy male volunteers were randomized to receive each formulation on two separate occasions; the reference treatment was a single oral dose of 300 mg of Sandimmune and the test treatment was a single oral dose of 180 mg of Sandimmune Neoral, both given as soft gelatin capsules. Serial venous blood samples were obtained over a period of 48 h after each administration, and cyclosporine concentrations were measured in whole blood by a specific monoclonal RIA method. Between- and within-subject variabilities were quantified from the appropriate sums of squares from analysis of variance and statistically compared between formulations. Both inter- and intraindividual variation for the peak concentration, time to reach the peak, area under the curve, and terminal half-life of the test formulation were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) with two exceptions. For area under the curve between subjects (p < 0.2) and peak concentration within subjects (p < 0.1), trends toward reduced variability for the test formulation were evident. These results were further reflected in the inter- and intraindividual coefficients of variation of the pharmacokinetic parameters that ranged from 3 to 22% for the test formulation compared with 19 to 41% for the reference formulation. In comparison with the currently marketed formulation, reduced variability in the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine following oral administration of Sandimmune Neoral provides a more predictable and consistent concentration-time profile. "
"Abstract: In the past 4 years, a high incidence (118/362) of positive patch test reactions to E45 cream were noted in 2 patch testing clinics. 18/54 of those patch tested to all the ingredients demonstrated allergies to ingredients. The most frequent was triethanolamine; lanolin allergy occurring in only 1 patient. The remaining reactions may be explained as irritant reactions resulting from triethanolamine stearate (TES) formation within the cream. The irritancy of triethanolamine stearate was demonstrated in patients and controls. Conductivity studies showed that TES arises from the combination of the ingredients triethanolamine and stearic acid. The formulation of E45 cream was being changed at the time of writing, with the removal of triethanolamine from the product. "
"Abstract: Chemotherapy using cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, cytarabine, bleomycin, vincristine, methotrexate with leucovorin, and prednisone (ProMACE-CytaBOM) for patients with intermediate or high grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas (G, H and K according to the Working Formulation), was tested by the Gruppo Cooperativo Lombardo to confirm the activity of the regimen and to test the feasibility and safety of administering third-generation drug regimen in a cooperative group setting. Among 64 previously untreated patients, aged between 20 and 71 years, 7 had stage IB-IIB, 12 had stage IIIA-B, 45 (67%) had stage IVA-B. There were 44 complete remissions (CRs) (69%) and 14 partial remissions (22%); the difference between patients in stage I-II-III (84% complete remissions) and those in stage IV (62% complete remissions) was statistically significant. The median length of follow up was 20 months (range 1-60 months), with 56% of patients alive at 60 months and 53% of CRs patients free of disease at 60 months. Patients in stage I-II-III have the best survival and disease free survival compared to stage IV, 87% versus 42% and 72% versus 32% respectively (both with high statistical significance). Grade 3-4 (WHO) haematological toxicity was observed in 39% of patients, with 3 septic deaths. Two more patients died with chemotherapy related toxicity (1 stroke and 1 acute renal insufficiency). Administration of ProMACE-CytaBOM is a feasible and safe regimen although it presents moderate toxicity. ProMACE-CytaBOM may represent improved treatment for aggressive lymphomas, in terms of duration of response and survival, but a longer follow up is needed. "
"Abstract: Nervous system complications resulting from i.v. administration of cyclosporine (CS) are especially frequent in liver transplant recipients. Because CS is insoluble in water, the i.v. preparation is formulated in a polyoxyethylated castor oil and ethyl alcohol. Rat dorsal root ganglion neurons exposed in vitro to the i.v. preparation exhibited axonal swelling and degeneration. No effect of CS (dissolved directly in serum) was seen on testing individual components of the i.v. solution. However, 0.1% polyoxyethylated castor oil (volume of solute/volume of solvent) produced axonal swelling and degeneration and 0.001% polyoxyethylated castor oil produced demyelination in vitro. Polyoxyethylated castor oil is manufactured by reacting castor oil with ethylene oxide, and we speculate that residual ethylene oxide or a polymerization product may be responsible for the in vitro neurotoxicity. Although little is known about the pharmacokinetics of polyoxyethylated castor oil, plasma levels of 0.001 to 0.01% polyoxyethylated castor oil (volume of solute/volume of solvent) are probably achieved with therapeutic doses of the i.v. CS preparation. "
"Abstract: The steady-state pharmacokinetics of a new oral formulation of cyclosporin A (Sandimmun Neoral, NOF, a microemulsion) was compared with those of the market formulation (Sandimmun, SIM) in stable renal transplant patients. Both formulations were administered as soft gelatin capsules every 12 h with doses adjusted to provide comparable trough concentrations (CminSS). Whole blood samples were obtained over a steady-state dosing interval (tau), and the cyclosporin A level was determined by a specific monoclonal RIA. Both formulations were well tolerated. The mean doses were 139 +/- 27 mg (SIM) vs. 120 +/- 19 mg (NOF), indicating a milligram dose-conversion factor of approximately 1:1 to yield comparable troughs. NOF exhibited a stronger correlation between AUCtauSS and CminSS (r2 = 0.821) compared with SIM (r2 = 0.288), due in part to less variability in the NOF profiles. Average increases of 39% in CmaxSS and 15% in AUCtauSS during treatment with NOF were not associated with any safety concerns over the 4-week exposure to Sandimmun Neoral, as evidenced by the absence of changes in blood pressure, hematologic and biochemical parameters (including serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, BUN) and ultrasound of the transplanted kidney. "
"Abstract: The current therapy with Sandimmun has been improved by the development of a new oral formulation of its active ingredient, Cyclosporine A and which is called Sandimmun Neoral. This new galenical formulation is based on the microemulsion technology and offers consistent oral absorption and pharmacokinetic predictability. In two studies of a 12 weeks duration each and including 466 stable renal transplant patients and 86 new renal transplant patients it was shown that Sandimmun Neoral is as well tolerated and as safe as Sandimmun. Stable renal transplant patients currently receiving Sandimmun can safely be switched to Sandimmun Neoral on a 1:1 dose level basis. However, as a result of the more consistent absorption of Sandimmun Neoral, poor absorbers with Sandimmun will become normal absorbers and than will need a considerable dose reduction to reach the same Cyclosporine A exposure. In new renal transplant patients kidney function seems to improve better and faster when Sandimmun Neoral is given as shown by creatinine and creatinine clearance values. In the Sandimmun Neoral group less patients experienced a rejection episode and time free of rejection was longer, this may reflect a better maintenance of immunosuppression. In addition, considerably lower doses (16% on average) are required for Sandimmun Neoral to achieve comparable cyclosporine A blood trough levels and these patients are also sooner stabilized in terms of Cyclosporine a therapy.

"OBJECTIVE: To identify prescribing patterns of ondansetron, to provide a general overview of the therapeutic responses and possible adverse effects to ondansetron in selected children's hospitals, and to evaluate this methodology of surveillance and assess its effectiveness as a means to collect postmarketing experience with a drug in pediatric patients. DESIGN: This survey examined the use of ondansetron in 210 children. Complete drug and medical histories, indications, doses, possible ondansetron-associated adverse reactions, and daily responses to ondansetron therapy were recorded by a study pharmacist for each patient. Patients were followed until discharged from the clinic or hospital and/or until ondansetron therapy was discontinued. SETTING: The survey was conducted in seven free-standing children's hospitals across the US. Hospitals ranged in size from 100 to 331 beds (average 234). One hospital was located on the West coast, one on the East coast, one in the Rocky Mountain region, one in the Southwest region, and three in the Midwest. PARTICIPANTS: The selection of study participants was limited to member free-standing children's hospitals of the Pediatric Pharmacy Administrative Group. Selection was based on geographic location and availability of a pharmacist to coordinate the study. One pharmacist at each study site served as surveillance coordinator. Each pharmacist monitored without intervention the use of ondansetron in 30 children. Patients were enrolled consecutively from physicians' orders for ondansetron. Enrollment was open to clinic and hospital patients. Patients were excluded if more than 48 hours of retrospective review was required. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The survey queried patient demographics, type of antineoplastic therapy administered, indications and dosing regimen(s) for ondansetron, additional antiemetic agents administered, and clinical response. Adverse drug reactions and prescriptions for ondansetron on discharge were recorded. An evaluation of response rates in hospital patients based on exposure to antineoplastic regimens causing acute (within 24 h) or delayed emesis (after 24 h) was formulated after data collection. Off-label use was summarized. RESULTS: Surveys from 197 of the 210 patients enrolled were complete for evaluation. Ondansetron was used to treat chemotherapy-induced emesis in 88 percent of the patients and 12 percent received it for various other indications. Ondansetron dosing was off-label in 15 percent and 73 percent prior to and after an emetogenic exposure, respectively. Twenty-six percent of the patients were younger than four years. Dosages ranged from 0.15 to 0.45 mg/kg, given in various schedules. The injectable form was given both intravenously and orally. There was a significant difference in the mean number of doses in hospital (9 +/- 7.3) versus clinic (2 +/- 1.5) patients (p < 0.0001). Eighty-seven percent of all patients had a complete or major overall response. Possible ondansetron-associated adverse reactions were similar to those of previous reports for all patients, although some recorded reactions are not currently included in package labeling. CONCLUSIONS: This study documents off-label use of ondansetron in children. Further study of ondansetron use in children less than four years of age, and for indications other than chemotherapy-induced emesis, is needed. Additional evaluation into the most cost-effective dosing of ondansetron would also be valuable. "
"Abstract: The exposure of 11 pharmaceutical plant workers to methotrexate (MTX) was studied. Personal air samples were taken during the different manufacturing processes: drug compounding, vial filling, and tablet preparation. The uptake of MTX was established by the determination of MTX in urine. MTX was analyzed using the fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA), a method that is frequently used for monitoring serum levels in patients treated with MTX. The FPIA method was modified in such a way that MTX could be measured quickly and efficiently in air and urine samples. MTX was detected in air samples of all workers except for those involved in the vial filling process (range: 0.8-182 micrograms/m3; median: 10 micrograms/m3). The highest concentrations were observed for workers weighing MTX (118 and 182 micrograms/m3). MTX was detected in urine samples of all workers. The mean cumulative MTX excretion over 72-96 h was 13.4 micrograms MTX-equivalents (range: 6.1-24 micrograms MTX-equivalents). A significantly lower background level of 10.2 micrograms MTX-equivalents was measured in urine of 30 control persons (range: 4.9-21 micrograms MTX-equivalents). "
"Abstract: Cyclosporin A (CyA) is an extremely lipophilic drug that needs a solubilizing agent to become soluble in water. In the commercially available intravenous formulation--Sandimmun--Cremophor EL is used for this purpose. It is likely that Cremophor EL contributes to some of the side effects produced by i.v. Sandimmun. We have recently shown that if Cremophor EL is replaced by a soybean oil (SBO)-based fat emulsion carrier, the acute renal side effects following i.v. administration of CyA are avoided in a rat model. It is then important to ascertain whether the use of a fat emulsion carrier alters the immunosuppressive effect of CyA. Moreover, fatty acids can themselves influence the immune system, and both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids have been reported to possess immunosuppressive properties. In the present study, the effect on graft survival of i.v. CyA administered in five different formulations, using fat emulsions or liposomes as carriers, was compared to that of conventional Sandimmun infusion substance in the heterotopic heart transplant model in rats. The new formulations tested did not reduce the immunosuppressive effect of CyA. On the contrary, a small but significant increase in graft survival was noted in the groups given CyA in the SBO-based fat emulsion carrier (17.0 +/- 0.82 days) and CyA in liposomes (16.0 +/- 0.63 days) as compared to the results in the Sandimmun-treated group (15.0 +/- 0.58 days: P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively).

"Abstract: An outline of the pharmacology of important components of extemporaneous prescriptions will be undertaken over four issues of the journal. Substances such as dithranol, salicylic acid and coal tar will be examined in some depth with regard to their mode of action, uses and side effects. In addition, examples of extemporaneous formulations containing these substances will be provided along with advice regarding their use. Substances such as sulphur, calamine, podophyllin and menthol will also be reviewed using the same format but in less detail. The articles are designed to provide practical knowledge in the area of extemporaneous prescribing. Complicated areas of pharmaceutical chemistry, unless relevant to the clinical setting, will not be discussed. "
"Abstract: In order to improve the therapeutic index of adapalene, a new drug under development for the treatment of acne, site-specific delivery to the hair follicles using 50:50 poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres as particulate carriers was investigated in vitro and in vivo. The percutaneous penetration pathway of the microspheres was shown to be dependent on their mean diameter. Thus, after topical application onto hairless rat or human skin, adapalene-loaded microspheres (5-microns diameter) were specifically targeted to the follicular ducts and did not penetrate via the stratum corneum. The in vitro release of adapalene from the microspheres into artificial sebum at 37 degrees C was controlled and faster than the in vivo sebum excretion in humans. Aiming to reduce either the applied dose of drug or the frequency of administration, different formulations of adapalene-loaded microspheres were evaluated in vivo in the rhino mouse model. A dose-related comedolytic activity of topical formulations of adapalene-loaded microspheres was observed in this model. Furthermore, by applying a site-specific drug delivery system (0.1% adapalene) every other day or by administering a 10-fold less concentrated targeted formulation (0.01%) every day, a pharmacological activity equivalent to a daily application of an aqueous gel containing drug crystals (0.1% adapalene) was observed. Since an aqueous gel containing 10% adapalene-loaded microspheres was not irritating in a rabbit skin irritancy test, this formulation was applied onto forearms of human volunteers. Site-specific drug delivery was further evidenced by follicular biopsy. Since an aqueous gel containing 10% adapalene-loaded microspheres was not irritating in a rabbit skin irritancy test, this formulation was applied onto forearms of human volunteers. Site-specific drug delivery was further evidenced by follicular biopsy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) "
"Abstract: Five hundred and eighty-five patients with moderate asthma, currently receiving 400-1000 micrograms day-1 of an inhaled corticosteroid, were treated for 6 weeks in a double-blind, randomized, parallel group study with either 500 micrograms day-1 fluticasone propionate as a dry powder via a Diskhaler inhaler, 500 micrograms day-1 fluticasone propionate via a pressurized inhaler or 1000 micrograms day-1 beclomethasone dipropionate via a pressurized inhaler. For all three treatment groups, mean morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates (PEFRs) increased within 1 week of the start of treatment. There were also improvements in clinic lung function, daytime and night-time asthma symptoms and a reduction in daytime and night-time rescue bronchodilator medication in all three groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the two formulations of fluticasone propionate in any of the efficacy parameters. Fluticasone propionate via the Diskhaler was significantly more effective than beclomethasone dipropionate over the 6 week study period in reducing diurnal variation (mean difference--4 l min-1, 95% CI--8 to 0 l min-1: P = 0.03). Fluticasone propionate via the Diskhaler produced a statistically significant improvement in night-time symptoms when compared to beclomethasone dipropionate whereas, beclomethasone dipropionate 1000 micrograms day-1 was statistically significantly more effective than both formulations of fluticasone propionate in improving daytime symptoms (P < 0.05). However, these statistical differences must be viewed together with the fact that very few patients recorded a score of 2 or more for both daytime or night-time symptoms. There was a similarly low incidence of adverse events with all three treatments with no evidence of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA)-axis suppression. The results of the 6-week comparative study showed that 500 micrograms day-1 fluticasone propionate whether administered via pressurized inhaler or Diskhaler is as effective and as safe as 1000 micrograms day-1 beclomethasone dipropionate administered via a pressurized inhaler in the treatment of moderate asthma. Over 12 months fluticasone propionate 500 micrograms day-1 via a pressurized inhaler was at least as effective and as well tolerated as beclomethasone dipropionate 1000 micrograms day-1. "
"BACKGROUND: Many of the diverse group of pharmacologic agents available for the treatment of rheumatic diseases have the potential to cause serious hepatotoxicity. OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with drug-induced hepatotoxicity in rheumatic disease. SUMMARY: While mild elevations in plasma transaminase concentrations are associated with almost all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), clinically significant hepatic toxicity is very rare. NSAID-induced liver injury probably has an immunologic basis, but neither a detailed mechanism nor precise incidence rates are known. Methotrexate can cause hepatic fibrosis during chronic use, but the liver injury is poorly reflected by plasma transaminase concentrations; it is difficult to formulate monitoring recommendations when this agent is used in rheumatic disease. Gold and penicillamine have been associated with rare cases of hepatic toxicity as well. CONCLUSIONS: Drug treatment of rheumatic diseases is associated with a small but well-documented risk of hepatotoxicity. Recognizing the clinical syndromes associated with liver injury by these agents facilitates the minimization of morbidity from this complication. "
"BACKGROUND: The therapy for skin diseases with topical glucocorticoids is limited by their local and systemic side effects. A glucocorticoid with an improved benefit-to-risk ratio is desirable. OBJECTIVE: A new topical corticoid, methylprednisolone aceponate (MPA) 0.1% ointment, was compared with the same formulation of mometasone furoate. METHODS: The two ointments were compared with respect to suppression of UVB light-induced erythema (n = 20) and with respect to atrophogenicity and appearance of telangiectasia (n = 20) in two double-blind trials with intraindividual comparisons in healthy volunteers. In a third trial, serum cortisol levels were measured in volunteers receiving extensive (60% of body surface) cutaneous application of MPA (n = 10) or mometasone furoate (n = 11). RESULTS: MPA and mometasone furoate were equally effective in suppressing UVB light-induced erythema. Atrophogenicity, as well as the incidence and severity of telangiectasia, were significantly more pronounced with mometasone furoate than with MPA. Both ointments decreased serum cortisol levels and did not differ significantly in this respect. However, the incidence of serum cortisol level suppression was higher in the mometasone furoate group than in the MPA group. CONCLUSION: MPA ointment has equal antiinflammatory activity and similar cortisol suppression but significantly fewer local side effects than mometasone furoate. "
"Abstract: Studies in which high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) is used for the treatment of osteosarcoma have utilized commercial formulations of d,l-leucovorin (leucovorin calcium) for rescue from potential methotrexate (MTX) toxicity. These formulations are racemic mixtures containing equal amounts of d and l isomers of leucovorin. All of the available data indicate that the l isomer is the pharmacologically active diastereomer. A clinical study was conducted to determine if l-leucovorin was as safe and efficacious as d,l-leucovorin in the rescue of patients with osteosarcoma who were treated with HDMTX (12.5 g/m2 over 6 h). Because d,l-leucovorin consists of equal proportions of d and l isomers, l-leucovorin was administered at half the usual dose of d,l-leucovorin. In patients with delayed methotrexate excretion, l-leucovorin doses were escalated from 7.5 to 50 mg every 3 h until the MTX level was 0.3 mumol/l or less. Due to the low incidence of osteosarcoma, a control group of patients previously treated with d,l-leucovorin was utilized for comparison. Efficacy of l-leucovorin was determined by its ability to prevent HDMTX-associated toxicity. Demographic and clinical toxicity data from three patients who received 22 courses of MTX rescued with l-leucovorin were compared with data from six patients who had received 42 MTX courses rescued with d,l-leucovorin. Some liver function abnormalities and leukocyte elevations were found in both groups and were attributed to MTX administration. No clinical toxicity attributable to l-leucovorin was observed. l-Leucovorin in half the d,l-leucovorin dose was (equally) effective as a rescue treatment. "
"Abstract: Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic steroid for use by the inhaled route. It's high topical potency and low systemic bioavailability make it suitable for use in asthmatic children. A total of 258 children were randomised in a double-blind study to receive fluticasone propionate (50 micrograms bd) as the dry powder formulation inhaled via a Diskhaler inhaler, or matched placebo (with current therapy) for 4 weeks throughout which time diary cards were completed. During clinic visits lung function and adrenal function were measured. Fluticasone propionate produced a significantly greater increase in morning peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) (adjusted mean difference over days 1-28, 17 l/min (95% CI; 10, 24); P < 0.001) and evening PEFR (adjusted mean difference over days 1-28, 16 l/min (95% CI; 9, 23); P < 0.001). In addition, diary card symptom scores, beta 2-agonist rescue and clinic lung function improved significantly on fluticasone propionate. There were few adverse events and basal plasma cortisol remained within the normal range. In conclusion fluticasone propionate at 50 micrograms bd is superior to placebo (current therapy) in the treatment of childhood asthma with no evidence of adverse effects. "
"Abstract: The oral administration of retinoids such as etretinate and acitretin (Ro 10-1670, CAS 55079-83-9), provides a successful therapeutic approach in various cutaneous diseases characterized by disturbed keratinization, e.g. psoriasis. Nevertheless oral therapy is often associated with systemic adverse effects. This makes a topical form with no or reduced systemic side effects desirable. Direct application of a topical acitretin formulation to the skin might result in therapeutic skin concentrations while minimizing systemic exposure. In the hairless guinea pig and in the rhesus monkey the percutaneous absorption of [14C]acitretin from an isopropylmyristate formulation (160 micrograms acitretin/2.5 cm2/animal) were investigated in vivo. After a 24 h exposure drug concentration in the skin was higher in the hairless guinea pig (620 ng-eq/g wet tissue) than in the rhesus monkey (380 ng-eq/g wet tissue). A similar observation was made comparing the 24 h absorption data determined as amount of drug excreted. The results are compared with in vitro absorption data using skin from the same species. "
"Abstract: A popular ""skin protector"" consisting of an emulsion-like foam of lipophilic and hydrophilic substances (Marly skin) was evaluated in a previously described repetitive irritation guinea pig model. The product failed to inhibit the irritation due to sodium lauryl sulphate and toluene. In striking contrast to the recommended use, the irritant response of sodium hydroxide was aggravated, as demonstrated by significant differences for all test parameters (clinical score for erythema and scaling, transepidermal water loss, blood flow volume). The results show that protection against chemical irritants may be quite specific and that some formulations may actually be harmful. "
"Abstract: The experimental gingivitis model has long been used to evaluate chemotherapeutic agents in mouthrinses. Only recently however has the model been modified to test undiluted dentifrices by using a toothshield both to apply dentifrice and to protect selected teeth from toothbrushing. This also enables participants to brush the rest of the mouth and avoid the unpleasantness of 3 weeks without oral hygiene. Because of its well-documented efficacy, chlorhexidine was used in a toothpaste formulation to investigate the validity of the partial-mouth, experimental gingivitis model for evaluating therapeutic dentifrices. Optimal gingival health was established in 88 adults, who then were randomly assigned to two equal groups. A toothshield was constructed for each subject to fit the teeth of one mandibular quadrant. During the trial chlorhexidine or placebo dentifrice was applied undiluted to the test teeth via the toothshield, which also prevented plaque removal during brushing of the remaining dentition. After 21 days, plaque and gingivitis had developed in both groups. However, the chlorhexidine group had significantly less plaque and gingivitis than the placebo group. No adverse soft tissue effects were observed. This study demonstrated that the partial-mouth, experimental gingivitis model allowed unhindered development of plaque and gingivitis that was comparable to whole-mouth studies in which oral hygiene was suspended for 3 weeks. By corroborating with chlorhexidine, it is concluded that this short-term clinical model is valid for evaluating the chemotherapeutic effects of dentifrices. "
"Abstract: Six-hundred-and-three people aged 40 or more years, from Maryborough in central Victoria, were enrolled in a randomized longitudinal study, which required daily application of either a SPF 15+, broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen cream or the cream base without the active ingredients. The study duration was 7 months, from September 1991 until April 1992. One-hundred-and-fourteen (18.9%) of these subjects developed an adverse reaction to the cream they were applying. Patch testing, photopatch testing and scratch testing with the ingredients of the creams revealed that only a small proportion (< 10%) of the inflammatory eruptions were allergic in nature. None of the people tested was allergic to the sunscreen active ingredients. History and examination findings, where available, suggested that the majority of adverse responses were consistent with an irritant reaction, both to the sunscreen preparation and the base cream control. A higher than expected proportion of the people who developed an adverse reaction had a personal history consistent with atopy. Other reactions included acneiform eruptions and contact urticaria. A frequency of reactions to sunscreen preparations of over 15% means that further work is necessary to improve both the formulation of such products, and the manner and conditions under which they are used, to ensure satisfactory compliance.

"Abstract: Acceptable oil-emulsion vaccines were sought to replace mineral oil-emulsion vaccines that, by regulations, require a 42-day minimum holding period for poultry between injection and slaughter for consumption. Water-in-oil emulsions were prepared using animal or vegetable oils in a ratio of 4 parts oil to 1 part Newcastle disease or avian influenza aqueous antigen. Beeswax particles suspended in the oil at the 5% or 10% level (wt:vol) served as the oil-phase surfactant. Hemagglutination-inhibition titers induced by mineral-oil vaccines were not significantly different from those induced by the most efficacious formulations prepared from animal and vegetable oils. Tissue reaction from injection of animal- and vegetable-oil vaccines was less than that induced by mineral-oil vaccines. An inactivated avian influenza vaccine formulated from peanut oil induced protection against morbidity and death when vaccinated chickens were challenged with a virulent isolate of avian influenza virus.

"Abstract: Psoralen photochemotherapy with UVA (PUVA) has been reported to be successfully substitutional for, or an adjunct to, conventional treatments in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). Against the considerable advantages of utilizing PUVA for AD patients, however, it must also be balanced against the possible hazards for individual patients. We attempted herein to formulate a guideline for the selection of AD patients assigned to PUVA. According to this guideline, 114 patients were selected for PUVA treatment. Forty-five percent of the patients did not respond adequately to other conventional forms of treatment. Side effects from former treatments, particularly steroids, appeared in 39% of the patients. Subsequent to the treatments, the skin lesions significantly decreased in 81% of the inpatients and 67% of the outpatients, while some patient's lesions disappeared, despite that other forms of treatment had been unsuccessful in many cases.

"Abstract: Different phospholipids and methods of preparation were used to produce cyclosporin encapsulated in liposomes. The optimal formulation of cyclosporin-liposome was compared to the oily cyclosporin after intraperitoneal administration of 25 mg kg-1 body weight to rats. Urinary kallikrein excretion was significantly reduced with the liposomal form. The abrupt increase of kallikrein excretion after the tenth day with the control oil preparation suggests that cyclosporin toxicity could be present at the tubular level, and the encapsulation of cyclosporin in liposomes reduces tubular damage. "
"Abstract: Chlorhexidine and fluoride have valuable preventive roles in dental and oral diseases. There is also evidence that in caries prevention, together, they provide additive benefits. However, combined chlorhexidine/fluoride formulations have rarely been evaluated. The aim of this study was to determine whether a 0.12% chlorhexidine, 100 ppm F- mouthrinse provided adjunctive oral hygiene benefits compared to a minus active control rinse. The study was a randomised double-blind parallel design involving 102 subjects of whom 99 completed the 6 week experimental period. Subjects rinsed 2x per day for 1 min with 15 ml of the allocated rinse. Normal toothbrushing procedures were maintained throughout the study. At 6 weeks, plaque and gingivitis scores were significantly lower and the incremental reduction significantly larger in the active rinse group. However, as expected, toothstaining was significantly increased with the active rinse. It is apparent that this chlorhexidine/fluoride rinse could be used in those regimens recommended for other chlorhexidine formulations. The value of the formulation in caries prevention would seem worthy of further investigation. "
"Abstract: The mechanism of the transient encephalopathy induced by high dose systemic administration of methotrexate (HDMTX) is unknown. Metabolic and vascular hypothesis have been formulated but convincing evidence is lacking. We report the first case of vascular disturbances (thinness of cortical arteries on angiography, reversible fall down of cerebral flow and increase of carotid resistance) in a young Algerian patient treated for an osteogenic osteosarcoma. This observation might lead to the exploration by non invasive and easily repeatable techniques of the cerebral vascular dynamic in patients submitted to HDMTX and thus contributed to the elucidation of the mechanism and to the prevention of these neurological side effect. "
"Abstract: The safety of intravenous (IV) and oral ondansetron has been evaluated in over 7,000 cancer patients in world-wide clinical trials. In adult patients receiving single-day chemotherapy, the incidence of adverse events was 45% with IV ondansetron (n = 317) and 59% with metoclopramide (n = 279). Headache occurred in 17% of ondansetron patients and 10% of metoclopramide patients, whereas diarrhea symptoms were reported in 15% of the former and 29% of the latter. The incidence and types of adverse events were similar following three 0.15 mg/kg IV ondansetron doses and 8- or 32-mg single IV doses. There was a slight increase in the incidence of headache following a single 32-mg dose (25%) compared with a single 8-mg dose (18%) or three 0.15 mg/kg doses (18%). The safety profile of oral ondansetron was similar to that of the IV formulation. Following an 8-mg oral dose administered three times a day for 3 days, the most frequently reported adverse events were headache (21%), constipation (7%), and abdominal pain (5%). In a group of 209 pediatric patients receiving chemotherapy, the incidence of adverse events following IV and oral ondansetron was 19%. The most commonly reported adverse event was headache (4%). In comparative clinical trials, extrapyramidal symptoms were reported in 5% of the metoclopramide patients but none of the ondansetron patients. In open-label trials, two patients who received ondansetron reported symptoms consistent with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal reactions. The incidence of vascular occlusive events and seizure disorders was identical for ondansetron and comparative agents. Serum transaminase values increased significantly in 6% to 8% of ondansetron patients and 2% of metoclopramide patients who received cisplatin. There was no apparent relationship between the dose of ondansetron administered and the incidence of increased transaminase abnormalities. However, there was an apparent relationship between the dose of cisplatin administered and the incidence of transaminase abnormalities. In patients who received non-cisplatin chemotherapy, there was no difference in serum transaminase values between oral ondansetron and placebo. These data demonstrate that ondansetron is better tolerated than metoclopramide and is safe for IV and oral administration to patients receiving chemotherapy. In addition, ondansetron is well tolerated when administered as a single 32-mg infusion over 15 minutes. "
"Abstract: The vesicant agents of the unitary chemical munitions stockpile include various formulations of sulfur mustard [bis-(2-chloroethyl) sulfide; agents H, HD, and HT] and small quantities of the organic arsenical Lewisite [dichloro(2-chlorovinyl) arsine; agent L]. These agents can be dispersed in liquid, aerosol, or vapor form and are capable of producing severe chemical burns upon direct contact with tissue. Moist tissues such as the eyes, respiratory tract, and axillary areas are particularly affected. Available data summarizing acute dose response in humans and laboratory animals are summarized. Vesicant agents are also capable of generating delayed effects such as chronic bronchitis, carcinogenesis, or keratitis/keratopathy of the eye under appropriate conditions of exposure and dose. These effects may not become manifest until years following exposure. Risk analysis derived from carcinogenesis data indicates that sulfur mustard possesses a carcinogenic potency similar to that of benzo[a]pyrene. Because mustard agents are alkylating compounds, they destroy individual cells by reaction with cellular proteins, enzymes, RNA, and DNA. Once begun, tissue reaction is irreversible. Mustard agents are mutagenic; data for cellular and laboratory animal assays are presented. Reproductive effects have not been demonstrated in the offspring of laboratory rats. Acute Lewisite exposure has been implicated in cases of Bowen's disease, an intraepidermal squamous cell carcinoma. Lewisite is not known to generate reproductive or teratogenic effects. "
"Abstract: A purified preparation of the nontoxic antimicrobial peptide, nisin (AMBICIN N), was used in the formulation of a germicidal sanitizer suitable for use on cow teats. The germicidal activity of the formulation against mastitis pathogens was measured on teat skin of live cows. The nisin-based formulation gave a mean log reduction of 3.90 against Staphylococcus aureus and 4.22 log reduction against Escherichia coli after exposure for 1 min to the germicide. This activity was comparable with that exhibited by a 1% iodophor teat dip but was significantly greater than that exhibited by the .1 and .5% iodophors and by the .5% chlorhexidine digluconate teat dips. The nisin-based formulation showed little or no potential for skin irritation after multiple application to skin, but iodophor and chlorhexidine digluconate teat dips showed significant potential for skin irritation in comparable studies.

"Abstract: Eighty-three previously untreated patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were treated with either MACOP-B (23 patients) or VACOP-B (60 patients) as originally described by Klimo and Conners [1, 2]. Their median age was 46 years. Thirty-seven patients had stage I or II and 46 stage III or IV disease. The tumor histopathology was reviewed in all cases. Sixty-five patients had intermediate grade and 18 high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas according to the International Working Formulation. The rate of complete response was 74% for MACOP-B and 76% for VACOP-B. At the time of analysis the duration of follow-up was 50 months for the MACOP-B and 22 months for the VACOP-B group. The actuarial three-year progression-free survival was 35 +/- 10% for the MACOP-B group, 48 +/- 11% for the VACOP-B group, and 46 +/- 7% for all patients. Treatment mortality was 6%. A univariate and a multivariate analysis of selected pretreatment parameters and of regimen demonstrated that stage III or IV, high-grade lymphoma, and elevated serum LDH, but not the type of regimen, are significantly associated with poor progression-free survival in our patient population. "
"Abstract: The emulsifier for cyclosporin in clinical i.v. formulations, Cremophor EL, has recently come into question as a possible source of neurotoxic side effects in immunosuppressant therapy. To address this issue we tested Cremophor EL and cyclosporin on an in vitro neuronal model, the differentiating N1E.115 neuroblastoma cell. In terms of effects on elaboration of neurites by these cells, Cremophor accounted for nearly all the neurotoxicity of clinically formulated cyclosporin. At a concentration of 0.005% (v/v), Cremophor EL halved the number of cells that extended neurites after 48 hr in serum-free medium. Average neurite length was also reduced substantially. Inhibition of neurite outgrowth first became apparent 24 hr after exposure to Cremophor EL. Neurites that did grow in the presence of Cremophor were disfigured by a series of regularly spaced, gross dilatations (beads) filled with large (0.2-0.5 microns) lipid vesicles. Abnormalities of rapid axonal transport were documented in the beaded neurites by means of video-enhanced contrast, differential interference-contrast microscopy. Velocity of retrograde transport remained normal, but the velocity of anterograde transport and the total bidirectional flux of organelles were both reduced. It seems likely that the inhibition of neurite outgrowth, the swellings of the neurites and the abnormalities of transport are interrelated phenomena. "
Abstract: Salicylates and steroids remain the mainstay of treatment for inflammatory bowel disease. New formulations which attempt to lower the rates of side effects are under evaluation. The value of azathioprine has been established in ulcerative colitis and cyclosporin has been shown to be of value. Dietary therapy in Crohn's disease has been the focus of a large amount of research and benefits have been demonstrated. New therapies including bioengineered drugs are anticipated. 
"Abstract: In the present double-blind investigation, the effects of a new formulation of natural cartilage polysaccharides on sundamaged skin were studied in women aged 40-60 years. A group of 15 women were treated orally with 500 mg/day active substance (Vivida) for 90 days and a second group of 15 women received 500 mg/day placebo for 90 days. Clinical examinations after 45 and 90 days' treatment showed significant improvements in skin condition in the actively treated group but not in the placebo group (P less than 0.001). In the Vivida-treated patients, the epidermal thickness increased after 90 days from 0.11 mm to 0.29 mm, dermal thickness from 0.74 mm to 1.39 mm, skin elasticity index from 44% to 73% and the erythemal index decreased from 0.301 to 0.205. No changes were observed in the placebo group and no adverse effects were reported by either treatment group. "
"BACKGROUND: Tretinoin administered topically in 0.1% concentration has been shown to improve the wrinkling and irregular pigmentation of photoaged skin. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of various concentrations of tretinoin in a new emollient cream base in the treatment of photoaged skin. METHODS: Three concentrations of tretinoin (0.05%, 0.01%, and 0.001%) in a new emollient cream formulation were compared with vehicle in a 24-week, double-blind, randomized, multicenter study of 296 subjects with photodamaged facial skin. RESULTS: Tretinoin emollient cream 0.05% gave a significantly better global response to therapy than vehicle (p less than 0.001), with 68% of subjects exhibiting improvement at the end of therapy, compared with 43% of subjects in the vehicle group. An excellent or good response was found in 26% of subjects treated with tretinoin emollient cream 0.05% versus 11% of vehicle-treated subjects. Fine wrinkling, mottled hyperpigmentation, and roughness were more improved in subjects who received tretinoin emollient cream 0.05% than in vehicle-treated subjects (p less than 0.05). No significant difference was found between vehicle and tretinoin emollient cream 0.01% or 0.001%. Histologic examination showed increases in epidermal and granular layer thickness, decreased melanin content and compaction of the stratum corneum after therapy with tretinoin emollient cream 0.05% or 0.01%. Mild to moderate skin reactions, such as erythema, peeling, and burning, were the most common side effects and, although most prevalent in the group using the 0.05% concentration, generally did not limit tretinoin use. CONCLUSION: Tretinoin emollient cream 0.05% appears to be safe and effective in the treatment of photodamaged skin. "
"Abstract: Thirty-nine patients with psoriasis undergoing PUVA participated in a prospective double-blind study of acute non-phototoxic adverse effects comparing the liquid formulations of 8-methoxypsoralen (0.6 mg/kg) and 5-methoxypsoralen (1.2 mg/kg). A much higher number of patients experienced nausea (8-MOP = 51.3%, 5-MOP = 7.7%) and pruritus (8-MOP = 71.8%, 5-MOP = 43.6%) than has been reported for crystalline tablets. No attempt was made to compare therapeutic efficacy between liquid and crystalline tablet formulations or between 8-MOP and 5-MOP, which both appeared to be effective. The high incidence of adverse effects suggests that current dosage recommendations be reviewed. "
"Abstract: The prevalent use of ""medical grade"" silicone oils, gels, and elastomers in medical practice has largely obscured the fact that other (illicit) materials also are still in use. Injection fluids used for tissue augmentations are sometimes composed of adulterated silicone oil formulations containing a variety of organic oils. The differential diagnosis between silicone mastitis and other organic oil mastitis in biopsy and mastectomy specimens cannot be resolved by oral history and histopathologic examination alone. In two of three specimens clinically and histopathologically diagnosed initially as silicone mastitis at the authors' institution, examination by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that the principal organic oils were mineral oil and soy or olive oil. Only one specimen of mastitis contained silicone oil. In view of the significant prognostic as well as medicolegal implications of the pathologic diagnosis, the generic term ""organic oil mastitis"" should be used in the absence of additional objective data. "
"Abstract: This study compares two treatment regimens, short- and long-contact dithranol in individually adjusted dosages, using a new formulation (Micanol) in the management of psoriasis. It was designed as a six week, randomized, open, parallel groups study. Twenty-two in-patients and 27 out-patients were included with either plaque type or small patch type of psoriasis. Patients in the short-contact group started using daily applications of 1% Micanol for an average of 13 minutes. The concentration and the application time were then gradually increased and after six weeks of treatment the corresponding averages were 2.5% and 185 minutes. Patients in the long-contact group started with daily applications of 0.1% Micanol for an average of eight hours. After six weeks the corresponding averages were 0.33% and 14 hours. The composite sign severity score (CSSS) was defined as the sum of scores for lesional erythema, desquamation and induration divided by three. The CSSS constituted the primary efficacy variable and was reduced by 73% after six weeks in the short-contact group and by 78% in the long-contact group. Side-effects were of low severity. There were no differences between neither treatment groups nor types of psoriasis apart from more staining of clothing in the short-contact group. This study suggests that Micanol is well suited for both short- and long-contact regimens in individually adjusted dosages and may be used for in- as well as out-patients. "
"Abstract: The objective of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy and acceptability of two dithranol creams (Micanol and Amitase) in patients with plaque type psoriasis treating themselves daily at home. Thirty-five patients started with Amitase (0.1%) and 37 with Micanol (0.1%) applied at night in this 6-week single-blind parallel groups comparison study. Patients who responded more slowly than a theoretically estimated ""standard"" rate of improvement had their concentration increased to 0.25% at the visit after 2 or 4 weeks. By the end of the study slightly more than half of the number of patients remained on 0.1%. There was no difference between the treatment groups. In comparison with the level at start the composite sign severity score for patients in the Amitase group was reduced by 24% after 1 week, 36% after 2 weeks, 49% after 4 weeks and 62% after 6 weeks. The reduction in the Micanol group was similar. Patients in the Micanol group showed after 1 week of treatment more irritative reactions than patients in the Amitase group. At all follow-up visits, staining of perilesional skin was more prevalent in the Micanol group. Staining of clothing was, however, far more prevalent and severe for patients given the Amitase cream. It may be concluded that Micanol is an important alternative for home treatment of psoriasis. "
"Abstract: Earlier studies have suggested that the rate of healing is somewhat slower for the new microencapsulated dithranol formulation, Micanol, than for petrolatum or paraffin based formulations. The less smeary Micanol formulation may need more vigorous application. A population of 29 patients with chronic, stable plaque-type psoriasis was divided into two groups, both receiving short contact treatment. One group received standard patient information while the other received information stressing the importance of being thorough when rubbing the dithranol cream into the lesions. Regarding composite sign severity score, there was a significant difference (about 50%) in favour of the extra information group after 6 weeks. This result suggests that thoroughness of application is an important factor for the rate of healing in short contact treatment of psoriasis with Micanol. "
"Abstract: The efficacy of home treatment of psoriasis with a new dithranol formulation, Micanol, was investigated in three studies. They were carried out according to a randomized, within-patient comparison design. In a 4-week pilot study Micanol was compared with placebo (10 patients) and in two 6-week studies Micanol was compared with dithranol 1% in petrolatum (33 patients) and with dithranol 1% in Amitase stick (16 patients). Micanol was found to be effective and well suited for treatment at home in all studies. The vehicle itself did not improve the psoriasis plaques. The rate of clinical improvement was faster for dithranol in petrolatum and Amitase stick than for Micanol. The prevalence and severity of erythema, burning and staining of skin and clothing were far less for Micanol. Approximately half the number of patients preferred dithranol in petrolatum or Amitase stick and the other half preferred Micanol. "
"Abstract: The clinical effect, side effects, cosmetic properties and the patients preference between Micanol and other dithranol formulations were investigated in three separate studies combining UV-B phototherapy and a short contact dithranol regimen. Good clinical results without difference between Micanol and other dithranol formulations were obtained. Side effects, cosmetic properties and preferences were mostly in favor of Micanol. Therefore, a high patient compliance can be obtained with the new dithranol formulation. "
"Abstract: A new tablet of micronized 5-methoxypsoralen (5-MOP) and a commonly used tablet in therapy (Psoraderm 5) were compared in 12 healthy subjects. Each subject ingested 1.2 mg/kg body weight of each formulation on different days. Bioavailability and phototoxicity of 5-MOP were compared. The results showed that serum and suction blister concentrations were significantly higher and occurred earlier after the oral intake of the micronized preparation. A series of graduated UVA doses were administered, one dose each time the concentration serum peaked, in order to determine the minimum phototoxic dose for each formulation. The micronized preparation induced greater photosensitivity than the unmicronized one. The micronized 5-MOP tablet may thus allow lower doses of UVA to achieve therapeutic results in photochemotherapy and a shortened waiting period following ingestion of drug. "
"Abstract: Using in vitro assays, this study was undertaken to determine whether the components of Lasso herbicide formulation had an effect on the human immune system. Mononuclear cells from human peripheral blood were exposed to analytical alachlor, alachlor conjugated to human serum albumin or Lasso formulation over a concentration range from .01 microM-1.0 microM. The effects of the test materials on the following immunological functions were determined: lymphocyte proliferation induced by mitogen or antigen; antibody synthesis of IgG and IgM isotypes in pokeweed stimulated mononuclear cell cultures; cytotoxic T cell proliferation; lysis of target cells by natural killer cells and lymphokine activated killer cells. The data demonstrated that the test compounds had no significant, dose related effect on the function of immunocompetent cells. Hence, the data suggest that the components of the Lasso formulation have no effect on the human immune system. "
"Abstract: The aromatic synthetic retinoid acid derivative, acitretin, is efficacious in several cutaneous diseases. Its toxicological profile makes a topical form with no or reduced systemic adverse effects desirable. Direct application of a topical acitretin formulation might result in therapeutic skin concentrations at the site of the disease while minimizing systemic exposure. The present studies define the percutaneous absorption characteristics of acitretin from an isopropylmyristate formulation. We investigated, in-vitro, (1) the role of receptor solution variations, (2) the role of skin modifications, (3) the influence of skin from three different species on the absorption of topically applied acitretin and (4) the drug distribution within the skin. Addition of solubilizers (Polyethylenglycol-20 and albumin) to the receptor solutions improved the flux of acitretin through monkey skin, whereas the acitretin concentration in the skin was not affected by the various receptor solutions used. Acitretin flux through tape-stripped monkey skin and dermis was only slightly higher than through intact skin. Acitretin concentration in human skin was significantly higher than in rhesus monkey or guinea-pig skin. Topical application of acitretin can produce dermal concentrations in excess of those achieved by therapeutic oral doses. "
"Abstract: In an in vitro model, the release and penetration through a silicon membrane of different cream formulations and ointments containing 0.5% dithranol were studied. The results indicated that the method is not suitable for predicting in vivo release and penetration. Experiments with rabbits showed that the degree of skin irritation produced by a hospital-prepared product containing 0.5% dithranol was comparable to that of of a commercial product. Clinical efficacy and side-effects of these two products were investigated in a double-blind left-right comparative study in 35 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. The two creams proved to be equally effective and showed the same incidence of side-effects. "
"Abstract: Sixty dogs with chronic keratoconjunctivitis sicca were treated by topical administration of 2% cyclosporine twice daily. Causes and duration of keratoconjunctivitis varied. Tear production improved in 75 of 100 eyes, and corneal pigmentation decreased in 45 of 67 eyes. Six factors were evaluated to determine their influence on treatment outcome. The only significant variable was the initial Schirmer tear test value. Side effects were few. Evidence of burning in response to application of cyclosporine resolved with change in the formulation of the topical solution. "
"Abstract: Transdermal drug delivery system has been in existence for a long time. In the past, the most commonly applied systems were topically applied creams and ointments for dermatological disorders. The occurrence of systemic side-effects with some of these formulations is indicative of absorption through the skin. A number of drugs have been applied to the skin for systemic treatment. In a broad sense, the term transdermal delivery system includes all topically administered drug formulations intended to deliver the active ingredient into the general circulation. Transdermal therapeutic systems have been designed to provide controlled continuous delivery of drugs via the skin to the systemic circulation. The relative impermeability of skin is well known, and this is associated with its functions as a dual protective barrier against invasion by micro-organisms and the prevention of the loss of physiologically essential substances such as water. Elucidation of factors that contribute to this impermeability has made the use of skin as a route for controlled systemic drug delivery possible. Basically, four systems are available that allow for effective absorption of drugs across the skin. The microsealed system is a partition-controlled delivery system that contains a drug reservoir with a saturated suspension of drug in a water-miscible solvent homogeneously dispersed in a silicone elastomer matrix. A second system is the matrix-diffusion controlled system. The third and most widely used system for transdermal drug delivery is the membrane-permeation controlled system. A fourth system, recently made available, is the gradient-charged system. Additionally, advanced transdermal carriers include systems such as iontophoretic and sonophoretic systems, thermosetting gels, prodrugs, and liposomes. Many drugs have been formulated in transdermal systems, and others are being examined for the feasibility of their delivery in this manner (e.g., nicotine antihistamines, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, contraceptives, anti-arrhythmic drugs, insulin, antivirals, hormones, alpha-interferon, and cancer chemotherapeutic agents). Research also continues on various chemical penetration enhancers that may allow delivery of therapeutic substances. For example, penetration enhancers such as Azone may allow delivery of larger-sized molecules such as proteins and polypeptides. "
"Abstract: The clinical and histologic effects of a new emollient cream formulation of topical tretinoin at concentrations of 0.05% and 0.01% were examined in 251 subjects with mild to moderate photodamaged facial skin in a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multicenter study. Seventy-nine percent of the subjects who received 0.05% tretinoin for 24 weeks showed overall improvement in photodamaged skin compared with improvement in 48% of the vehicle-treated control subjects. Significant reductions were found in fine wrinkling, mottled hyperpigmentation, roughness, and laxity after 0.05% tretinoin therapy when compared with controls. In addition, histologic changes of increased epidermal thickness, decreased melanin content, and stratum corneum compaction provide independent evidence supporting clinical improvement. Side effects of erythema, peeling, and stinging were usually mild and well tolerated. "
"Abstract: Patient-applied formulations of 0.5% podofilox (podophyllotoxin) were evaluated for the treatment of external genital warts in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Seventy-two women were enrolled and, using a randomized, computer-generated list, assigned to receive either active drug or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Patients were instructed to apply the medication to their external warts twice each day for 3 consecutive days, followed by 4 days without treatment. This cycle was repeated at weekly intervals for a maximum of 4 weeks (and a minimum of 2 weeks). Patients were evaluated weekly for the first month and then at weeks 6 and 10. The number of warts present was recorded and the overall improvement was assessed. The treated area was examined, the patients were questioned about any adverse effects, and standard hematologic/biochemical studies were conducted. The final results showed that podofilox cleared 74% of the total wart count, compared with an 18% regression in the placebo group (P less than .001). The investigators' assessments of improvement correctly distinguished active drug from placebo at every observation point. Local untoward effects were minor and transient. There was no evidence of systemic effects. It is concluded that patient-applied podofilox is a safe and effective therapy for genital condylomata in women. When available, this drug will simplify the treatment of genital warts by providing a patient-applied alternative therapy. "
"Abstract: The influence of liposomes on the photostabilization of riboflavin in an aqueous formulation was studied under fluorescent light at various conditions. Liposomal composition, concentration, pH, and ionic strength were varied. The photostability of riboflavin was found to increase in the presence of neutral and negatively-charged liposomes but to decrease in association with positively-charged liposomes. Furthermore, increasing the concentration of dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) in the composition of the liposomes resulted in an enhancement in the photostability of riboflavin such that at 5.8mM DMPC concentration a 2.3 fold increase in photostability was observed compared to control buffer solution. The pH of the medium influenced the photostability of riboflavin. However, the ionic strength of solution appeared to demonstrate no significant effect. The photodegradation reactions appeared to follow first-order kinetics in the presence and absence of liposomes. "
"Abstract: Skin absorption of benzoyl peroxide from a topical lotion containing freely dispersed drug was compared with that from the same lotion in which the drug was entrapped in a controlled-release styrene-divinylbenzene polymer system. In an in vitro diffusion system, statistically significant (p = 0.01) differences were found in the content of benzoyl peroxide in excised human skin and in percutaneous absorption. In vivo, significantly (p = 0.002) less benzoyl peroxide was absorbed through rhesus monkey skin from the polymeric system. This controlled release of benzoyl peroxide to skin can alter the dose relation that exists between efficacy and skin irritation. Corresponding studies showed reduced skin irritation in cumulative irritancy studies in rabbits and human beings, whereas in vivo human antimicrobial efficacy studies showed that application of the formulations containing entrapped benzoyl peroxide significantly reduced counts of Propionibacterium acnes (p less than 0.001) and aerobic bacteria (p less than 0.001) and the free fatty acid/triglyceride ratio in skin lipids. These findings support the hypothesis that, at least for this drug, controlled topical delivery can enhance safety without sacrificing efficacy. "
"Abstract: This study compared the pulpal responses to two innovative semihydrous glass ionomer luting cements (STA and ZIN) with those previously obtained for a conventional anhydrous glass ionomer luting cement, Aquacem. ZIN contained zinc oxide in the formulation. The study was conducted according to the BSI (1989) recommendations for testing restorative materials in vivo. ZIN was associated with minimal pulpal changes and microbial microleakage, and differed little from the control material, Kalzinol. The pulpal response to STA was similar to that observed for Aquacem, but was associated with less microbial microleakage. The statistical model demonstrated a significant association between bacterial presence within the experimental cavity and pulpal inflammation. The closer that bacteria were to the pulp, the more severe was the ensuing inflammation. "
"Abstract: Ondansetron represents a new class of drugs that exert their antiemetic activity by selective inhibition of a serotonin receptor subtype (5-HT3). Ondansetron has marked activity against emesis associated with cisplatin and other highly emetogenic drugs. Compared with high doses of metoclopramide, the antiemetic ""gold standard,"" it demonstrates equal or superior efficacy. Although ondansetron is moderately well absorbed after oral administration, only a parenteral formulation will initially be available. Ondansetron is eliminated almost entirely by hepatic metabolism; less than five percent of an intravenously administered dose is recovered intact in urine. The half-life of ondansetron is approximately 3.5 hours; slightly shorter in children and prolonged in the elderly. Neither clinical efficacy nor adverse effects have correlated with serum concentrations. Ondansetron is generally well tolerated. Clinically relevant adverse effects include headache, diarrhea or constipation, sedation, and transient minor elevations of liver function tests. It is not associated with extrapyramidal reactions. Ondansetron is indicated as prophylaxis for nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic chemotherapy. Studies to further evaluate and define its use are ongoing. "
"Abstract: Maximal dosing of cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs is often limited by the development of severe nonmyelosuppressive toxicities. Numerous studies have demonstrated that sulfur-containing nucleophiles can antagonize the dose-limiting effects of alkylating agents on the genitourinary tract. Examples include the use of sodium thiosulfate to prevent cisplatin-induced renal tubular necrosis and the use of sulfhydryl-containing compounds like N-acetylcysteine and 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (mesna) to block oxazophosphorine-induced bladder toxicity. Mesna does not block the antitumor action of oxazophosphorines due to its rapid formation of the inactive dimer dimesna in the bloodstream. The active monomer is selectively reduced from dimesna in renal tubule cells, thereby limiting the inactivation of toxins like acrolein to the genitourinary tract. Recent clinical trials suggest that oral mesna has adequate bioavailability (roughly 50% by urinary thiol measurements) to prevent urotoxicity in high-dose ifosfamide regimens. In addition, mesna is stable in aqueous oral formulations. This may facilitate more convenient oral mesna dosing in protocols using high-dose cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide. Whereas agents like mesna and sodium thiosulfate complex directly with activated (electrophilic) alkylator species, chemoprotectants for the anthracyclines appear to complex with metal cofactors like iron, which are required for the production of cardiotoxicity. Several ethylenediaminetetraacetic-like agents have been evaluated, and a water-soluble piperazinyl derivative, ICRF-187, is currently undergoing clinical evaluation in patients receiving large cumulative doxorubicin doses. An initial clinical trial suggests that ICRF-187 can prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. As with mesna, ICRF-187 does not block the myelosuppressive or the antitumor effects of doxorubicin. Overall, these studies show that site-selective chemoprotection is now feasible for at least two major classes of anticancer agents. "
"Abstract: Each person makes the decision of how best to care for his or her own skin. Among the prime concerns, especially for facial skin, is the type of dirt, debris, or make-up to be removed. In most cases, all products do an adequate job in the removal of dirt; if not, the washing techniques can be modified to accomplish the task at hand. What cannot be controlled are the adverse side effects inherent in the use of that product. These adverse properties include damages to the barrier function of the skin; increased susceptibility to environmental sources of irritation and sensitization; frank irritation responses, such as erythema and edema; and reduction of the cosmetic qualities of the skin, such as degree of moisture and smoothness. Part of the problem is that most of these changes are subtle, occurring slowly over time. Often, the association of these problems with the use of a particular facial cleansing regimen is overlooked. The typical woman uses as many as 10 to 15 facial cosmetic and cleansing products each day, making the identification of a problem even more difficult. It is important to identify the risks associated with individual products and with product categories in general. Although the identification of a safe group of products to use for facial cleansing is desirable, the results of this investigation indicate that there are no simple answers. It has been assumed that because moisturizing cream formulations are routinely safe and mild in general use, a cleansing product in the same general form would share these attributes. We can see from the results in Table 2 and Figures 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 that cleansing creams are not uniformly superior to cleansing bars in the key attributes that are used to evaluate mildness. In each evaluation there were individual cleansing creams that demonstrated statistically weaker performance than did cleansing bars in general. As a group, cleansing creams did well in the cosmetic categories of dryness and texture but surprisingly poorly in such indicators of clinical safety as erythema and TEWL. Further evaluation of the components of the facial-washing regimens proposed by the manufacturers of many of the cleansing-cream products involved the direct comparison of a cleansing cream against that same product used with an alcohol-based toning product. In all cases, the addition of alcohol-based products to the cleaning protocol reduced the cosmetic and clinical safety of the regimen (see Table 2 and Figures 3, 5, 7, and 9).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "
"Abstract: The efficacy of Peroxyl mouthrinse in reducing the extrinsic stain produced by Peridex, a chlorhexidine mouthrinse, was evaluated in a double-blind, three-month clinical study. Intraoral safety, extrinsic tooth stain and plaque accumulation scores were determined on 119 healthy adult subjects at baseline and at 30-, 60- and 90-day intervals following use of Peroxyl or placebo formulations in combination with the Peridex product. Subjects were randomly assigned to two groups. The test group used the chlorhexidine mouthrinse plus Peroxyl mouthrinse, while the control group used the chlorhexidine mouthrinse plus a placebo mouthrinse. All participants were given an oral prophylaxis prior to use of the mouthrinses. The assigned mouthrinse combinations were used by 58 test and 61 control subjects, who followed specific toothbrushing and mouthrinse regimens throughout the three-month period. Both the examiner and the subjects were unaware of the identities of the products tested. Use of Peroxyl mouthrinse significantly reduced extrinsic tooth stain produced by chlorhexidine rinsing. The mean stain scores for all teeth were significantly lower for the Peroxyl/chlorhexidine group, at 60 and 90 days of use, compared to the placebo/chlorhexidine group. At all three time points, the mean stain scores of the anterior teeth of the individuals using Peroxyl/chlorhexidine rinses had significantly less stain compared to the placebo/chlorhexidine rinse group means. No intraoral soft tissue side effects, attributed to product use, were observed or reported throughout the study. "
"Abstract: Since oral cyclosporin A (CsA) has demonstrated its effectiveness in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, efforts have been made to develop a topical CsA formulation, thus avoiding systemic adverse events. A limited number of publications are available on the use of topical CsA in allergic contact dermatitis and atopic dermatitis. Moreover the response rate of humans to topical CsA is about 50% or less. We now report our results with three new topical CsA formulations on allergic contact dermatitis and atopic dermatitis. No significant improvement was found in 16 atopic dermatitis patients and 7 allergic contact dermatitis (nickel sulphate) patients. "
"Abstract: Eczema craquelé can be induced by repeated open application of a topical glucocorticoid, viz. 0.05% clobetasole 17-propionate cream. This might not be invariably due to the active component. Comparison of the skin surface roughness as assessed by profilometry and as expressed by RZDIN showed a decrease after repeated open application of 0.1% betamethasone 17-valerate cream and 0.25% prednicarbate cream, but an increase following the vehicle of the latter preparation. Thus commercial oil-in-water emulsion preparations seem to be potentially injurious to human skin, though this may be masked when a glucocorticoid is added. "
"Abstract: From September 1984 to July 1986, 70 previously untreated patients with Stage II to IV intermediate- or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (according to the International Working Formulation) were enrolled in a phase III comparative trial. The objectives of the study were to compare the efficacy and safety of using mitoxantrone instead of doxorubicin in the combination chemotherapeutic regimen m-BACOD (intermediate-dose methotrexate, bleomycin, Adriamycin [doxorubicin, Adria Laboratories], cyclophosphamide, Oncovin [vincristine, Eli Lilly and Company], and dexamethasone). Seventy patients were randomly assigned to receive either m-BN (Novantrone; mitoxantrone, American Cyanamid Company) COD or m-BACOD. The complete-response rate was 57% in both treatment groups, and no significant differences in overall or relapse-free survival were recorded between the two groups. Patients treated with m-BACOD experienced severe alopecia more frequently (P less than .001) and reported six adverse cardiac events of grade greater than 1 whereas neither was observed among those receiving m-BNCOD. The mitoxantrone-containing regimen was found to have an equivalent efficacy and reduced clinical toxicity in comparison to the standard doxorubicin-containing regimen in patients with poor-prognosis non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. "
"Abstract: Cyclosporine A, a unique immunomodulatory agent, has been used increasingly over the last 5 years in the management of severe psoriasis. The remarkable efficacy of this drug coupled with its known immunosuppressive properties have enabled a further appreciation of the role of the immune system in the induction and maintenance of psoriatic plaques. Although acting primarily on T lymphocytes, there is also evidence for an effect of cyclosporine A on other constitutive cell types within the skin. The future use of systemically administered cyclosporine A in the treatment of psoriasis and other cutaneous diseases is dependent on the successful balance of efficacy and side-effect profile; namely, the dose-related problems of hypertension and nephrotoxicity. As a result of the toxicity encountered with systemically administered cyclosporine A, attempts to formulate a successful topical preparation for use in cutaneous disease are being made. The advent of cyclosporine A provides the dermatologist with a new therapeutic strategem in the management of psoriasis, although the long-term safety of such interventional therapy remains to be discerned. "
"Abstract: Promethazine, available by prescription only since its introduction in 1946, has been widely used for pediatric patients because of its antihistaminic, antiemetic, and sedative properties. Recently, it's makers have sought Federal Drug Administration approval to introduce two liquid over the counter allergy/cold/cough products containing promethazine as an active ingredient. Although millions of doses have been administered, promethazine use has not been free of risk. Promethazine has been reported to cause significant sedation, agitation, hallucinations, seizures, dystonic reactions, and possibly apparent life-threatening events or sudden infant death syndrome. The impact of these relatively uncommon adverse reactions on children would be minimal if parents would use over the counter promethazine only for appropriate indications and only in children greater than 2 years of age. However, according to results of research evaluating the use of various over the counter medications by families for their children, promethazine will be used inappropriately. Both its over the counter status, implying a certain margin of safety, and its formulation as a syrup, providing ease of administration, should increase its use in all age groups including that by children less than 2 years of age who may be most vulnerable to the adverse reactions associated with the drug's use. "
Abstract: Studies in animal models of enterocolitis have failed to confirm the purported metabolic and functional benefits of bowel rest induced by use of an elemental diet. Recent reports have demonstrated that glutamine-supplemented diets ameliorate or reverse many of the adverse effects of experimentally induced enterocolitis. Human studies are needed to confirm these findings. 
"Abstract: Effective topical antimicrobial agents decrease infection and mortality in burn patients. Chlorhexidine phosphanilate (CHP), a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, has been evaluated as a topical burn wound dressing in cream form, but preliminary clinical trials reported that it was painful upon application. This study compared various concentrations of CHP to determine if a tolerable concentration could be identified with retention of antimicrobial efficacy. Twenty-nine burn patients, each with two similar burns which could be separately treated, were given pairs of treatments at successive 12-h intervals over a 3-day period. One burn site was treated with each of four different CHP concentrations, from 0.25 per cent to 2 per cent, their vehicle, and 1 per cent silver sulphadiazine (AgSD) cream, an antimicrobial agent frequently used for topical treatment of burn wounds. The other site was always treated with AgSD cream. There was a direct relationship between CHP concentration and patients' ratings of pain on an analogue scale. The 0.25 per cent CHP cream was closest to AgSD in pain tolerance; however, none of the treatments differed statistically from AgSD or from each other. In addition, ease of application of CHP creams was less satisfactory than that of AgSD. It was concluded that formulations at or below 0.5 per cent CHP may prove acceptable for wound care, but the vehicle system needs pharmaceutical improvement to render it more tolerable and easier to use.

"Abstract: Sunscreens are agents that attenuate the effects of ultraviolet radiation on the skin by absorption or reflection of part of the incident radiation or by interception of harmful products of its interaction with the Sunscreens may be applied topically or ingested; however, topical agents are by far the more common and effective and only they will be discussed in this report. Topical sunscreens are formulated as creams or lotions and are characterized by their sun protection factor, a measure of their efficacy against sunburning and their substantivity, their resistance against removal after application.

"Abstract: In a placebo controlled double-blind multicenter trial, 245 patients with bronchial asthma (131 male and 124 female patients) between 6 and 51 years of age were treated in two parallel groups. A slow-release oral formulation containing 2 mg of ketotifen or placebo was administered daily for a duration of 12 weeks. Over a period of four weeks before the study, 94 percent of the patients had asthmatic attacks. 78 percent had cough, and 62 percent had nasal symptoms. In the group treated with slow-release oral ketotifen, there were 3.9 asthmatic attacks (range, 0 to 20) per week, and in the placebo group, there were 2.9 (range, 0 to 12) (mean values during four weeks prior to start of treatment). At the end of treatment, asthmatic attacks were significantly reduced in the group treated with slow-release oral ketotifen compared with placebo. Significant reduction was also evident for cough and sputum production, as well as nasal discharge and obstruction; however, slow-release oral ketotifen did not significantly improve pulmonary function indices when compared to placebo. The use of concomitant medication (beta-sympathomimetic drugs) was also significantly reduced in the group receiving slow-release oral ketotifen. The overall efficacy assessed by the investigators was ""very good"" and ""good"" in 76 percent of the group receiving slow-release oral ketotifen and 30 percent in the group receiving placebo (p less than 0.001). Tolerability rated by the investigators was ""very good"" and ""good"" in 90 percent of the group with slow-release oral ketotifen and in 96 percent of the group with placebo (p less than 0.10). The most frequent side effects were ""mild"" and ""moderate"" sedation, sleepiness and drowsiness reported in 44 percent of the patients receiving slow-release oral ketotifen and in 26 percent of the patients receiving placebo. This difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). "
"Abstract: Twenty-four patients consulting their general practitioner with eye irritation due to hayfever entered a seven-day open, multiple dose study of a newly formulated Optrex Eye Lotion. Patients self-administered Optrex by irrigation into their left eye three times daily for seven days, with an option to use the same preparation in their right eye if they thought this to be of benefit. Assessment was by means of daily diary cards completed by the patient each evening for the seven-day period. Following the first instillation, the treated eye felt significantly better at 20 seconds and at four minutes when compared with the untreated eye. Differences between the eyes for degree of redness, comfort and clearness of vision were not significant, but 15 patients (63 per cent) optionally used Optrex in their right eye. Seventeen patients (71 per cent) reported that they derived overall benefit from the use of Optrex Eye Lotion during the study period. Two patients reported side effects during the study but, in each case, the investigator did not consider the event to be therapy related. One patient withdrew on Day 7 of the trial due to worsening of their allergic conjunctivitis. It can be concluded that some subjective benefit was gained by the majority of patients in that a considerable number of them chose to treat both eyes for the duration of the study. "
"Abstract: Ten patients with chronic widespread plaque psoriasis, all of whom had previously completely cleared and suffered a subsequent widespread relapse after conventional PUVA therapy, were treated with a modified UVA dosage schedule, with psoralen formulation and dosage unchanged. Initial and incremental UVA doses were maximized to near-erythemogenic levels as determined by weekly testing for minimal phototoxic dose (MPD), treatment being given three times a week. A comparison of complete psoriasis clearing between the modified treatment and the last PUVA course showed a geometric mean reduction in treatment duration of 55% (P less than 0.001) for a similar number of treatments each week, and a cumulative UVA dose of 31% (P less than 0.05), representing a reduction in treatment duration from 9.1 to 4.1 weeks and cumulative UVA dose reduction of 100.8 to 69.9 J/cm2. Such an improvement in efficiency permits a marked increase in treated patient numbers for the same cost, and is more convenient. The reduction in the total cumulative UVA dose given as larger individual doses also seems likely to lead to a lower incidence of cutaneous long-term, especially carcinogenic, adverse effects. "
"Abstract: The effects of bergapten-containing preparations in sunlight-induced skin pigmentation were evaluated. Oil and lotion vehicles with bergapten/UV-B sunscreen or sunscreen alone were applied to the backs of subjects twice weekly for 4 weeks and the subjects were exposed to gradually increasing doses of midday sunlight. The degree of skin darkening was assessed by clinical examination, reflectometry, and light microscopy of skin biopsy specimens. At 5 weeks, 1 week after the last sunlight exposure, the sites treated with either the bergapten/UV-B sunscreen lotion or the lotion vehicle were significantly darker than the sites treated with the sunscreen lotions without bergapten. Oil preparations produced less clearcut results, possibly because of a less potent sunscreen or because the bergapten did not leave the vehicle and absorb into the epidermis. In type I skin, the bergapten/sunscreen and the oil vehicle alone produced the same amount of tanning; both yielded more tanning than the sunscreen in oil by clinical examination. The findings were not confirmed by reflectometry or by light microscopy. Thus, we conclude that bergapten added to a UV-B sunscreen lotion preparation can increase skin pigmentation over the sunscreen alone when one is exposed to sunlight. The bergapten/UV-B sunscreen combination is a potentially useful product since one can develop a psoralen and UV-A-induced tan while being protected from UV-B-induced sunburn by the UV-B sunscreen incorporated into the formulation.

"Abstract: During the developmental stages of sunscreen formulation it is desirable to have a simple, accurate and inexpensive biological model to test product effectiveness. Another desirable attribute is a quantitative, unbiased response endpoint for evaluation. We have developed such a test system based upon the ear swelling response of hairless albino mice. With this system, irradiation times are greatly reduced; furthermore, the response parameter is metric and can be determined noninvasively with an inexpensive micrometer. Protection factors determined with the mouse ear model show high correlation with the sun protection factors as determined on human subjects (r = 0.92) and were linearly related over a wide range of values. This new method affords a simple, accurate and inexpensive system for evaluation of efficacy and safety of new products. "
"Abstract: We have used a specially modified xenon arc solar simulator to examine ultraviolet A (UVA) protection of a research sunscreen formulation. UVA doses were given to sunscreen-protected and unprotected skin with the use of irradiance values of 50 mW/cm2 and 100 mW/cm2. Erythemal responses were evaluated 5.2 +/- 0.9 hours later and again 24.4 +/- 1.8 hours later. The overall mean unprotected UVA minimal erythema dose (MED) was 23.6 joules/cm2 (SD = 4.8) and the mean UVA protection factor (APF) was 3.2 (SD = 0.78). Neither irradiance nor evaluation time significantly affected MED or APF. These preliminary findings indicate that the modified solar simulator permits convenient determination of sunscreen APF. The APF of a sunscreen is analogous to SPF: APF refers to UVA protection, while SPF refers to protection from the entire solar spectrum, predominantly from the effects of UVB. "
"Abstract: A human sunburn cell (SBC) count is used to evaluate the reduction in UV-induced skin damage achieved by a highly protective sunscreen formulation containing 3 filters and reflective pigments (sun protection factor 34). Results indicate that, for the same minimal erythema level, SBC counts do not significantly differ between protected and unprotected skin, showing that the very high efficacy demonstrated against actinic erythema also extends to UV-induced skin damage. "
"Abstract: A new dithranol formulation (Dithranol-Biogram), in which the dithranol is microencapsulated by crystalline monoglycerides, has been developed. This stable formulation has pharmaceutical and cosmetic properties which overcome several draw-backs associated with conventional dithranol preparations. The clinical efficacy and side-effects of Dithranol-Biogram were compared to a conventional ex-tempore formulation in the treatment of 33 patients at a day-care centre. The study was designed as a randomized, single-blind, within-patient comparison. Patients were treated 4 times weekly for up to 6 weeks. Each session started with suberythematous UV-B doses followed by application of 1% dithranol for 20 min. There was no difference in clinical efficacy between treatments. Within 2-6 weeks the lesions in 21 of the 33 patients were classified as healed. The average reduction in severity score was 39%, 62% and 79% after 2, 4 and 6 weeks, respectively. The incidence of perilesional irritation was, however, several times higher for the ex-tempore treated sides. At the end of the study 21 patients preferred the Dithranol-Biogram formulation, 6 the ex-tempore formulation and 6 had no preference. The results of this study suggest that this novel formulation may become an important contribution to the management of psoriasis. "
"Abstract: Two comparable groups of 15 out-patients with symmetrical plaque psoriasis were included in an open right-left comparison study. Paraffin based, 3% dithranol (anthralin) sticks (Ditrastick), Orion Pharmaceutica, Espoo, Finland) and 0.5-1% dithranol in white petrolatum were used in combination with UVB. Both suberythema doses and MED doses were used and the effect of UVB-pretreatment was studied. Pretreatment with UVB and combination therapy with dithranol using suberythema doses of UVB seems to decrease dithranol irritation and shorten the treatment time. Preliminary results are given. "
"Abstract: In the period from 1983 through 1986, 365 consecutive patients suspected as having allergic contact dermatitis were tested for reaction to Kathon CG. This test was positive in 20 of these patients: irritant responses in 7 and allergic sensitivity in 13. Provocative use testing was positive in 1 of the 3 allergic patients tested. The characteristics of this group of patients include having a mean age older than that of the general population or of our population of dermatologic patients, having histories of long-standing dermatitis, and reporting exposure to various leave-on formulations. Our rate of positive tests, 3.6%, is similar to that reported by other investigators, although sensitivity testing results differ from center to center. It is recommended that, in certain clinical situations, caution be exercised in the unsupervised use of leave-on products containing Kathon CG. "
"Abstract: Mometasone furoate (Elocon) is a newly formulated and unique medium-potency synthetic 17-heterocyclic corticosteroid. The efficacy and safety of the ointment and cream formulations (0.1 percent) of the corticosteroid, administered once daily, were compared with those of the ointment and cream formulations of fluocinolone acetonide 0.025 percent administered three times daily and triamcinolone acetonide 0.1 percent administered twice daily in four multicenter clinical studies. They were conducted involving psoriasis patients with chronic and moderate to severe disease. Evaluation of change in disease sign scores indicated that mometasone ointment, applied once daily, was significantly more effective (P less than 0.01) than fluocinolone ointment, applied three times daily, and triamcinolone ointment, applied twice daily. The cream formulation of mometasone was significantly more effective (p less than 0.001) than fluocinolone cream, applied three times daily, and equivalent to triamcinolone cream, applied twice daily. The incidence of local adverse experiences following treatment with the ointment or cream formulations of mometasone was minimal. Mometasone ointment and cream provide a highly effective once-a-day treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis with minimal risk of side effects. "

"Abstract: More than 10 years ago, diflucortolone valerate (Nerisone, Nerisona) was introduced in Germany and soon after in Asian countries in a concentration of 0.1% in cream, ointment and fatty ointment bases. 897 patients were included in the first Southeast Asian multicentre trial with these 3 formulations, and good efficacy and tolerability combined with a rapid onset of effect were shown. These results were confirmed later in Indonesia in an extended follow-up trial which included 1295 patients. A combination of 0.1% diflucortolone valerate with 1.0% chlorquinaldol was introduced after a multicentre Southeast Asian trial involving 8668 patients with inflammatory or allergic skin conditions for which a supplementary anti-infective treatment, for prophylaxis or therapy, was considered to be indicated. Excellent results were obtained in terms of efficacy, tolerability and cosmetic properties. A randomised double-blind trial comparing this preparation with a so-called 'shotgun' combination containing 0.05% betamethasone 17-valerate, 0.1% gentamicin, 1.0% tolnaftate and 1.0% clioquinol in 288 patients in the Philippines resulted in a better efficacy for the diflucortolone preparation in the 80 patients with bacterially or mycotically infected skin diseases. A 0.3% concentration of diflucortolone valerate was developed and introduced as a high potency topical corticosteroid. A trial in the Philippines which involved 143 patients with mostly severe chronic recurrent and resistant corticosteroid-responsive skin disease confirmed a pronounced clinical efficacy with a low incidence of side effects. For the treatment of inflammatory or eczematised dermatomycosis. 0.1% diflucortolone was combined with 1.0% isoconazole nitrate (Travocort). In a randomised double-blind study of 294 patients in Thailand, this preparation was compared with a plain 1.0% clotrimazole formulation. The results were significantly better for the diflucortolone plus isoconazole nitrate combination in terms of remission of symptoms, and after 1 week the mycological cure rates were also better, as shown in potassium hydroxide and culture investigations. It is concluded, therefore, that diflucortolone valerate in the available galenic bases and in effective combinations with other agents has been proven in extensive clinical trials to be a valuable therapeutic tool in dermatological practice.

"Abstract: The efficacy of a sunscreen containing an investigational drug, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane in combination with padimate O against the erythemogenic effect of ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation was evaluated in two double-blind studies involving subjects sensitized with topical 8-methoxypsoralen. UVA radiation was supplied from either a filtered solar simulator (indoors) or filtered sunlight (outdoors). Five formulations were tested: 3% butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane and 7% padimate O, 7% padimate O, 5% octyl salicylate, and 3% oxybenzone, 3% butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane alone, 7% padimate O alone, and vehicle. Sunscreen protection against the erythemogenic effect of UVA radiation was expressed as phototoxic protection factors. The phototoxic protection factor for each sunscreen was derived from a ratio of the minimal phototoxic dose of UVA radiation that produced delayed erythema on sunscreen-protected and unprotected skin. The combination of 3% butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane and 7% padimate O provided significantly greater protection than the other sunscreen formulations, and for each sunscreen the phototoxic protection factors determined indoors and outdoors were comparable.

"Abstract: In this brief review, clinically relevant practical aspects of topical protection against the harmful effects of solar radiation on human skin are discussed. The article covers information in the following areas of photo-protection: nature of solar radiation; classification of normal individuals into sun-reactive skin types I-VI; minimal erythema doses of UVB and UVA radiation for individuals of skin types I-VI; classification of sunscreens and SPF values of brand-name sunscreens; a list of UVB- and UVA-absorbing chemicals used in sunscreen formulations in the USA; guidelines for recommending topical sunscreens for the prevention of sunburn, skin photoaging, and skin cancer; and concerns about the harmful effects of UVA radiation and tanning parlors on human skin and the methods used to minimize the potential damaging effects of UVA.

"Abstract: The results of 2 consecutive and prospective trials with specifically devised chemotherapy regimens in elderly patients (pts) with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) are reported. Between August 1979 and September 1984, 66 pts aged 70 or older (median 75 years) with NHL entered 2 consecutive trials, the former with single agent teniposide 100 mg/m2 i.v. weekly (41 pts), the latter with etoposide and prednimustine (E + P), 100 mg/m p.o. for 5 days every 21 days (25 pts). Forty-five pts were previously untreated, 21 previously treated. Forty-seven pts were of the intermediate and high grade groups according to the Working Formulation; 19 pts were of the low grade; 57 pts were stages III and IV, 9 pts were stages I and II. The median performance status was 70 (range 30-100). The objective response rate in the 66 evaluable pts is 53% with 38% CR; the 3-year overall, disease-free and CR survivals are 21, 12 and 40% respectively. The objective response rate in the 45 previously untreated pts is 58% with 42% CR; the 3-year overall, disease-free and CR survivals are 24, 16 and 58% respectively. The overall toxicity was mild. Severe toxicity (grade III and IV according to WHO criteria) was observed only in 16/498 courses (3.2%), with 1 toxic death (grade IV leucopenia). We experienced the usefulness of a properly orientated clinical approach to elderly pts with NHL. We suggest that a combination regimen like E + P, suitable for oral administration, may be safely employed in a large fraction of pts with NHL. "
"Abstract: Several reports have appeared on the efficacy of topically applied 0.01% or 0.1% all-trans retinoic acid (0.04-0.4 millimolar) for treatment of xerophthalmia, conjunctival squamous metaplasia, and corneal epithelial erosions in humans and animals. An observation common to many of these studies is the occurrence of an adverse reaction to retinoic acid in the form of lid margin hyperemia and blepharoconjunctivitis. Since retinoic acid is biologically active at micromolar to nanomolar concentrations, it may be possible to reduce side effects while maintaining therapeutic effectiveness by reducing the retinoic acid concentration in ophthalmic formulations. In the present study, topical 0.005% retinoic acid in petrolatum ointment reversed corneal keratinization in xerophthalmic, vitamin A-deficient rabbits in 3-4 days while 0.0005% (2 micromolar) retinoic acid ointment was effective in 4-6 days. Further clinical trials of topical retinoic acid for treatment of ocular surface disease should be conducted using micromolar concentrations of retinoic acid which are expected to maintain a therapeutic effect while reducing adverse reactions.

"Abstract: The toxic effects of methotrexate administration [20 mg/kg, bolus intraperitoneally (ip)] to rats fed a regular chow diet (n = 10) was compared with results in animals fed an elemental, chemically defined, liquid diet (n = 10) for 7 days. All animals receiving an elemental diet became anorectic and lethargic within 60 hr of methotrexate injection. All animals in this group subsequently developed enteritis and died within 150 hr. There was no clinical evidence of enteritis in rats fed a regular chow diet and mortality as zero in this group (p less than 0.001). In a second study one group of rats (n = 9) was fed a regular chow diet for 7 days; four groups were fed an elemental, chemically defined, liquid diet (n = 9 per group) for 7 days. At 24 hr and 8 hr prior to, or 24 hr after methotrexate administration, one group was refed a regular chow diet; the fourth group was maintained on an elemental liquid diet throughout the study period. All rats fed a regular chow diet survived following methotrexate injection (20 mg/kg, ip). All rats fed an elemental diet throughout the study period died. Those rats refed a regular diet 24 or 8 hr prior to methotrexate injection demonstrated a significant improvement in survival (100% in the 24-hr group, 55% in the 8-hr group). However, those animals refed a regular diet 24 hr after methotrexate injection demonstrated a 100% mortality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) "
"Abstract: Three triphasic oral contraceptive preparations are currently being widely used in the United States. These are Ortho-Novum 7/7/7 (Ortho Pharmaceutical), Tri-Norinyl (Syntex) and Triphasil (Wyeth). The hormone manipulation in these formulations more closely mimics the normal menstrual cycle and decreases the total amount of hormone delivered. These drugs were formulated to decrease menstrual irregularities and nuisance side effects and increase menstrual control, while maintaining efficacy and safety. This article describes these products, their mechanisms of action, efficacy and selected areas of concern for clinical practice in relation to side effects, safety and menstrual control. Findings and suggestions related to the therapeutic administration, patient use, counseling and management of these newer oral contraceptives will assist the nurse practitioner in providing optimum care to the consumer. Abstract: At this time 3 triphasics are widely used in the US: Ortho-Novum 7/7/7, Tri-Norinyl, and Triphasil. Ethinyl estradiol is the preferred estrogenic agent for the triphasic products. Torethindrone and levonorgestrel were chosen as the progestins for the triphasic products. It is the combined effects of estrogen and progestin in the triphasics that provide their contraceptive action. Triphasil increases both the estrogen and the progestin at midcycle; Tri-Norinyl and Ortho-Novum 7/7/7 elevate the progestin only. The midcycle surges of estrogen and luteinizing hormone are dampened, and ovulation is inhibited. The triphasics represent a 98.7% reduction in total steroid content since oral contraceptives (OCs) were introduced. An estrogen dose of 30-50 mcg will inhibit ovulation, and side effects with such a dose are considered tolerable. The triphasic OCs are in this range. An estrogen dose of 20 mcg has been tested but is slightly less effective and is not recommended. Contraceptive failures have occurred with the triphasic products. In 1486 women studied, 6 pregnancies have occurred. Of these failures, one may have been because of a drug interaction with a barbituate. 1 pregnancy was due to patient failure; 3 consecutive pills were missed. Only 2 pregnancies were certain drug failures. Because of the gentle suppression of ovarian function, it has been observed that the menstrual flow is less affected than by standard OCs. Due to the fact that less total steroid is delivered and more endometrial shedding occurs, it is hoped that the triphasic preparations will have less of a ""lingering"" effect on the return to functional fertility. Most of the published data on side effects is available from the UK, North America, and Europe on the formulation known in the US as Triphasil. Nausea, vomiting, breakthrough bleeding, weight gain, and breast tenderness appear to be the most common side effects. The major medical reasons for triphasic discontinuation include breast tenderness, weight gain, breakthrough bleeding, nausea and vomiting, headache, and increased bleeding during the 1 week of withdrawal. Rifampin and phenobarbital are examples of drugs found to decrease pill efficiency, including triphasics. Also, a triphasic may interfere with the action of another drug. The new triphasics are appropriate when starting new patients on OCs. Patient counseling is essential. Due to the low margin of error as a consequence of lesser suppression of ovarian function, the patient needs to be well instructed in how to take the pill and advised of the consequences of missed tables.

"Abstract: Administration of a chemically defined, elemental diet to rats given 20 mg/kg of methotrexate intraperitoneally has consistently resulted in a 100% mortality from severe enteritis within 156 h. This study examined the importance of specific dietary components in the etiology of this enhanced toxicity. Rats were given their respective diets for 7 days, whereupon methotrexate (20 mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally, and percent of survivors was recorded. Varying the concentration of carbohydrate as polysaccharide (0%, 50%, 100%) (n = 30) had no effect on survival. An increase in the percent of protein as polypeptide (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) (n = 50) in the elemental diet resulted in a progressively significant increase in percent survival. Addition of either fat or bulk to this elemental diet had no effect on survivorship. Serum and bile methotrexate levels of rats fed an elemental liquid diet (whether or not all of the protein was provided as polypeptide) were significantly increased from 12 to 72 h (p less than 0.03) compared with rats fed a regular Chow diet. When the protein content of the elemental liquid diet was provided as 100% polypeptide, serum and bile methotrexate levels were significantly lower at 48 h compared with the elemental diet group given 100% of protein as amino acid. Administration of methotrexate to rats fed an elemental liquid diet in which all of the protein is provided as amino acids is extremely toxic to the gastrointestinal tract, probably as a result of delayed clearance of the drug from the systemic circulation and from bile. This toxicity is alleviated by the provision of protein as polypeptide in the elemental diet. No toxicity to the drug is seen at this dose in rats fed a regular Chow diet. If these results are applicable to humans, the use of elemental liquid diets as the only source of enteral nutrition would appear contraindicated in patients receiving methotrexate. "
"Abstract: This study evaluates the protective capacity of 4 barrier creams and 2 methacrylate spray coatings against skin contact with epoxy resins. The effect of these materials on the strength and on the surface area of patch test reactions caused by epoxy resin was assessed in 11 volunteers with a known allergy to epoxy resins. Standard amounts of barrier cream and spray coating were applied on the skin. Then patch tests were carried out with epoxy resin on the pretreated sites. After 24 h patches were removed, 48 h thereafter the strength and surface area of the reactions were scored. Results were compared with the score of a control test. The use of 2 barrier creams resulted in a significant reduction of the surface area of the patch test reactions. Spray coatings significantly reduced both the strength and the surface area of the reactions. Our results suggest that methacrylate spray coatings and barrier creams may provide protection against epoxy resins during a test period of 24 h. However, the development of new formulations, adapted more specifically to this purpose, is necessary. "
"Abstract: Coal tar paints are among the products used as inside coatings for water pipes and storage tanks to retard corrosion in potable water supply systems. Four different formulations of these paints were tested in earlier work by this laboratory in the Ames mutagenesis and the mouse skin carcinogenesis bioassays. The paint most active in these assays were then tested in a particulate form in the lung adenoma assay with A/J mice. The paint was applied to clean glass plates, cured, collected and homogenized in 2% Emulphor. Doses of this coal tar suspension were administered by gavage at 1.0, 10.0 and 55.0 mg in 0.2 ml per mouse 3X weekly for 8 weeks. The total doses of coal tar paint were 24, 240, and 1320 mg/mouse. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), administered in a parallel schedule to a total dose of 6 mg/mouse, served as positive control. A negative control group received an equivalent volume of 2% Emulphor. Animals were killed at 9 months of age (8 months after first dose) and lung adenomas counted. A dose-related response, in the average number of lung tumors per mouse, was observed with the coal tar particulate. There were also squamous cell tumors of the forestomach in 42% of the mice receiving 55.0 mg coal tar paint per application. "
"Abstract: Severe enteritis and death consistently occur within 150 hours of a single intraperitoneal dose of 25 mg/kg methotrexate given to rats fed an elemental diet. Rats fed a regular chow diet show no clinical evidence of gastrointestinal morbidity or mortality at this dose. The etiology of this enhanced toxicity is not clear, however. It this study rats were randomized to receive an elemental diet (n = 45) or a regular chow diet (n = 45) for 7 days. They were then given a bolus dose of 3H methotrexate (25 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. At 20 and 40 minutes and at 1, 2, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after injection, five animals from each group were anesthetized, and mean methotrexate levels in bile and serum, and tissue methotrexate concentrations in proximal, mid, and distal small intestine and in liver were obtained. Mean methotrexate levels in bile were significantly elevated in rats fed an elemental, chemically defined diet at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours compared with regular diet fed rats. Mean serum methotrexate levels were elevated in both the inferior vena cava (IVC) and portal vein (PV) at 12 (IVC), 24 (PV), and 48 hours (IVC) in elemental, liquid diet fed rats. There were no statistical differences between methotrexate levels in rats fed an elemental diet or a regular chow diet in proximal or mid small intestine at any of the time points measured. In the distal small intestine, methotrexate levels were significantly elevated at 24 hours in rats fed an elemental, chemically defined liquid diet (P less than 0.03) compared with regular diet fed rats. Methotrexate levels in liver of rats fed an elemental, chemically defined liquid diet were significantly elevated at 24 and 48 (P less than 0.05) hours. Administration of an elemental, chemically defined liquid diet prolongs the enterohepatic circulation of methotrexate in rats and delays clearance of the drug from the systemic circulation. Thus, prolonged exposure of methotrexate to the cells of the intestinal mucosa explains the increased gastrointestinal side effects of the drug in rats fed an elemental, chemically defined liquid diet. If these results are applicable to man, elemental, chemically defined liquid diets are contraindicated as the sole nutritional source in patients receiving methotrexate. Such qualitative alteration of dietary intake may be a factor in the unpredictability of gastrointestinal side effects associated with high dose methotrexate administration. "
Abstract: Clinical efficacy of fenticonazole 2% cream has been tested on 30 patients with dermatomycoses and the 2% nebulized lotion on 10 patients with pityriasis versicolor. Treatment consisted of two topical applications of the drug for up to 5 weeks and clinical improvement and mycology were assessed at one-week intervals. Thirty-six patients (90%) were cured at the end of the 5-week period; 26 were cured from dermatomycoses and 10 from pityriasis versicolor. No recurrency/reinfection nor side-effects were encountered. The success attained by fenticonazole treatment indicates that it is a first choice drug in the therapy of superficial dermatomycoses. 
"Abstract: PUVA therapy has radically altered the management of severe psoriasis. It is of greatest benefit in those patients with extensive involvement, and in those unresponsive to conventional therapy. The long term side effects of PUVA currently limit its use to patients with disabling disease. The full extent of long term side effects has yet to be defined. In order to reduce the toxicity and improve the efficacy of PUVA, a better understanding of the molecular aspects of psoralen-DNA interaction, DNA repair, and mutagenesis is required. The action spectrum of PUVA in clearing psoriasis has yet to be defined. By limiting the spectrum of UVA exposure it may be possible to reduce some of the toxic effects of PUVA. The recent advances in the formulation of 8-MOP preparations has yielded a drug with more predictable pharmacokinetics and clinical response. Further research with newer psoralens may produce more effective and less toxic compounds. In the last ten years, PUVA has been both a valuable addition to dermatologists' clinical armamentarium and a useful tool in increasing our understanding of cellular biology and the interaction between ultraviolet radiation and biologic systems.

"Abstract: A 2.5% formulation of benzoyl peroxide was compared with its vehicle, and with a 5% and a 10% proprietary benzoyl peroxide gel preparation in three double-blind studies involving 153 patients with mild to moderately severe acne vulgaris. The 2.5% benzoyl peroxide formulation was more effective than its vehicle and equivalent to the 5% and 10% concentrations in reducing the number of inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules). Desquamation, erythema, and symptoms of burning with the 2.5% gel were less frequent than with the 10% preparation but equivalent to the 5% gel. The 2.5% formulation also significantly reduced Propionibacterium acnes and the percentage of free fatty acids in the surface lipids after 2 weeks of topical application. "
"Abstract: Melasma is a circumscribed brown macular hypermelanosis of the areas of the face and neck that are exposed to light. Clinical trials with various depigmenting formulations containing hydroquinone were conducted to determine the ideal concentration of hydroquinone, retinoic acid, and corticosteroids for the treatment of melasma. The compounds were tested with and without the concomitant use of topical sunscreen preparations. Based on the results of the trials and our earlier clinical experience, we conclude that treatment of melasma should involve the following: avoidance of sun exposure, constant use of broad-spectrum sunscreens, and topical application of a cream or lotion containing 2% hydroquinone and 0.05% to 0.1% retinoic acid (tretinoin). Patients should suspend use of oral contraceptives and other agents that promote skin pigmentation. The monobenzyl ether of hydroquinone should never be used in melasma therapy. "
"Abstract: Controversy exists as to whether administration of a chemically defined diet alters toxicity to chemotherapy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate toxicity to methotrexate in rats fed a chemically defined liquid diet or a regular chow diet. In the first study, 48 adult rats were randomized to be fed a chemically defined liquid diet or a regular diet for 14 days when methotrexate (25 or 50 mg/kg) was given. All liquid diet rats became anorexic and died within 96 h, while no deaths were observed in rats fed regular diet. When 20 liquid diet and regular diet rats were pair-fed to equalize caloric intake before and after methotrexate administration, similar mortality results occurred. In a second study, methotrexate (50 mg/kg) or saline was given and 60 h later all animals were sacrificed to obtain small bowel luminal cultures and tissue sections for histological evaluation. Administration of the liquid diet altered small bowel flora to predominantly Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas sp. and histology showed severe small bowel mucosal enteritis in comparison with regular diet rats. To evaluate whether the changes in intestinal flora or alterations in drug pharmacokinetics were responsible for the increased mortality, two additional studies were done. Gentamicin (4.8 mg/kg/day) was given p.o. or i.m. to the rats on the chemically defined liquid diet. A significant reduction of intraluminal bacteria occurred, but survival time was not improved in animals receiving antibiotics. When mean serum methotrexate levels were analyzed in non-antibiotic-treated rats, drug concentrations were significantly increased at 24, 36, and 48 h after methotrexate injection in the elemental liquid diet rats compared with chow diet rats. Administration of a chemically defined liquid diet to rats receiving methotrexate increased the occurrence and severity of intestinal enteritis, altered intraluminal bowel flora, and decreased clearance of methotrexate from the serum.

"Abstract: Continuous topical administration of dithranol and butantrone for 6 months caused different irritation profiles in miniature swine. In paraffin wax sticks in white petrolatum, butantrone gave rise to much less initial irritation than dithranol, but after 2-3 weeks the situation had equalized. In gel formulations, butantrone was initially more irritant than dithranol. The vehicles themselves induced significant irritation. Signs of skin hyperplasia (parakeratosis and acanthosis) and inflammation were frequent histopathological findings at the end of the study, but no malignant changes were found. Dithranol and butantrone did not produce any chemical, hematological or serious histological abnormalities during the treatment, suggesting a lack of systemic toxicity. No evidence of systemic absorption was found. This long-term study did not predict delayed irritation of butantrone observed in about 1/3 of the psoriatic patients after treatment for 1-2 months. "
"Abstract: Zinc deficiency during long-term total parenteral nutrition has been well reported in the literature. However, there is limited information available on zinc deficiency occurring during total enteral nutrition. Two cases of clinical zinc deficiency in patients on long-term enteral feedings are presented. Nutritional assessment of these two patients on admission revealed hypoalbuminemic malnutrition. Nutritional support in the form of nasogastric tube feedings were initiated in both patients due to altered mental status. The formula used was Ensure (Ross Labs, Columbus, OH), which provided greater than 150% of the RDA for zinc. However, four months and seven months after initiation of adequate nutritional support, both patients developed skin rashes around the groin and under the breasts and axilla. Serum zinc levels were depressed in both patients, to 42 and 54 mg/dL, respectively (normal for the authors' laboratory, 66 to 120 mg/dL). Supplementation with zinc sulfate 220 mg per day via nasogastric tube resulted in disappearance of the rash with return of serum zinc to normal levels. The authors suggest close observation of patients on long-term enteral nutrition for clinical manifestation of zinc deficiency, especially an unexplained skin rash. Further studies are needed to establish minimum daily zinc requirements in patients on long-term enteral feedings. "
"Abstract: Ten patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma primarily affecting the orbital region were evaluated at Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center, Chicago, between 1976 and 1983. Diagnoses were based on the histopathologic classification systems of the Working Formulation of the Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas and Rappoport. Sequential staging procedures performed at the time of diagnosis included liver-spleen scans, Technecium-99 bone scans, gallium 67 scans, computerized axial tomograms of the orbit and abdomen, bone marrow examination and cerebral spinal fluid analyses. Adverse prognostic factors included the following: orbital bone erosions, Stage IV disease, and large cell or mixed cell, diffuse histologic features. The type of histopathologic findings combined with the results of sequential staging procedures is useful in identifying those patients who would benefit most from systemic chemotherapy. "
"Abstract: A randomized, double-blind, left-right study to compare the therapeutic efficacy and the cosmetic acceptability of the new hydrocortisone 17-butyrate (Locoid) 0.1% fatty cream application form with desonide (Apolar) 0.1% ointment was performed in thirty patients suffering from moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The medications were applied to symmetrical, bilateral skin lesions twice daily for 4 weeks. Both treatments effected highly significant reductions of the score values for the severity of all clinical skin parameters assessed. Score reductions were, however, more pronounced on Locoid-treated sides than on Apolar-treated sides both after 2 and 4 weeks of therapy. It appeared further that clinical efficacy of treatment at completion of the study was also in favour of Locoid-treated sides, indicating that Locoid fatty cream is more effective than Apolar ointment. No serious side-effects were reported during the study. The expressed patient preferences with respect to cosmetic acceptability of treatments were significantly in favour of Locoid fatty cream, indicating that patients preferred the use of this new galenic formulation over an ointment formulation. It is concluded that the new application form of Locoid, a fatty cream, is a useful and beneficial addition to topical corticosteroid therapy, which will promote patient compliance in a wide range of corticosteroid-responsive skin diseases.

"Abstract: A bioavailability study was performed with a pill containing microcrystalline 8-MOP and a soft gelatine capsule containing dissolved 8-MOP in 35 patients receiving PUVA treatment. Peak plasma levels were almost doubled after ingestion of the capsule preparation in comparison with those recorded from the pill takers. The pharmaceutical formulation of 8-MOP preparations is of decisive importance for the bioavailability of the drug. Variations in degree of absorption from different 8-MOP preparations and the existence of a metabolic first-pass effect probably explain the great inter-patient variability in therapeutic response. It is therefore advisable to individualize the dose of 8-MOP, primarily in slow responders, with the aim of obtaining a faster clearance but also to reduce the amount of UVA light involved. "
"Abstract: Uniform 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is necessary to avoid day-to-day variations in 8-MOP plasma levels when treating patients with psoriasis by photochemotherapy. Because of its low water solubility, particle size and crystal form of the 8-MOP can significantly influence its bioavailability. The presentation form is also important, as is shown by the present study in which 8-MOP plasma levels were compared in thirty patients after oral administration in three different forms: formulation A consisted of gelatin capsules containing 8-MOP with a mean particle size of 200 mu; formulation B consisted of gelatin capsules containing 8-MOP in microcrystalline form with particle size between 20 mu and 30 mu; formulation C contained the same microcrystalline 8-MOP but in an emulsion base. Significantly higher plasma levels were found with formulations B and C than with formulation A. Furthermore, the individual differences in plasma profiles were markedly less with the emulsion base than with the capsule forms. Therefore, the clinical use of 8-MOP in emulsion form would constitute a major step in 8-MOP dose standardization and could lead to better control of subjective side effects and better therapeutic results.

"Abstract: Ketotifen (Zaditen) is a new, orally active benzocycloheptathiophene derivative for use in the prophylaxis of asthma. Besides possessing anti-allergic properties, it also has H1-receptor mediated antihistaminic activity. Drugs which block H1-receptors are known to have some sedative properties. On the other hand the bronchodilator theophylline is a CNS stimulant. We investigated whether these side-effects could be reduced by concomitant administration. In a balanced-sequence crossover study, 12 healthy males received placebo, 1 mg ketotifen + 300 mg theophylline, 1 mg ketotifen + 600 mg theophylline, and each drug separately at 1-week intervals. Quantified electroencephalograms, cardiovascular and behavioral measurements, symptom reports, and blood drug assays were used to assess the drug interaction. Results showed EEG and behavioral effects with both ketotifen and theophylline alone which were less evident with the drugs in combination. Blood drug levels were not altered by combined drug administration. These findings suggest a mutual attenuation of the CNS effects of ketotifen and theophylline at therapeutic doses and encourage their combined use in asthma therapy. The combined effect may be optimized by modifying formulations or timing. The applicability of quantitative EEG to such problems is well demonstrated. "
"Abstract: H1-antihistamines are usually associated with impairment of central nervous functions, but unacceptable decrements in performance may not be an inevitable sequel of their use. Effects are dependent on the ability of a particular drug to cross the blood brain barrier, and so compounds which cross so slowly that tolerance of the central nervous system can develop gradually without any immediate changes in performance are of interest. However, sustained release formulations and compounds which have a selective affinity for the peripheral receptor may also have their part to play in the management of allergic states in those involved in skilled activity. As far as H2-antagonists are concerned, it is likely that as they are less liposoluble they would be free of central effects. Studies on the central effects of H1 and H2 antagonists are reviewed, and tentative recommendations are made in respect of these findings concerning the possible use of these drugs in aircrew. "
"Abstract: Findings of several recent epidemiological studies of the relationship between oral contraceptives (OC) and the development of cancer were summarized. Enough time has now elapsed since the introduction of OCs to enable investigators to examine the latent and longterm effects of OC use on the development of cancer. In general recent findings indicated that OC use was not associated with the development of breast cancer breast cancer and was negatively associated with endometrial ovarian cancer. Findings in regard to cervical and liver cancer cases and melanoma were unclear. In reference to breast cancer, in a study of 1191 breast cancer cases and 5026 controls, conduct Rosenberg and others, the relative risk of breast cancer for women who ever used OCs as compared with women who never used OC was 1.0. No increased risk was observes for women who 1) used OCs for more than 5 years, even 10 years following OC discontinuance; 2) took OCs while they were nulliparous or premenopausal; 3) had a family history of benign or 1st degree breast cancer. 4735 breast cancer patients and 4685 controls were included in the recent Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study (cash) conducted by the Centers for Disease Control. Results indicated that the relative risk of breast cancer for every users of OCs compared to never users was 0.9. No increased risk was observed for women who took OCs for 10 or more or 20 or more years. No increased risk was associated with any of the OC formulations commonly available in the US. The cash data were also used to assess issues raised in 2 other studies. A Los Angeles study of 314 cases and 314 controls found that women who used high progestin OCs for 2 or more years had s significantly increased risk of developing breast cancer by age 37, and a Britidh study found that OC use of 4 or more years prior ro 1st pregnancy was associated with an increase risk of cancer by age 45. In terms of the cash data no increased risk of breast cancer by the ages specified above was observed for these 2 identically defined subgroups of OC users. Several studies found that the risk of developing ovarian cancer was reduced by 50% for OC users. Furthermore, the risk decreased as duration of OC use increased, and the protevtive effect continued for at least 10 years following discontinuation of OC use. An initial analysis of CASH data revealed that the reduced risk was associated with all types of OC formulations currently marketed in the US. Several studies found a similar reduction in the risk of endometrial cancer among OC users. According to the CASH data, the relative risk of endometrial cancer was 0.5 for women who used OC for 12 or more months compared to never users, the protective effect lasted for at least 10 years, and the reduced risk was observed for the 7 most common OCs used in US. Most studies which included OC users detected a positive relattionship between OC use and the development of cervical neoplasms however, the data in these studies is subject to selective and misclassification biases and confounding effects. Despite these problems, there is a possibility that OC use enhances the risk of cevical neoplasms and speeds up the transition from cervical dyplasia to invasive cancer. The results of studies. Taking into account the role of sun exposure, need to be undertaken. The relationship between OC use and liver tumors has not be examined epidemiologically, and this deficit should be corrected. "
"Abstract: Topical all trans retinoic acid (tretinoin) 0.1 per cent has been used to treat eight patients with squamous metaplasia and keratinisation of the conjunctiva. In four patients the changes followed Stevens-Johnson syndrome, one patient had chronic atopic kerato conjunctivitis, one had persistent epithelial erosions following sarcoid related kerato conjunctivitis sicca complicated by preservative induced epithelial toxicity, one had a recurrent Bowen like epithelial dysplasia and one had an unclassifiable primary ocular surface disorder. Improvement in symptoms and signs were noted in all patients but local irritation developed in some and the optimum dosage remains to be determined. Problems of formulation and stability of the preparation need to be solved before topical retinoid therapy can be more widely used. "
"Abstract: A group of forty-eight patients with psoriasis who were being treated with anthralin cream were examined for side effects. Based on the variables investigated, there was no evidence of any systemic toxicity or excretion of anthraquinones (detection limit 20 micrograms/ml), while clinically, patients were seen to respond satisfactorily. "
"Abstract: The role of etoposide epipodophyllotoxin (VP-16-213) in a combined modality treatment program incorporating local chest irradiation and combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, Ohio), and vincristine has been evaluated in a randomized trial of 165 patients with small-cell lung cancer. The overall response rate (complete response [CR] plus partial response [PR]) was significantly greater in the VP-16-213 arm (85% v 64%, P = .005) primarily as a consequence of improved response in patients with extensive disease (85% v 38%, P = .002 and 30% v 8% for CR only, P = .045). No differences in the response rates were observed in limited disease. The duration of response (months) was greater in the VP-16-213 arm (8.6 v 7.0 overall and 14.4 v 11.5 for CR) but not significantly so. Median survival times (months) were consistently greater in the group receiving VP-16-213 when analyzed according to extent of disease and response (10.6 v 9.5 overall; 15.0 v 13.6 for limited disease; 9.0 v 6.7 for extensive disease; 18.5 v 16.2 for CR overall; and 18.6 v 16.1 for CR in limited disease); the results were not statistically significant. The median survival of extensive disease patients attaining a CR was 15.3 months (range 3.2 to 34.3 + months) in the VP-16-213 arm and 7.4+ and 8.1+ months for the two patients with CR in the other group. Anemia and leukopenia occurred to a greater degree in the four-drug regimen, but no unusual or significant compounding toxicity (ie, neurotoxicity) was observed otherwise. Further investigation of this agent in combination chemotherapy programs for small-cell lung cancer appears to be warranted. "
"Abstract: Proper oral PUVA therapy includes the application of a psoralen drug and the administration of light, and both of these have to be adjusted to each other in regard to dose and timing. As psoralens are rather insoluble, it is difficult to produce pharmaceutical formulations which ensure safe and predictable absorption. A strong, saturable first pass effect occurs after oral intake of psoralens, resulting in a wide variability in plasma levels and thus also in phototoxicity. Phototoxicity seems to be slightly delayed compared to plasma levels in the absorption phase, but then persists much longer than plasma levels. Therefore irradiation should be done at or shortly after tmax of plasma levels. ""Skin levels"" seem to parallel plasma levels rather than the time course of cutaneous photosensitivity, which indicates that they do not represent drug concentration at the true site of action. Metabolism and first pass of TMP are very fast and thus oral intake does not result in significant plasma levels. Phototoxicity may, however, occur if TMP is administered as a solution. The present paper discusses clinically relevant aspects of psoralen drug pharmacokinetics, including absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. The shortcomings in the development of regimens for oral psoralen photochemotherapy are pointed out, and suggestions for further developments are given. Based on the pharmacokinetic data, recommendations are given for an improved performance of clinical psoralen photochemotherapy. "
"Abstract: Although contraceptive efficacy is the major reason for using oral contraceptives (OCs), other physiologic changes occur with them that can be beneficial to patients. The new, low-dose OCs are of particular interest in this regard. Abstract: Whether the differences in progestin-estrogen formulations of oral contraceptives (OCs) lead to any clinically significant differences is an important question, even though the concept of ""tailoring the pill to the patient"" has assumed less importance as the hormonal dosages have decreased. Each component can be evaluated individually, but it is often difficult to predict the result of their combined action. All of the new low-dose formulations contain the same estrogen, ethinyl estradiol (EE). Although the type of progestin in low-dose OCs is probably of little significance for efficacy and cycle control, it may be more important in regard to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Combined OC therapy acts simultaneously at various levels of the reproductive system, and contraceptive efficacy of pills with less than 50 mcg of estrogen probably results from these combined actions. The action of estrogen and progesterone is synergistic: the sustained estrogen component exerts negative feedback on gonadotropin secretion, provides stability to the endometrium, and increases the potency of the progestational agent, while progestin can influence only estrogen-primed tissue. The progestin suppresses luteinizing hormone secretion; in addition, progestational influence dominates estrogenic influence in affecting the remainder of the reproductive system. Previous OC usage may delay pregnancy by several months but does not impair longterm fertility potential or increase congenital anomalies or abortions if conception occurs subsequent to the 1st post-pill cycle. Breakthrough bleeding, which occurs in 15% of users, is the single most frequent cause of pill discontinuation but appears to be of no medical consequence. Breakthrough bleeding and amenorrhea may be controlled by changing the pill formulation. Depression has been reported in 5% of OC users, but pill use appears to alleviate premenstrual tension. The individual patient's risk-benefit ratio must be considered when noncontraceptive uses of the pill are contemplated. OC use has been cited as a cure for dysmenorrhea, although the mechanism is uncertain. The possible preservation of fertility or prevention of progression of endometriosis with cyclic pill use should be investigated. The controlled sloughing of a uniformily thinning endometrium prevents and controls dysfunctional uterine bleeding, endometrial hyperplasia, and the anemia that results. Use of OCs has been recommended in treatment of hirsutism to suppress ovarian function when the hypersecretion of androgens is documented. Since both adrenal and ovarian androgens are often involved in hirsutism, the combined suppressive actions of OCs frequently are beneficial. Estrogens also decrease sebum production and often result in indirect acne improvement. Cyclic estrogen-progesterone therapy is recommended for inducing sexual maturation in primary amenorrhea secondary to gonadal failure. "
"Abstract: Conventional adhesive ointments cause irritation to the mucous membranes. Therefore, a novel mucosal adhesive ointment based partly on neutralized polymethacrylic acid methyl ester was formulated. The flow curves of the ointment vehicle showed pseudoplastic properties. The rheological behavior as well as the adhesion on the mucosal membrane could be varied by the type and concentration of the polymer used and the base used for neutralization. During clinical studies, the ointment vehicle as well as a tretinoin (vitamin A acid) preparation for the treatment of lichen planus did not cause any local irritation or systemic side effects. Both vehicle and preparation were found to be pleasant for the patients to use. The new system of the mucosal adhesive ointment is not limited to the incorporation of tretinoin as the active agent; combined with other drugs the system could be applied to all types of mucosal membranes. "
"Abstract: A new encapsulated liquid preparation of methoxsalen (8-MOP) and a commonly used crystalline preparation (Oxsoralen) were compared in 12 subjects. Each subject ingested 0.6 mg/kg body weight of each formulation on different days. Six subjects ingested a low-fat meal before ingestion of drug, and 6 subjects ingested a high-fat meal. Photosensitivity was tested from 1/2 to 6 h after ingestion of 8-MOP by exposure to 320-400 nm radiation (UVA) from a filtered xenon are lamp. A series of graduated doses of UVA were administered at each time point to determine the minimum phototoxic dose (MPD). Ingestion of 8-MOP and grading of erythema were conducted in a double-blind manner, and bilaterally symmetrical exposure sites were used to test each preparation. The phototoxic reaction was observed at 24, 48, and 72 h by two experienced observers who were unaware which formulation had been ingested. The two test days were separated by 48 h. The encapsulated liquid preparation induced greater photosensitivity than Oxsoralen (mean MPDs +/- SD: 7.1 +/- 4.7 vs 12.9 +/- 6.7 J/cm2, respectively; n = 12; p less than 0.05). The encapsulated liquid preparation also induced photosensitivity earlier than Oxsoralen (mean hours after ingestion to achieve peak photosensitivity +/- SD: 2.1 +/- 1.2 vs 3.9 +/- 1.6, respectively; n = 9; borderline significance). On a low-fat diet the encapsulated liquid peaked 2.5 h earlier than Oxsoralen, as well as showing the shortest and the most predictable period of photosensitivity. However, overall, the degree and time of peak photosensitivity induced by either preparation were unaffected by diet. Ingestion of the encapsulated liquid induced photosensitivity in all 12 subjects; Oxsoralen failed to sensitize 3 subjects. Side effects were similar after both preparations. A new encapsulated liquid preparation of 8-MOP may thus allow lower doses of UVA to achieve therapeutic results in photochemotherapy, and a shortened waiting period following ingestion of drug. "
"Abstract: Coal tar and petroleum asphalt paints are among the products used as coatings for water pipes and storage tanks to retard corrosion. Formulations of these coatings were tested in the Ames mutagenesis and the mouse skin carcinogenesis bioassays. To test the mutagenicity of the paints, six doses ranging from 0.005 to 10 microliters per plate were assayed. In the mouse skin bioassay, doses of the coal tar paints ranging from 0.2 to 200 microliters were administered topically to 30 SENCAR mice per group. These initiating doses were followed by applications of 1.0 micrograms of 12-o-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in 0.2 ml acetone topically, three times weekly for 20 weeks. Petroleum asphalt paints were tested in groups of 40 animals at 200 and 600 microliters doses. All coal tar paints showed mutagenic activity after metabolic activation with S-9, with the highest response being in strains TA 98 and TA 100. None of the petroleum asphalt paints gave mutagenic responses. Both types of coatings resulted in positive responses in the initiation/promotion study. The coal tar paints gave rise to 1000-1800 times the tumor response observed with petroleum asphalt products. One coal tar product was positive when tested as a complete carcinogen in the mouse at 2 microliters per application once weekly for 30 weeks, whereas the asphalt paint was negative at 100 times the dose. The biological responses to the products were greater than expected from their polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) content. These findings suggest that the hazard posed by these coatings may not be fully explained by their PAH contents. "
"Abstract: The oral bioavailability of methotrexate is variable and may be dose-dependent. The absorption of 'interval' oral methotrexate, which is given between cycles of chemotherapy, is unknown. The bioavailability of oral methotrexate has been studied in eight patients, acting as their own controls, to assess the effect of subdivision of the dose, the formulation, and the timing of the methotrexate within the chemotherapy cycle. The mean bioavailability for all the oral methods of administration was 28.2% +/- 3.7% compared with the same dose given IV. Absorption was uninfluenced by subdivision of the dose, liquid or tablet formulation, or administration on day 1 or day 10 of the chemotherapy cycle. "
"Abstract: The extent to which a controlled release acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) formulation inhibited platelet function has been evaluated in single and chronic dosing studies. In the single dose study, the platelet inhibitory effect of the controlled release formulation was compared with that of an equivalent dose of soluble ASA and an equimolar dose of sodium salicylate (SA). In the chronic dosing study, ASA dose-response curves for platelet function, including cyclooxygenase activity, were determined for various doses (20-1300 mg) of the controlled release (enteric coated pellets) ASA formulation taken by volunteers daily for one week. Platelet function was assessed by the degree of inhibition of aggregation for several aggregating agents, and the degree of inhibition of activity of platelet cyclooxygenase quantified by the estimation of malondialdehyde (MDA) production. Plasma ASA and SA concentrations were also determined in each study. The controlled release product inhibited platelet function to the same extent as an equimolar dose of soluble ASA, but did so with much lower and sometimes undetectable peak systemic plasma ASA concentrations. SA, the direct metabolite of aspirin, did not have any effect on platelet function. The ASA dose-platelet function response curves obtained from chronic dosing with the controlled release formulation appeared to be similar to those reported previously for the soluble product. The inhibition of platelet function appeared to be unrelated to plasma ASA concentrations. "
"Abstract: Photochemotherapy offers a unique approach for the selective therapy of skin diseases. Hematoporphyrin derivative (HPD) in combination with visible light exhibits cytocidal activity in vitro and systemically has demonstrated applicability to the treatment of experimental and human tumors. This study was undertaken to investigate the phototoxic effects in guinea pig skin of systemic HPD in comparison with locally (intradermal) and topically administered HPD. Maximum erythema was obtained by irradiation with red light or UVA 6 h postsystemic HPD (10 mg/kg). Erythema response was dependent upon the dose of irradiation. Systemic HPD produced complete inhibition of epidermal DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis 6-12 h postirradiation with red light, with a lesser degree of inhibition in the deeper hair roots. Local (intradermal) HPD (5-500 micrograms) in combination with red light or UVA produced a dose-dependent erythema and inhibition of epidermal DNA synthesis. Effective in vitro percutaneous penetration of HPD was demonstrated in vehicles containing Azone and N-methylpyrrolidone. Topical application of these HPD formulations in vivo in combination with red light or UVA produced significant erythema and inhibition of epidermal DNA synthesis. These results suggest that HPD can cause photosensitization of the skin. It may therefore be reasonable to explore topical applications as an alternative approach for the photochemotherapy of psoriasis and other cutaneous diseases. "
"Abstract: This two phase study was designed to observe the toxicity and effectiveness of retinoids on oral leukoplakia. The study design included patients who had visible and measurable oral leukoplakia without history of synchronous oral cancer or oral cancer within the previous 2 years. Documentation of the lesion by direct measurement and photography, as well as a biopsy at the beginning and at the end of the study (for verification of the histologic appearance of the lesion), were performed in each patient. Sixteen patients with oral leukoplakia were treated with 13-cis-retinoic acid formulated in a troche in the strength of 1 mg. Three patients received 3 mg/day, 8 patients received 5 mg/day, and 5 patients received 10 mg/day. The initial visible responding event appeared to be a thinning of the leukoplakia with reduction in the whitish surface leaving a reddish, velvety epithelium. If resolution occurred, the velvety area became pink, assuming the color and texture of the normal adjacent mucosa. Toxicity of the drug appeared to be acceptable among the evaluable patients. Of the 11 patients, 3 demonstrated complete response and 6 demonstrated partial response after 6 months of treatment with the drug under study. Recurrences developed in two of the three patients with complete response, and neither of the two showed complete histologic and cytologic regression. One of the patients with partial response went on to complete response after cessation of treatment. Under the condition of our study, a treatment effect was observed with small amounts of topical 13-cis-retinoic acid and that the level of toxicity was acceptable. "
"Abstract: Fifty-two dogs naturally parasitized with Demodex canis and having the generalized form of the disease were utilized to evaluate the efficacy and safety of single or multiple topical treatments with a liquid concentrate formulation of amitraz. Ten dogs (5 treated, 5 controls) were utilized to evaluate a single treatment. A single topical treatment with the miticide did not significantly reduce the incidence of dogs with mites, however, significant clinical improvement resulted. Side-effects were not observed after treatment. Forty-two dogs (26 treated, 16 controls) were utilized to evaluate multiple topical treatments with the liquid concentrate. A series of 3-6 treatments was applied topically at 14-day intervals. The dogs treated with the miticide received an average of 4.5 topical treatments. All (100%) of the dogs responded clinically, and the mean rate of improvement at four weeks post-treatment was 99.1%. Most dogs (96.2%) were cleared of mites after 3-6 treatments, and Mitaban did not cause any dermatologic, ocular, or other clinical side-effects. Multiple treatments with the liquid concentrate were highly efficacious and safe for treatment of generalized demodicosis. Control dogs did not improve clinically and retained mite populations. "
"Abstract: In an open safety-in-use study, the subjective effectiveness and taste acceptability of a new high-potency antacid product were compared to previous treatment in 109 patients presenting with upper gastro-intestinal disorders of functional origin. Severity of the dominant symptoms prior to treatment was compared with that of symptoms present during treatment. Sixty-seven per cent to 73% of upper gastro-intestinal tract symptoms were completely relieved. Eighty-three per cent versus 48% of patients seen in a private practice setting, as compared with the speciality practice, reported good to excellent results, with 92% versus 56% describing good to excellent taste acceptability. When compared with previous antacid therapy, 70% of the patients preferred the new high-potency formulation to the regular-strength products, for both effectiveness and taste. The incidence of product-related side-effects was low, with only 6.7% experiencing the diarrhoea or loose stools commonly associated with conventional products containing magnesium hydroxide. "
Abstract: A total of 132 patients with symptoms associated with either upper respiratory allergies or the common cold was enrolled in this 5-day study. Azatadine maleate/pseudoephedrine sulfate syrup was compared to placebo using a double-blind design. Evaluation of efficacy was based on results in eighty patients and that of safety in 115. Onset of relief was significantly better (p = 0.03) with azatadine maleate/pseudoephedrine sulfate syrup than with placebo. However this was due mainly to the distribution of patients who indicated 'no relief': ten in the combination group as opposed to sixteen in the placebo group. Over-all evaluation of results indicated that a significantly greater degree of symptomatic relief was achieved with the active test formulation than with placebo on both Days 3 (p = 0.03) and 5 (p = 0.04) of therapy. Somnolence was the most frequently reported side-effect. 
"Abstract: This review deals with topical and systemic approaches for protection of human skin against the harmful effects of solar radiation. Two concerns about the deleterious effects of sun exposure involve: (1) acute effects (e.g., sunburn and drug-induced phototoxicity) and (2) potential long-term risks of repeated sun exposures leading to development of solar elastosis, keratoses, induction of both nonmelanoma and melanoma skin cancer, and alteration of immune responses and functions. Action spectra of normal and abnormal reactions of human skin to acute and chronic effects of solar radiation are presented with a view to helping the physician prescribe the appropriate sunscreens. Factors that influence acute effects of sunburn are reviewed. Various artificial methods effective in minimizing or preventing harmful effects of solar radiation, both in normal individuals and in patients with photosensitivity-related problems, are discussed. Emphasis is placed on the commercially available chemical sunscreens and their properties. Sun protection factor (SPF) values of several brand-name formulations determined with a solar simulator under indoor conditions (laboratory) and with solar radiation under natural, field conditions are presented. Factors responsible for variations of SPF values observed under indoor and outdoor conditions are reviewed. Systemic photoprotective agents and their limitations are outlined. The photobiology of melanin pigmentation (the tanning reaction) is briefly discussed, with emphasis on the dangers of using quick-tanning lotions for stimulation of the tanning reaction. "
"Abstract: Fourteen of 29 proprietary sunscreen formulations, including suntan promoters, were found to be comedogenic when applied to the external ear canal of albino rabbits. Ultraviolet exposures enhanced the comedogenic effect. The vehicles, rather than the UV-absorbing compounds, seemed to be responsible. accordingly, sunscreen acne may be a subtype of acne cosmetica. A sampling of UV absorbers showed these agents to be noncomedogenic. "
"Abstract: Riboflavin depletion has been identified in women on oral contraceptives (OC) but change in riboflavin nutriture has not been consistently demonstrated in all OC user groups studied. Discrepant findings in reports have been attributed to differences of pill formulation or riboflavin intake. Aims of this study were to compare the riboflavin requirements of healthy OC users and nonusers on diets prepared in a metabolic unit. A single daily menu and meal pattern was used. The basic diet providing riboflavin at a level of 0.6 mg/1000 kcal was used in the period of acclimation and period 1. In periods 2 and 3, the riboflavin content of the diet was increased to 0.8 and 1.0 mg/1000 kcal, respectively. The riboflavin status of subjects was monitored by erythrocyte glutathione reductase assay and urinary riboflavin excretion. Eight women on OC and 10 nonusers participated. Erythrocyte glutathione reductase assay values and urinary riboflavin excretion showed intersubject and interperiod differences but no significant group differences (OC versus non-OC) in erythrocyte glutathione reductase values or in urinary riboflavin per g creatinine. It was concluded that when dietary intake is controlled, OC do not significantly influence riboflavin status. Riboflavin needs were related to energy requirements of the subjects. "
"Abstract: Stable cream formulations containing 0.1% or 0.2% dithranol in a 17% urea base have been developed. A double-blind comparative trial in 20 out-patients showed that over a 6-week treatment period the 0.2% dithranol and urea cream was significantly more effective (p less than 0.01) than the 0.1% dithranol and urea cream in clearing chronic plaque psoriasis. The 0.2% dithranol/urea cream was accompanied by a higher incidence of minor, irritant side-effects, but was still well accepted by patients for use at home. The availability of differing strengths of dithranol and urea cream enables practitioners to tailor dithranol treatment in accordance with the individual patient's clinical response. "
Abstract: The testing of new dermatologic pharmaceutical formulations is a long and expensive process. The subsequent regulatory submissions to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) involve considerable detail and negotiations. Most dermatologists have only a superficial knowledge of the processes involved in proving the safety and efficacy of new drugs. This article is an attempt to impart a greater understanding of the procedures involved in obtaining FDA approval of new pharmaceutical entities. 
"Abstract: A retrospective review of 20 spine pain patients hospitalized between May 1977 and May 1979, who received pain cocktails was performed to determine the effectiveness of this manner of decreasing pain medication requirements. The primary objective of the pain cocktail is to reduce or eliminate addiction, habituation, and pain medication consumption. The pharmacist is responsible for regulating dosages, performing the compounding, and writing the orders for the pain cocktails. Gradual medication adjustments, based on the patient's need and tolerance, are made. Medication was reduced in 19 of the 20 patients. Twelve patients who started on narcotic analgesics and six who started on pentazocine had a final medication reduction of 71 percent and 51 percent respectively. Five of the 12 patients receiving narcotic analgesics in their initial cocktail were tapered to acetaminophen at time of discharge. Results were favorable and indicate the pain cocktail as a beneficial treatment modality for selected spine pain patients. "
"Abstract: Clindamycin is a macrolide antibiotic that has been used orally and topically in the treatment of acne vulgaris. Unfortunately, oral administration is associated with pseudomembranous colitis in up to 10% of patients; consequently, it is no longer a generally accepted form of acne therapy. Topical application is an effective, safer alternative. Topical formulations may be extemporaneously prepared or purchased as a pre-mixed hydroalcoholic solution. Adverse effects associated with topical preparations are few and mostly minor. Topical clindamycin is also used in the treatment of erythrasma, rosacea, periorificial facial dermatitis, and folliculitis. "
"Abstract: A 2-week, double-blind clinical trial was conducted to compare the efficacy and cosmetic acceptability of amcinonide cream 0.1 percent and halcinonide cream 0.1 percent in the treatment of 29 patients with eczematous dermatitis. The dermatologic status of each patient was rated by improvement in clinical signs and symptoms, by the investigator's overall evaluation, and by two patient evaluations. Both medications produced statistically significant and equivalent improvement by Week 2. However, amcinonide was significantly favored in the efficacy evaluation of relief from burning pain at Week 2 and in patient acceptability evaluations in regard to the absence of burning, stinging, and itching on application. The role of propylene glycol in the formulation of the halcinonide cream as a contributing cause of irritation is noted. "

"Abstract: The effects of four lining materials, Dycal, Procal, Cavitec and Poly F cement on Adaptic and Concise have been investigated in vitro. The parameters studied were surface roughness, hardness and colour both with and without an intermediate (or bonding) resin being present between the restorative material and the liner. The effects of the four liners on the composites varied both between the lining materials themselves and with the composite resin. Two materials, Procal and Dycal, had little interaction with the composites, provided an intermediate resin was used with the latter. Cavitec appeared to have an adverse reaction with the composites and Poly F, whilst having no effect on the colour of the composites, did increase surface roughness. The adverse effects of linig materials were ascribed to minor constituents, particularly methyl salicylate, present in the formulation. "
"Abstract: Photoradiation therapy (phototherapy) is a recently introduced treatment for malignant tumours, which depends on the activation of a photoreactive drug selectively localized to tumours. An experience in 27 patients with haematoporphyrin derivative is described. The haematoporphyrin derivative was activated by light of 630-nm wavelength, which was delivered to cutaneous tumours from a specially designed incandescent lamp and to deep tumours through a quartz fibre from a laser system. Tumours were eradicated in five patients and incomplete tumour destruction was observed in 14 others. The only significant side effect was temporary cutaneous photosensitivity. This form of treatment has considerable potential, particularly when other treatments have either failed or cannot be applied. However, it is premature to formulate indications for its use. Rapid technological developments can be anticipated which will greatly enhance the efficacy of photodynamic destruction of tumours. "
"Abstract: A multicenter, double-blind clinical evaluation of three formulations of betamethasone dipropionate was conducted in 258 patients with severe psoriasis. The results obtained after a standard two-week treatment period clearly indicated that a new glycol preparation produced significantly greater improvement than the ointment and cream formulations currently in clinical use. Twenty-one percent of the patients treated with the new formulation had clearing of all signs and symptoms of psoriasis within the two-week span. Sixty-eight percent of those treated with this new preparation reported complete disappearance of scaling, the major cosmetically disturbing sign of the disease. Adverse drug effects were uncommon and were of a limited dermatologic nature. They were equally distributed among treatment groups "
"Abstract: The results of an open clinical trial of 200 patients in Singapore show that benzoyl peroxide, in a stable gel formulation, both in 2.5% and 5% strengths, was highly efficacious in the topical treatment of acne vulgaris without concomitant systemic therapy. The series included a small number of Caucasians (13 patients) who were also treated effectively. Side effects noted were generally mild and transient. "
"Abstract: A total of 330 patients with eczematous lesions were tested with 27 topical substances. Among the 88 patients with leg ulcers, 85 (2%) were allergic to one or more substances present in one out of two cases of allergy to wool alcohol. Among the 242 patients suffering from eczematous dermatitis, the percentage of allergic reactions reached 54.6%. A great number of allergic reactions of cetyl alcohol (11.2%), chloramphenicol (10%) and sodium lauryl sulfate (6.4%) was observed. These allergens are not included in the European standard series adopted by the ICDRG. The findings are discussed and compared with data taken from the literature. "
"Abstract: A fluorochemical (FC)-resin complex has been developed for use in protective hand creams. Hand creams incorporating this new technology effectively repel solvents and resist their penetration into the skin. The in vitro studies conducted to determine the efficacy of the formulated FC-resin complex include solvent penetration through treated filter paper, solvent repellency on treated pigskin, and penetration of radio tagged sodium lauryl sulfate through treated hairless mouse skin. In vivo studies demonstrate that this new technology does aid in reducing irritation caused by solvent contact. "
"Abstract: Vitamin A acid (retinoic acid: tretinoin) is a vitamin A derivative used in the topical treatment of acne. It acts by 'unseating' comedones, improvement developing slowly over a period of 2 to 3 or more months, and is also said to prevent the formation of new lesions. About three-quarters of patients with acne vulgaris benefit from treatment. In controlled studies, results achieved after a 3 to 4 months course of treatment were superior to those with sulphur-resorcinol-salicylic acid. When compared with benzoyl peroxide, results were variable and appear to depend on the length of treatment, the types of formulations used, and the concentrations compared. Application of vitamin A acid should be continued until the patient has been free of new lesions for several months. Further continued application at a less frequent interval or using a less active dosage form may help to prevent exacerbations of acne. A systemic antibacterial agent such as tetracycline can be given as well as in patients with moderate to severe lesions. Vitamin A acid is used in conjunction with gentle washing (to remove surface oil) but should be applied to a dry skin to avoid unnecessary irritation. Patient education and encouragement are crucial during the initial phase of treatment when microcomedones may be converted to pustules prior to desquamation. "
"Abstract: Four formulations of benzoyl peroxide, two 5% and two 10% gels, were assayed for contact sensitizing capability by the human maximization test. Seventy-six per cent became sensitized. Sensitized subjects reacted to all four formulations. Benzoic acid and related compounds failed to elicit an allergic reaction. "
"Abstract: Parabens are the most frequently used preservative in dermatological medications. Some allergies have been reported to parabens, but these risks must be considered with respect to the benefits of parabens in concentrations used as preservatives in dermatological formulations. Considering the alternatives to parabens in preservat ives and placing perspective on the reported allergies we still find parabens to be a useful preservative with minimal risk to its benefits. "
"Abstract: Phase II chemotherapy trials of dianhydrogalactitol and VP-16-213 were conducted in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had measurable malignant disease which served as indicators of response to therapy. Dianhydrogalactitol was given in a 5-day course at a dosage of 30 mg/m2/day. Toxic reactions included nausea, vomiting, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. There was a definite tendency to a compounding of hematologic toxicity with repeated courses. No evidence of objective therapeutic response was observed among 30 patients treated. VP-16-213 was given at a dosage of 130 mg/m2 on Days 1, 3, and 5. Toxic reactions included nausea, vomiting, alopecia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Hematologic toxicity was more severe in patients with elevated serum bilirubin levels. No evidence of objective therapeutic response was observed among 28 patients treated. "
"Abstract: Crude coal tar has long been an effective and safe form of therapy for psoriasis. However, as compounded in an ointment base it has many objectional features and usually is limited to hospital use. A new tar gel has been studied which appears to equal the effectiveness of crude coal tar, is convenient to apply, and is cosmetically acceptable. This new tar preparation is a valuable addition to the therapy of psoriasis. "
"Abstract: Secondary analysis or reanalysis of data from previous research studies has many advantages. One of these is that data from such studies can identify findings which may be useful in policy formulation, provided the variables are relevant to the problems at hand and can be manipulated. This paper discusses the results of a secondary analysis of data in the Norinyl Acceptor Study which originally evaluated the suitability of the contraceptive pill Norinyl for Filipinio women. The study interviewed 1950 clients from rural health units in the Tagalog region from July 17 to November 23, 1973. In the reanalysis, the statistical significance of variables was determined using analysis of variance and factor analysis. The reanalysis revealed some interesting characteristics of women who go to family planning clinics. Family planning clients were found to exhibit varied family planning behavior patterns which correlate highly with age, number of children, and educational background. Age and number of children appeared to be negative factors in family planning decisions, particularly in the decision to consult family planning clinics. The social, cultural, and psychological reasons for this finding should be studied further. There are also signs of decreasing interest in family planning as both age and number of children increase; these should also be seriously considered in the programming of future family planning campaigns. Factor analysis identified 4 general groups of highly related side effect complaints (psychological complaints, psychosomatic complaints, skin irritations and muscular cramps) manifested at varying levels by different types of women. Medical explanations for this phenomenon are possible, but the myths perpetuated by women regarding the dangers of family planning should not be ignored. The nature and causes of these myths should be studied. Almost half of the original sample of the study dropped out at different stages of the research period. Use of transformation techniques should enable the identification of a sample of dropouts and hence the determination of their characteristics. This paper shows that data reanalysis has its place in policymaking and administration of family planning programs. "
"Abstract: Most women who use oral contraceptives should take daily vitamin supplements in dosages that are carefully regulated to avoid excesses of particular vitamins. Requirements for riboflavin, thiamine, B12, and B6 may be increased by the use of oral contraceptives, whereas niacin requirements may be reduced. Fat-soluble vitamins are also influenced by oral contraceptives. There is evidence of increases in plasma Vitamin-A and decreases in plasma tocopherols in users of oral contraceptives; Vitamin-D, Vitamin-K, and biotin, however, have not been shown to be affected. Normalization of vitamin status can be effected fairly quickly by use of a daily multivitamin. Desirable doses are as follows: ascorbic acid, 400-500 mg; ribovlavin, 10 mg; B6, 5 mg; B12, 4 mcg; and d-alpha-tocopherol, 10 mg; optimal thiamine intake is not known . Clinical signs of hypovitaminosis include depression, susceptibility to infections, and skin signs, all of which were found in users of oral contraceptives in an epidemiological survey of 46,000 women in Great Britain. Adverse psychological, dermatological, and hematological side effects of oral contraceptives have also responded to vitamin therapy. Routine prophylactic prescription of carefully formulated supplemental vitamin mixtures is recommended. "
